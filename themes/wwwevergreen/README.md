A Drupal theme for The Evergreen State College

Where to find things:

* Common header and footer blocks are in the pseudoblocks folder.

* Most other markup is somewhere in the templates folder, with sub-folders
directory: both the indices and the individual pages
home page: this is pretty complicated! Lots of different fields and views going on.
site section: site section header, navigation, and background images

* Some other field formatting is in template.php: spacing and bolding of phone numbers, adding classes to specific image styles, reworking the Submitted by field, creating a nice-looking wording of the quarters.
