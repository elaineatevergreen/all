"Sacred Trees of India: Photographs by Deidi von Schaewen","2014-10-18 18:00:00 to 2014-10-18 22:00:00","2014-10-18 18:00:00 to 2014-10-18 22:00:00","<p>Special Saturday hours for this Exhibition of photographs and video<br /> ""Sacred Trees of India: Photographs by Deidi von Schaewen""<br /> Exhibition continues through December 3, 2014</p> <p>Evergreen Gallery is extremely pleased to announce the fall exhibition, ""Sacred Trees of India: Photographs by Deidi von Schaewen."" For the past 28 years, von Schaewen has traveled in India, immersing herself in its people and culture, and exploring themes through her photography and video. For her series on the Sacred Trees, she traveled the length and breadth of India. The exhibition in Evergreen Gallery is an opportunity to view these lush, complex images in large-scale, to be surrounded by their energy and power.</p> <p>Born in Berlin, von Schaewen studied painting at the Berlin Academy of Arts before deciding to concentrate on photography and film. Currently she is based in Paris. She has exhibited extensively throughout Europe, India, North Africa, and the US. Twenty books of her photographs have been published, with one about Sacred Trees of India due out next year. A continuing obsession of hers is to capture on film the ephemeral, aspects of our urban and rural civilizations that are temporary, fleeting, or vanishing with time. For the Sacred Trees of India, it is more a revelation of devotion and accumulation over time, the ability of trees to survive, rejuvenate, transform – in India, trees are not only sacred to the gods, they can actually BE gods.</p> <p>Von Schaewen was director of photography for a feature film by Robert Cordier in 1972 – a time when it was unusual for a woman to be in that position.

This talk will describe current synergistic research at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory in collaboration with academic institutions that aims to unravel how metal proteins regulate catalytic aspects of metalloenzymatic systems, specifically hydrogenase for conversion of protons and electrons into dihydrogen, methyl coenzyme M reductase for production of methanol from methane, and nitrogenase for synthesis of ammonia from dinitrogen. Evolution has optimized these enzymes to maximize reactant specificity and stabilize reaction intermediates while operating under ambient conditions of temperature and pressure. Our ultimate aim is to learn from nature to design bio-inspired molecular catalysts to replace the energy-intensive processes used today by leveraging biochemical characterization, inorganic synthesis and computational chemistry. This talk will focus on the latter, describing multi-scale computational chemistry applications that resolve key scientific questions about the role of protein structure and dynamics underlying biological catalytic mechanisms with regards to electron, proton and substrate delivery, protein dynamics, and reaction thermodynamics using state-of-the art applications of quantum, classical and statistical physics and high-performance computing.</p> <p>For more information on the event, please contact Dharshi Bopegedera at ext. 6620, <a href=""mailto:bopegedd@evergreen.edu"">bopegedd@evergreen.edu</a></p>","","","SEM II A1105 - The Evergreen State College, Evergreen Parkway Northwest, Olympia, WA, United States","","No","923","2015-10-06T14:17:20-07:00","<span class=""date-display-single"">Wednesday, October 22, 2014 - <span class=""date-display-range""><span class=""date-display-start"" property=""dc:date"" datatype=""xsd:dateTime"" content=""2014-10-22T17:00:00-07:00"">5:00 pm</span> to <span class=""date-display-end"" property=""dc:date"" datatype=""xsd:dateTime"" content=""2014-10-22T18:00:00-07:00"">6:00 pm</span></span></span>"

"Willi Unsoeld Seminar Series - Mark Bittner, Author of The Wild Parrots of Telegraph Hill","2014-10-31 02:00:00 to 2014-10-31 04:00:00","2014-10-31 02:00:00 to 2014-10-31 04:00:00","<p>Renowned for his book, The Wild Parrots of Telegraph Hill: A Love Story, Mark Bittner is the first speaker in the Willi Unsoeld Seminar Series at The Evergreen State College, on October 30. The event, which takes place at 7pm in the campus Longhouse, follows the college’s 2014-15 academic theme of “Paying Attention.” Bittner will discuss a period when, as a street person in San Francisco, he developed an affinity with a (still-vital) flock of wild parrots inhabiting Telegraph Hill. The book went on to become a documentary film and Bittner has gone on to write his forthcoming book Street Song, a memoir.</p> <p>According to Evergreen Vice President and Provost Michael Zimmerman, “the purpose of these lectures is to help us see things in new ways and across differences. Willi used to say the most important thing is how we treat each other… and by extension the way we treat our surroundings,” said Zimmerman. “Mark Bittner was seeing things in a way that others were missing. His message of discovery is important to us.”</p> <p>Willi Unsoeld is a household name among mountaineers, famed for his first ascent of Mt. Everest’s West Ridge in 1963, but Unsoeld had a deep intellectual life beyond the sport of climbing. As a philosopher and founding faculty member at The Evergreen State College, Unsoeld embodied the interdisciplinary spirit of the college. After his death in 1979, the Unsoeld family, friends and colleagues created a legacy in his name for an annual seminar series to take place at Evergreen. Past speakers have included Jim Hightower, Yevgeny Yevtushenko, Terry Tempest Williams, Tom Hornbein and The International Council of Thirteen Indigenous Grandmothers.</p> <p>This event is free and open to the public (excluding parking costs).

Hugo comes to America to fight for the survival of his tribe in the Ecuadorian Amazon, while David goes to Ecuador to launch the world’s first company to certify oil as “fair trade.” Can Hugo become the leader his tribe so desperately wants him to be? Will David clean up one of the world's dirtiest industries? This documentary film is an intimate portrait of two young people finding their voices and trying to beat incredible odds. Their journeys lead them to explore what could be a more just future, not just for the people of the Amazon, but for all people around the world born with oil beneath their feet. Eight years in the making, Oil & Water is a shocking and inspiring David and Goliath story.

From this convergence, a growing set of<br /> activists – from anti-poverty organizers in Toronto to prison abolitionists in Oakland, from occupy activists in New York to migrant justice organizers in Vancouver – are developing shared politics and practices. These efforts combine anti-authoritarian, anti-capitalist, anti-oppression politics with grassroots organizing among ordinary,<br /> non-activist people. Another Politics explores these efforts and distills lessons for building effective, visionary movements. For more information about the book, see <a href=""http://writingwithmovements.com/another-politics"">http://writingwithmovements.com/another-politics</a>.</p> <p>BIO:<br /> Chris, originally from Alaska, is a longtime anarchist organizer, writer, and educator with a PhD from the University of California at Santa Cruz. He graduated form Evergreen in 1999. His writing has appeared in numerous book collections as well as periodicals such as Anarchist Studies, Clamor, Left Turn, and Social Movement Studies. He serves on the board of the Institute for Anarchist Studies and the advisory board for the activist journal Upping the Anti.

Their influence on students has been profound, and their own art-making practice has flourished.</p> <p>The art of both artists parallels the changing environments in their personal and professional lives. Susan and Lucia have highly developed observational skills that they began developing at an early age, in very different environments. At Evergreen, when they taught interdisciplinary programs with scientists, they helped others hone these skills, while continuing to build their own.</p> <p>Susan grew up in the Midwest where her relationship with nature was confined to mostly housing developments. Wild nature roamed in her imagination. Initially Susan concentrated on ceramics, and sculptural elements continue to be important in her artworks. When she came to teach at Evergreen, she gravitated toward two-dimensional art. Her work in drawing, painting and assemblages reflects her interests in mythology and metaphor and her passion for the ever-changing quality of light and color in nature.</p> <p>Lucia grew up on Cooper Point in Olympia roaming the forests and shores of Puget Sound. Trained as an artist and social scientist, Lucia developed an interest in qualitative research methods, ethnography, and environmental education. While teaching with scientists, she developed a practice of field journaling as inspiration for her paintings, drawings, and artist books.

"Native author Roxanne Dunbar-Ortiz speaks at Longhouse May 5","2015-05-06 02:00:00 to 2015-05-06 05:00:00","2015-05-06 02:00:00 to 2015-05-06 05:00:00","<p>Native American feminist scholar and activist Roxanne Dunbar-Ortiz will be speaking at the Evergreen Longhouse on Tuesday, May 5, at 7:00 pm, about her new book An Indigenous Peoples' History of the United States, published by Beacon Press.</p> <p>The publisher describes the book: “Today, in the United States, there are more than five hundred federally recognized indigenous communities and nations comprising nearly three million people. These individuals are the descendants of the once fifteen million people who inhabited this land and are the subject of the latest book by noted historian and activist Roxanne Dunbar-Ortiz. In An Indigenous Peoples’ History of the United States, Dunbar-Ortiz challenges the founding myth of the United States and shows how policy against the indigenous peoples was genocidal and imperialist--designed to crush the original inhabitants. Spanning more than three hundred years, this classic bottom-up history significantly reframes how we view our past. Told from the viewpoint of the indigenous, it reveals how Native Americans, for centuries, actively resisted expansion of the U.S. empire.”</p> <p>“An Indigenous Peoples’ History of the United States provides an essential historical reference for all Americans. . . . The American Indians’ perspective has been absent from colonial histories for too long, leaving continued misunderstandings of our struggles for sovereignty and human rights.”<br /> --Peterson Zah, former president of the Navajo Nation</p> <p>“Roxanne Dunbar-Ortiz writes a masterful story that relates what the Indigenous peoples of the United States have always maintained: Against the settler U.S. nation, Indigenous peoples have persevered against actions and policies intended to exterminate them, whether physically, mentally, or intellectually. Indigenous nations and their people continue to bear witness to their experiences under the U.S. and demand justice as well as the realization of sovereignty on their own terms.”<br /> --Jennifer Nez Denetdale, Associate Professor of American Studies at the University of New Mexico and author of Reclaiming Diné History</p> <p>“An Indigenous Peoples’ History …pulls up the paving stones and lays bare the deep history of the United States, from the corn to the reservations. If the United States is a ‘crime scene,’ as she calls it, then Dunbar-Ortiz is its forensic scientist. A sobering look at a grave history.”<br /> --Vijay Prashad, author of The Poorer Nations</p> <p>“Justice-seekers everywhere will celebrate Dunbar-Ortiz’s unflinching commitment to truth—a truth that places settler-colonialism and genocide exactly where they belong: as foundational to the existence of the United States.”<br /> --Waziyatawin, PhD, activist and author of For Indigenous Minds Only</p> <p>More background on the book at h​t​t​p​:​/​/​w​w​w​.​b​e​a​c​o​n​.​o​r​g​/​A​n​-​I​n​d​i​g​e​n​o​u​s​-​P​e​o​p​l​e​s​-​H​i​s​t​o​r​y-of-the-United-States-P1041.aspx</p> <p>About Roxanne Dunbar-Ortiz</p> <p>Roxanne Dunbar-Ortiz grew up in rural Oklahoma, daughter of a landless farmer and half-Indian mother. Her paternal grandfather, a white settler, farmer, and veterinarian, had been a labor activist and Socialist in Oklahoma with the Industrial Workers of the World in the first two decades of the twentieth century. The stories of her grandfather inspired her to lifelong social justice activism. Married at eighteen, she left with her husband for San Francisco, California, where she has lived most of the years since, although the marriage ended. Her account of life up to leaving Oklahoma is recorded in Red Dirt: Growing Up Okie. She has a daughter, Michelle.</p> <p>Roxanne graduated, majoring in History, from San Francisco State College, a working class public institution, but was selected for History graduate school at University of California at Berkeley, transferring to University of California, Los Angeles to complete her doctorate in History. From 1967 to 1972, she was a full time activist living in various parts of the United States, traveling to Europe, Mexico, and Cuba. This time of her life and the aftermath, 1960-1975, is the story told in Outlaw Woman: Memoir of the War Years.</p> <p>Roxanne took a position teaching in a newly established Native American Studies program at California State University at Hayward, near San Francisco, and helped develop the Department of Ethnic Studies, as well as Women's Studies. In 1974, she became active in the American Indian Movement (AIM) and the International Indian Treaty Council, beginning a lifelong commitment to international human rights.</p> <p>Her first published book, The Great Sioux Nation: An Oral History of the Sioux Nation and its Struggle for Sovereignty, was published in 1977 and was presented as the fundamental document at the first international conference on Indians of the Americas, held at United Nations' headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland. That book was followed by two others in the following years: Roots of Resistance: A History of Land Tenure in New Mexico, 1680-1980 and Indians of the Americas: Human Rights and Self-Determination. In over a hundred trips to Nicaragua and Honduras from 1981 to 1989, she monitored what was called the Contra War. Her book, Blood on the Border: A Memoir of the Contra War was published in 2005.</p> <p>More background on the author at <a href=""http://www.reddirtsite.com"">http://www.reddirtsite.com</a></p> <p>Sponsors</p> <p>Roxanne Dunbar-Ortiz’s visit is sponsored by the Evergreen program “Native Decolonization in the Pacific Rim: From the Northwest to New Zealand,” in collaboration with the TESC President's Diversity Fund, Longhouse Education and Cultural Center, Native Programs at Evergreen, Olympia Timberland Library, Friends of the Library, Center for Community-Based Learning and Action, TESC Tacoma, & TESC programs “Current Economic & Social Issues,” “Reflecting on Activism,” and “Branching Out: Ethnobotanical Gardens.”<br /> For background on Native Programs at Evergreen: <a href=""http://www.evergreen.edu/nativeprograms"">http://www.evergreen.edu/nativeprograms</a></p> <p>Directions</p> <p>The Evergreen State College is located at 2700 Evergreen Parkway NW (the closest parking will be in the B Lot; turn to the left as you drive into campus, and walk the footpath to the Longhouse).</p> <p>For more information on the event, please contact, or see the following website</p> <p><a href=""https://www.facebook.com/events/1600612936891836/"">https://www.facebook.com/events/1600612936891836/</a> </p> <p>Zoltan Grossman<br /> g​r​o​s​s​m​a​z​@​e​v​e​r​g​r​e​e​n​.​e​d​u​</p>","","","Longhouse 1007","","No","850","2015-10-06T14:17:07-07:00","<span class=""date-display-single"">Tuesday, May 5, 2015 - <span class=""date-display-range""><span class=""date-display-start"" property=""dc:date"" datatype=""xsd:dateTime"" content=""2015-05-05T19:00:00-07:00"">7:00 pm</span> to <span class=""date-display-end"" property=""dc:date"" datatype=""xsd:dateTime"" content=""2015-05-05T22:00:00-07:00"">10:00 pm</span></span></span>"

A recent synthesis shows that the global apparent temperature sensitivity of leaf litter breakdown in unpolluted streams and rivers was 0.34 ± 0.04 eV, which was lower than the value predicted by metabolic theory (~0.60 eV). We propose that lower than expected values may reflect ecoenzyme activity as a rate limiting step in the decay process or thermal adaptation my microbes and macroinvertebrates. We estimate that rates may increase by 11-16% with a 2-3 °C average global increase in water temperature, but the balance of microbial and metazoan contributions to leaf litter processing is unlikely to change. Hypotheses and conceptual figures regarding expected effects of elevated nutrients on the temperature sensitivity of leaf litter breakdown will be presented as fodder for an open exchange of ideas.

Today tanoaks are experiencing massive die-offs due to sudden oak death, an introduced disease.

The NAMES Project is one of many examples of the ways we were thinking in an emergency. </p> <p>Today The Quilt includes more than 48,000 individual panels.

This collaborative tour will share stories from Ríos Vivos Colombia, the social movement of dam impacted communities that struggle for the defense of their territories and rivers, and for an energy model by and for the people, and also the work of Polinizaciones, a Beehive grassroots process that collaborates with communities impacted by resource extraction in the use of arts, culture, and communications as strategies for land defense in Colombia, Ecuador, and Venezuela.</p> <p>Using Beehive graphics and other culture and communications work, Polinizaciones creates another way to learn, create, and understand our history in the context of globalization and free trade, militarization, the war on drugs, and the infrastructure and extraction projects integral to IIRSA-Project Mesoamérica. The Polinizaciones sharing session will highlight the Beehive's giant banners, accompanied by photographs, short films, personal experiences, and stories about the communities in resistance we have been weaving relationships of mutual aid with over the last eight years.</p> <p>Throughout Abya Yala, Beehive graphics are being used by youth and community educators within Native, Afro descendent, rural, and urban poor communities as a medium for dialogue and raising consciousness around the current threats against these communities.

The Honduran people are preparing to vote in the first referendum in the country's history. The proposition is to write a new constitution, and a 'yes' vote could dramatically transform the country, perhaps even guaranteeing land for the country's 300,000 landless farmers. But, instead of waking up to ballot boxes, they see soldiers carrying out the first coup d'état in Central America in three decades. This is the story of the two thousand farming families who challenged the coup project by taking over the plantations of the most powerful man in the country. The camera follows three members of the movement, and one clever journalist who travels in from the capital city, as they convert the plantations into cooperatives and install locally the democracy they dreamed of seeing nationally. Shot over four years, the film is both a testament to the capacity of an organized movement to transform the most fertile land in the country, as well as an account of the coup regime's violent attempt to get the land back.</p> <p>The filmmaker: Jesse Freeston is an independiente documentary filmmaker and video-journalist based in Montréal, Québec. Jesse has worked with The Real News Network, teleSUR, Al Jazeera, CUTV, and Vice. He has completed two independent documentaries, the first entitled Revolutionary Medicine: A Story of the First Garifuna Hospital (co-directed by Beth Geglia) and in 2015 he released his first feature-length documentary, Resistencia: The Fight for the Aguan Valley.</p> <p>For more information on the event, please see the following website<br /> resistenciathefilm.com/trailer</p>","","","Sem 2, D1107","","No","1426","2015-11-25T10:08:30-08:00","<span class=""date-display-single"">Friday, November 13, 2015 - <span class=""date-display-range""><span class=""date-display-start"" property=""dc:date"" datatype=""xsd:dateTime"" content=""2015-11-13T11:00:00-08:00"">11:00 am</span> to <span class=""date-display-end"" property=""dc:date"" datatype=""xsd:dateTime"" content=""2015-11-13T14:00:00-08:00"">2:00 pm</span></span></span>"

Or more provocatively, what happens when governance 'no longer confronts us like a subject facing us, but an environment that is hostile to us'? In this talk, I discuss how the traditional concept of politics as conflict is reconfigured by the ecological milieu, a diffusion of complex forces, and non-human actors.""</p> <p>Andrew Culp is a Visiting Assistant Professor of Rhetoric Studies at Whitman College. His work is on the cultural study of new paradigms of power. He recently completed a manuscript, Dark Deleuze and the Death of This World, and his work has appeared in Angelaki: Journal of the Theoretical Humanities, Communication and Critical/Cultural Studies, parallax, Radical Philosophy, and Affinities: A Journal of Radical Theory, Culture, and Action.

Come to The Evergreen State College in Olympia to meet with state officials who are helping to guide carbon policy, hear about their plans first hand, and ask hard questions about how far the state can go toward decarbonizing our economy. Find out what impact these policies will have on economic inequality and social justice.</p> <p>This event is part of the national Power Dialog program designed by Bard College's Center for Environmental Policy, and meetings like this one will be taking place in nearly all states. The goal is to raise awareness about policies to reduce carbon emissions that are going forward, even in the face of obstruction at the federal level. It’s also a chance for your voice to be heard—for you to let public officials know what you think needs to be done to preserve a liveable planet.</p> <p>Washington State’s Power Dialog will take place on April 4, 1:00 – 3:00 pm in the Recital Hall of the Communication Arts building. On hand will be Sarah Rees from the Department of Ecology and Tony Usibelli from the Department of Commerce—and students from colleges and universities around the state. Join us!</p> <p>Here is the plan:</p> <p>1. Prepare for the Dialog. Learn about the Clean Power Plan—the Obama proposal to prod the states into reducing carbon emissions in electricity generation—and Washington State’s planning for pricing carbon and cutting back on fossil fuels. Debate whether these plans go far enough and in the right direction.</p> <p>2. Select a representative to be on stage with the state officials, and prepare a question that expresses the interest of the whole class. We will give all these questions a chance to be voiced and then open the floor to all students who have come for the Dialog.</p> <p>3. Let us know you’re coming. Contact Peter Dorman (<a href=""mailto:dormanp@evergreen.edu"">dormanp@evergreen.edu</a>), a faculty member with the Master of Environmental Studies degree at The Evergreen State College, if you have any additonal questions.

We will participate in some farm work and use our bodies to connect to the land, as well as try some herbal medicines and talk about local medicinal plants. If there’s room, we can have some time to individually connect to the GRuB land with a writing activity. Wear something you are willing to get a little dirty on the farm in.</p> <p>Accessibility: There is a ramp to the GRuB farm house, and fairly flat wood-chipped paths on the farm. Non-gendered individual bathrooms. Bring your questions. CASV's SafePlace trained advocates will be present for support.</p> <p>Check out other events for SVAW presented by the Coalition Against Sexual Violence <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/events/1553100851382516/""> https://www.facebook.com/events/1553100851382516/</a></p>","","","","Coalition Against Sexual Violence (CASV)","No","1855","2016-04-25T10:23:41-07:00","<span class=""date-display-single"">Tuesday, April 26, 2016 - <span class=""date-display-range""><span class=""date-display-start"" property=""dc:date"" datatype=""xsd:dateTime"" content=""2016-04-26T15:00:00-07:00"">3:00 pm</span> to <span class=""date-display-end"" property=""dc:date"" datatype=""xsd:dateTime"" content=""2016-04-26T17:00:00-07:00"">5:00 pm</span></span></span>"

In an intensive year-long program, the members of Thinking Through Craft incorporated a philosophical study of craft with a studio practice. Members of this learning community came with a diverse range of experience, and developed skills in one material over the entire year.

In recent years Parking Services has not generated enough revenue to meet expenses. The result is that a substantial amount of parking lot maintenance—including preventive maintenance that heads off future damage—has been deferred and funds have not been available to adopt technology to better serve users.   Due primarily to concerns about raising fees during a period of steep tuition increases and flat wages (which was the case in 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2013) parking permit and fine rates have not increased since fall of 2007 (and prior to that, not since 2000). In the meantime, parking-related costs and needs have increased and revenue has continued to fall short.</p> <p>These modest increases (approximately $.13-.18/day for permits) are projected to provide the necessary revenue through 2020 to address preservation of existing customer service, deferred lot maintenance, and investments in technology to better serve users.</p> <p>Examples of proposed fee changes:</p> <ul><li>A daily pass is currently $2 and it would increase to $3.</li> <li>A quarterly permit is currently $40 and it would increase to $50.</li> <li>An annual permit is currently $120 and it would increase to $150.</li> </ul><p>For more information on changes to rates, please see these related links:</p> <ul><li><a href=""http://www.evergreen.edu/committee/parking/docs/Parking%20Services%20DTF%202015.pdf"">Parking Services Review DTF Final Report</a> and <a href=""http://www.evergreen.edu/committee/parking/docs/Parking%20Services%20DTF%202015%20Appendix_Part1.pdf"">Appendix 1</a>, <a href=""http://www.evergreen.edu/committee/parking/docs/Parking%20Services%20DTF%202015%20Appendix_Part2.pdf"">Appendix 2</a>, and <a href=""http://www.evergreen.edu/committee/parking/docs/Parking%20Services%20DTF%20VPSA%20Response.pdf"">VPSA response</a>.</li> <li>See earlier response from Wendy Endress, the Vice President for Student Affairs on <a href=""https://commons.evergreen.edu/t/parking-services-review-dtf-final-report-and-response/7126"">Greener Commons</a>.</li> </ul><p> </p> <p>If you are unable to attend, please send comments to <a href=""mailto:corna@evergreen.edu"">corna@evergreen.edu</a> no later than noon on Wednesday, May 25 to participate.</p> <p> </p>","","Library Building","1005","Office of the Vice President for Student Affairs","No","1961","2016-05-10T10:19:03-07:00","<span class=""date-display-single"">Tuesday, May 24, 2016 - <span class=""date-display-range""><span class=""date-display-start"" property=""dc:date"" datatype=""xsd:dateTime"" content=""2016-05-24T12:00:00-07:00"">12:00 pm</span> to <span class=""date-display-end"" property=""dc:date"" datatype=""xsd:dateTime"" content=""2016-05-24T13:00:00-07:00"">1:00 pm</span></span></span>"

In recent years Parking Services has not generated enough revenue to meet expenses. The result is that a substantial amount of parking lot maintenance—including preventive maintenance that heads off future damage—has been deferred and funds have not been available to adopt technology to better serve users.   Due primarily to concerns about raising fees during a period of steep tuition increases and flat wages (which was the case in 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2013) parking permit and fine rates have not increased since fall of 2007 (and prior to that, not since 2000). In the meantime, parking-related costs and needs have increased and revenue has continued to fall short.</p> <p>These modest increases (approximately $.13-.18/day for permits) are projected to provide the necessary revenue through 2020 to address preservation of existing customer service, deferred lot maintenance, and investments in technology to better serve users.</p> <p>Examples of proposed fee changes:</p> <ul><li>A daily pass is currently $2 and it would increase to $3.</li> <li>A quarterly permit is currently $40 and it would increase to $50.</li> <li>An annual permit is currently $120 and it would increase to $150.</li> </ul><p>For more information on changes to rates, please see these related links:</p> <ul><li><a href=""http://www.evergreen.edu/committee/parking/docs/Parking%20Services%20DTF%202015.pdf"">Parking Services Review DTF Final Report</a> and <a href=""http://www.evergreen.edu/committee/parking/docs/Parking%20Services%20DTF%202015%20Appendix_Part1.pdf"">Appendix 1</a>, <a href=""http://www.evergreen.edu/committee/parking/docs/Parking%20Services%20DTF%202015%20Appendix_Part2.pdf"">Appendix 2</a>, and <a href=""http://www.evergreen.edu/committee/parking/docs/Parking%20Services%20DTF%20VPSA%20Response.pdf"">VPSA response</a>.</li> <li>See earlier response from Wendy Endress, the Vice President for Student Affairs on <a href=""https://commons.evergreen.edu/t/parking-services-review-dtf-final-report-and-response/7126"">Greener Commons</a>.</li> </ul><p> </p> <p>If you are unable to attend, please send comments to <a href=""mailto:corna@evergreen.edu"">corna@evergreen.edu</a> no later than noon on Wednesday, May 25 to participate.</p> <p> </p>","","Library Building","1005","Office of the Vice President for Student Affairs","No","1962","2016-05-10T10:19:59-07:00","<span class=""date-display-single"">Tuesday, May 24, 2016 - <span class=""date-display-range""><span class=""date-display-start"" property=""dc:date"" datatype=""xsd:dateTime"" content=""2016-05-24T17:00:00-07:00"">5:00 pm</span> to <span class=""date-display-end"" property=""dc:date"" datatype=""xsd:dateTime"" content=""2016-05-24T18:00:00-07:00"">6:00 pm</span></span></span>"
