    <title>Watersheds: People, Rivers, and Change in Cascadia</title>
    <minimum_credits>16</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>16</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>As the Cascadia region responds to regional and planetary changes in climate, economy, and ecology and tries to find sustainable forms of settlement and industry, water has an essential role. In fact, it has many roles—support for life, productive ingredient, source of delight, and many more. This program will explore key interactions between water and people, as they play out now in three locales in the Cascadia bioregion, and as they may change in the future while the region searches for sustainability.</p><p>Our work will be outdoors as well as in, with several field trips (one multi-day), and opportunities for field observation and regeneration projects alongside lectures, book discussions, lab exercises, and skill workshops. Concepts and information will be drawn from earth system science, public health, sports and recreation, civil engineering, ecosystem management, political economy, and urban design. The emphasis will be on linkages and influences among these topics, because sustainability depends on them working together. The quarter’s goal will be what professionals call conceptual designs, that is, imaginative ideas disciplined by working out how they fit in the settings they aim to improve. The quarter will conclude with presentations in the style of TED talks.</p><p>Students at all levels, from freshmen to seniors, will find challenge and new learning in this program. Moving toward sustainability in American society means finding workable paths for the widest possible range of personal situations, so each student’s unique background will be valuable to consider and build on. Meanwhile, finding one’s place in this uncertain, fast-changing time of transition toward sustainability will be a challenge that each student, and the program as a whole, will confront.</p></description>

    <title>Crisis and Transformation in the U.S.: Political Economy, Class, Social Movements, and Media</title>
    <minimum_credits>16</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>16</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>This program will investigate four periods of crisis and transformation in the US, focusing on their impact on political economy, social movements, and the media.  While crises are often seen as &quot;rough times&quot; unexpectedly and temporarily interrupting what is taken as a &quot;normal&quot; aspect of progress, we will study them as aspects of fundamental change and restructuring which result in opportunities for some and reversals for others, often setting in motion a new political-economic trajectory.</p><p>For many, the economic and political crisis of the past decade was their first experience with a relatively sudden and severe economic downturn in which political priorities are restructured and outcomes uncertain.  Similarly, for many, 2011-12’s Occupy was their first experience of a mass opposition movement.  Yet these were not new phenomena in the US.  We will place our current crisis in historical and theoretical context through the examination of four major periods of political-economic crisis and transformation.  Two periods are well known; our current crisis and the deep depression that bridged the close of World War I to the opening of World War II.  Another largely forgotten period is the &quot;Great Depression&quot; of the late 19th century, out of which emerged a &quot;modern&quot; industrialized United States.  Additionally, we will investigate the first period of crisis, spanning the end of the revolutionary war through the ratification of the Constitution.  Each period was characterized by economic crisis and social upheaval, raising new political-economic possibilities and closing off others, ultimately resulting in a transformation of US capitalism.</p><p>We will also address the crisis of US journalism, providing theoretical and historical context by looking at the way critical  junctures in the evolution of the media (involving print journalism, telegraph, radio, and internet) coincided or not with the major crises of capitalism.  We will pay special attention to how and when the media served the interests of the powerful, and how and when the media served the interests of social movements. </p></description>

    <title>Ecological Niche: The Interface of Human and Animal Behavior</title>
    <minimum_credits>16</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>16</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>
      The word
      <i>environment</i>
      encompasses multiple meanings, from the natural to the built, from the interiors of our minds to the spiritual. In each case there is a constant interface of environments with one another and with other creatures, each defining and circumscribing our experience of the world.   
    </p><p>Some of our essential questions revolve around how we define the environment and how we are shaped by as well as how we shape the environment, both natural and built. For example, does the concept of wilderness include humans? Is the ecological niche of a human essentially different from that of other living things? We will explore the habitats we occupy along with other creatures in those environments. We will explore dichotomies that foster dynamic tensions, such as the dichotomy between concepts of &quot;natural&quot; versus &quot;human.&quot; We intend to investigate these tensions through our study of psychology, personal biography, biology, environmental studies, ornithology, and cultural studies.</p><p>Fall quarter we will develop the foundational skills in environmental studies and psychology needed to understand and critique the writings and current research in community ecology, animal behavior, and conservation biology; and to examine the conscious and unconscious, and the theories of perception and cognition in psychology. We will examine parallels and links among disciplines in terms of methods, assumptions, and prevailing theories. Winter quarter we will continue building on this foundation and move ourselves from theory to practice through an emphasis on methodologies in ecological and social science research, analyses, and their underlying assumptions. Spring quarter we will implement the skills and knowledge we&apos;ve developed through specific student-directed projects and a field trip. Faculty will foster creativity, experimentation, and imaginative processes as means of discovering and bringing a new awareness to our extraordinary world. Students will respond to program themes through individual and collaborative projects.</p><p>To build our learning community we will use experiential collaboration activities such as Challenge and Experiential Education as a means to develop a sense of commitment and group citizenship. We will use multicultural discussion opportunities such as Critical Moments to explore the politics of identity and meaning. We will develop our observational skills via field workshops and field trips. We will have writing and quantitative reasoning workshops to further develop students&apos; current skills and to develop advanced skills in these areas.</p><p>Students completing this program will come to a stronger understanding of their personal lives as situated in a variety of contexts. They will develop strategies for engaging in a range of settings to promote social change, in-depth personal development, increased self-awareness, critical commentary and analyses, and practices that promote stewardship of our personal lives, our immediate environment, and global communities.</p></description>

      This project-oriented program for intermediate and advanced computer science students will weave together the theory and practice of two cross-cutting topics in computer science, pattern analysis, and modeling in the context of

      The overriding question of the program is how pattern analysis and modeling, broadly defined, advance the natural and physical sciences.  
    </p><p>The program will meet for lectures, seminar, workshops, and labs. Particularly in seminar, students will share responsibility for presenting and discussing concepts from the readings and lectures. In addition to seminar and lecture, the program will have two disciplinary components and a project. The disciplinary components will focus on: 1) data mining, machine learning, and pattern recognition and 2) statistics, modeling, and visualization. </p><p>Students will also be expected to apply the computing sub-discipline of their choice to a research paper, or a programming or statistics project, and present their work orally and in written reports. To facilitate projects, faculty will organize small affinity groups that meet twice weekly (once with a faculty adviser) to discuss progress and questions. Projects will begin with a proposal and bibliography, and should be either small enough in scope to be completed in one quarter or a self-contained part of a larger project. While faculty will encourage project work in areas related to program themes (data mining, machine learning, database systems, data visualization—especially visual analytics—networking, security, algorithmic complexity), they will approve other well-defined and promising projects that have a significant computer science or programming component. Projects can be either individual or small group.</p><p>This program aims to give students from Computability and Computer Science Foundations opportunities to continue work begun in those programs. Students who have taken Computability will be expected to complete more advanced work to earn upper-division credit.</p></description>

    <description><p><em>We are all part of an oceanic commons that sustains and bonds all life</em>
      . –Astrida Neimanis
    </p><p>What is the current condition of this commons, what is its past and future, and what do we have to do to sustain it? The fate of the planet and humanity is inextricably linked to the fate of the ocean, in terms of deep (both geological and bathyal) as well as human scales. In this program, we will consider the histories, science, and creative representations which serve as lenses on the health, productivity, resilience, and aesthetic value of the sea.</p><p>In laboratories, on the beach, and on the water, we will learn introductory methodologies in marine science. We will study the history and future of the sea as a resource for our food, energy, and water; a medium for transporting not just goods, but cultural domination; as an inhabitable space; and finally, as a place upon which humanity projects hopes, fears, and dreams. We will study literary and film representations of what it is to work the waters and how it is that the wealth of the sea is depleted, destroyed, sustained, and restored.</p><p>During our time on shore in Olympia, we will have weekly marine science lectures and labs. Two, day-long field trips will take us to ocean beaches and Native maritime communities. Finally, we will spend one week in the San Juan Islands, combining time on the water conducting marine science field studies from the deck of a tall ship, with time in shore-based marine laboratories.</p></description>

    <description><p>This program is designed for students to gain an introductory understanding of the historical role of trade and business in the global economy of today. The age-old urge to trade has led to empires, wars, trade restrictions and, more recently, violent protests against economic and financial globalization.</p><p>This two-quarter program examines the impact of trade on the political, economic, financial, ecological, religious, and energy-related foundations of the U.S. economy. We will explore the evolution of trade from the ancient world to today. Our historical review will help us understand how trade shaped the past and will provide lessons for how trade may well shape the future. As we explore these changes, our goals are to define how the development of trade is part of a society’s natural progression toward prosperity. Several field trips are planned for each quarter, which could include visits to local ports and global business in the Pacific Northwest. The goal of the field trips is to enhance and broaden classroom activities with experiences in real-world settings where we can gain perspectives from people engaged in trade and business. In addition, there will be a large emphasis on writing, including brief and very focused assignments as well as seminar papers. At the end of each quarter students will present their research findings on trade and business in multimedia presentations.</p></description>

    <title>Student-Originated Studies: Community-Based Learning and Action</title>
    <minimum_credits>16</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>16</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>This Student-Originated Studies (SOS) program is intended for students with a background and interest in social science, community organizing, public policy, social movements, and social justice. It is designed for students who are making or have made solid internship arrangements with community-based organizations or agencies or students planning for independent study that involves community-based learning, organizing, research, and participation. Students will develop strong links to organizations, regional social movements, and community mentors and partners, who will be the students&apos; guides and hosts in their work.</p><p>A combination of internship (or individual study) and academic credit will be awarded. Students may arrange for an internship for up to 35 hours a week. Academic credits will be awarded for seminar work on community-based studies, social science, and participatory action research. Students with less than eight credits of internship may supplement their project with accompanying research, reading, and writing associated with their community work.</p><p>The program includes a weekly meeting focused on discussion of readings in social science, community studies, and participatory research. There will be other meetings as needed and in connection with community life and events. Occasionally, seminars may be replaced with relevant campus and community workshops and events.  Students will be doing extensive writing, both as analysis of readings and as field-based journals and reflection. Students will organize small interest/support groups to discuss issues related to projects and to collaborate on presentations at the end of the quarter. Students will submit weekly journals to the faculty sponsor. Contact faculty member Larry Mosqueda (mosqueda@evergreen.edu) if further information is needed.</p><p>The program is connected to Evergreen’s Center for Community-Based Learning and Action (CCBLA), which supports learning about, engaging with, and contributing to community life in the region. As such, this program benefits from the rich resource library, staff, internship support, and workshops offered through the center.</p></description>

    <title>Globalization and the Politics of Walls</title>
    <minimum_credits>16</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>16</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>Although globalization has led to increasing interdependence of societies and peoples, one of the most striking features on the contemporary global landscape is the proliferation of massive walls built between peoples, such as those on the U.S.-Mexico border, around Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, between India and Bangladesh, around Spanish enclaves in Morocco, and dozens more around the world. Students in this global politics program will examine the proliferation of walls in contemporary global society through detailed case studies and theoretical writings in order to understand why wall-building is on the rise today, how these walls affects various populations and why many people are resisting these walls. While these new walls are typically justified in the name of national security and defending borders, we will read diverse critics who contend that these walls may also reflect neoliberal strategies of socioeconomic exclusion between rich and poor and neocolonial attempts to marginalize unwanted populations. Students will also learn about attempts to subvert, repurpose or remove these walls. Through intensive reading, writing, and discussion, students will be asked to develop their own theories about the politics of walls in contemporary global society and to create public installations of some of these wall-building projects as pedagogical exercise.</p></description>

    <description><p><span>What types of problems can be solved by computers? How do humans and computers differ in the types of problems they can solve? What is the future of computing, and will computers evolve an intelligence that includes what we would define as human thought? Can computers learn or create on their own? This program will explore the basics of computer science, how computers work, and their possibilities and limits. The program will include basic programming in Javascript, Web development, introductory computer electronics, and other computer science topics. We will contrast this with human cognition. We will then look at how computers will likely affect the way we live, work, and relate in the future.  In seminar we will explore the issues surrounding machine vs. human consciousness and strong artificial intelligence.</span></p></description>

    <description><p>At a time of globalization, heightened immigration from Latin America, ongoing conflicts between the United States and the Arab/Muslim world, and displacements of many kinds in the Global South, gender issues are inseparable from questions of military intervention, global economic inequities, and community-based struggles for self-determination.  Multicultural feminism in the U.S., while offering important critiques of intersecting systems of power (race, class, gender, sexuality), sometimes overlooks transnational and transborder perspectives that offer a more global understanding of feminism as a decolonizing and liberatory project.   This program will explore contemporary fiction and non-fiction by women in the U.S., Latin America, and the Middle East who literally and figuratively cross borders and national divisions in their work.   This program will explore the relationships between literature and political theory, connections between national and global struggles, questions of religion and spirituality, anti-racism and postcolonialism, gender and sexuality.  We will also consider tensions between recognition of difference or specificity and the possibilities for solidarity and unity.  Writers may include Gloria Anzaldúa, June Jordan, Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, Dionne Brand, Leila Ahmed, Nawal el Saadawi, Maya Angelou, Daisy Zamora, and Rachel Corrie, among others. </p><p>Throughout the quarter, we will situate our close analysis of readings within their historical and political contexts.  We will also view films by and about women in transnational and transborder struggles for social change.  Students will write analytical essays about the program materials, at least one creative piece, and a small project on a writer of their choice. We will also participate in community events relevant to the quarter&apos;s work, including Day of Absence/Presence.  Through our studies, students will gain skills in literary/cultural, historical, and theoretical analysis, and examine textual and film representations as sites of resistance.  Students will also gain a greater understanding of postcolonial, Third World, transnational, and Islamic feminist movements.</p></description>

    <title>China and Japan: Traditional and Contemporary "Silk Roads"</title>
    <minimum_credits>8</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>8</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>This program will introduce the history, culture and philosophy of China and Japan. We will use the theme of the Silk Road in our examination of China as the heart of Asian civilization and Japan as a constant presence at the eastern end of the route.</p><p> </p><p>Our inquiry into Chinese and Japanese history will focus on periods in which foreign contacts were most influential, for example when Buddhism, along with tea, traveled the Silk Road to reach Japan. Japan embraced Chinese culture while modifying it to fit Japan’s political and cultural needs. Japanese language, literature and art cannot be discussed without Chinese influences. Japan is also a repository of both tangible and intangible Chinese culture, which has disappeared from China itself. For example, treasures from the Silk Road, as well as Tang Dynasty dance and music from the 8th century, still survive in Japan. Such a heritage has, in turn, helped produce a present day cultural renaissance in China. We will examine contemporary “Silk Roads” that incorporate new trends, technologies and aspirations.</p><p> </p><p>The program will also include discussions on Asian philosophies, including Daoism, Confucianism, Buddhism, Shintoism and their distinct time/space concepts. We will study the Chinese and Japanese ideographic languages and their embedded worldviews and sensitivities as expressed in poetry and literature, both classic and contemporary.</p><p> </p><p>In the Fall quarter we will study Chinese and Japanese history, along with important cultural concepts for understanding these two countries. In winter we shift our focus to a more thorough examination of both cultures. Students will take part in a three-day Lunar New Year celebration in early February. There will be an optional three-week study abroad trip to both China and Japan starting in Week 9 and extending into the spring break at an estimated cost of $3,500. During Spring quarter students will continue their focused studies through independent or group projects and will have an opportunity to connect their learning with the community. Other program activities include field trips to the Chinese and Japanese gardens in Portland, Oregon; calligraphy demonstrations and workshops, and studying Chinese tea culture and the Japanese tea ceremony.</p><p> </p><p>Students are strongly encouraged to take a Japanese or Chinese language course for four credits in addition to this program.</p></description>

    <title>So You Want to be a Psychologist</title>
    <minimum_credits>16</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>16</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>Students will investigate theories and practices of psychologists to enhance their understanding of counseling, social services, and the science of psychology. We will cover history and systems of psychology. Students will read original source literature from major divisions of the field, including both classic and contemporary journal articles and books by well-known psychologists. Students will explore careers in psychology and the academic preparations necessary for these career choices. We will cover the typical activities of psychologists who work in academia, schools, counseling and clinical settings, social work agencies, and applied research settings.</p><p>Among our studies will be ethical quandaries in psychology, including the ethics of human and animal experimentation. Library research skills, in particular the use of PsycInfo and Science and Social Science Citation Indexes, will be emphasized. Students will gain expertise in the technical writing style of the American Psychological Association (APA). The class format will include lectures, guest speakers, workshops, discussions, films, and an optional field trip.</p><p>There&apos;s no better way to explore the range of activities and topics that psychology offers—and to learn of cutting-edge research in the field—than to attend and participate in a convention of psychology professionals and students. To that end, students have the option of attending the annual convention of the Western Psychological Association (WPA), the western regional arm of the APA. This year&apos;s convention will take place April 27-30, 2017 in Sacramento, California.</p></description>

    <title>Sustainability: Reimagining the Built Environment and the Written Word</title>
    <minimum_credits>16</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>16</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>In this program, we will explore issues of sustainability in the context of the built environment and the community around us.  Through observation, academic and creative writing, research and presentation students will work to define sustainability in architecture--in new, existing, and hybrid structures.  Together, we will answer: How do elements relate to the users?  What is the influence of site?  How is energy use considered?  What does net-zero mean?   How can re-visioning the existing fabric work to achieve more sustainable structures and communities? </p><p>Our focus in this writing-intensive program will be on pursuing ideas and concepts that re-use, re-habilitate, re-energize, and re-define the existing fabric of the urban and suburban built environment.  Through discussion in small peer groups and critical and creative writings, we will examine the ideas presented in the literature.  Students will also practice honing their close reading skills through reflective writing exercises and will develop and articulate their new understandings by means of response papers, reflective journals, bibliographic summaries, and creative assignments. Students improve their ability to write thesis-driven essays defended with evidence from the assigned texts in weekly workshops. They will also be challenged to re-imagine and revitalize the conventional notion of an essay.</p><p>Students will visit local and regional examples of civic and commercial projects that exemplify sustainability goals to help students envision how these ideas are incorporated and expressed in the built form.  Through group research projects focused on site influences and design choices of existing projects, students will identify design elements, document materials choices, and understand energy use.  As part of a culminating project, students will create annotated site plans and use basic 2-D drawing skills in developing conceptual design proposals, supported by written arguments to propose solutions that can re-imagine and re-define a new use for an existing structure. </p><p><strong>This program will be repeated in winter quarter. Students who take this program in fall should not register for the winter quarter repeat.</strong></p></description>

    <description><p>Status updates, selfies, live feeds. In the 21st-century society seems obsessed with capturing reality in the forms of text and images. However evanescent, these digital technologies are modes of documentation. But what is a document? What does it mean to document something? What does it mean to store and archive these documents? As evidence of the present moment, documents are a distinctly modern phenomenon. This is to say that the idea of documentation is born out of the concerns of the Enlightenment and the notions of time and record-keeping that it held dear.</p><p>Using two documentary media—photography and writing—we will explore what it means to create a history of the present. These media will slow down the process of documentation so that we can explore and create more fully and deliberately. We will explore the history of documentary writing and image documentation. We will look at pictures and read literature and theory. Exploring the line between fact and fiction will be a constant concern, as will the cumulative effect of documents in archives of all kinds. We will consider and discuss the status of art in the age of the document.</p><p>Students can expect to learn to use cameras, including black-and-white film photography techniques and darkroom processing. Students can also expect to hone their skills in creative nonfiction, memoirs, travel writing, essays, and other documentary techniques. We will read novels, journalism, autobiographies, and histories from the 19th century to the present, along with some critical theory, to improve our critical reading. Students should expect class time to be equally divided between photography, writing, and lecture/ seminar. We will take pictures and write every week, working toward a documentary study of various aspects of the Evergreen campus.</p></description>

    <title>Working Artists: The Business of Creativity and Art</title>
    <minimum_credits>16</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>16</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>What does it mean to be a working artist? How does the need to make money influence our artistic expression? Are artistic freedom, authenticity, and purity of expression inevitably tarnished once art is produced in anticipation of sale? From the buyer&apos;s perspective, what exactly is being bought? Is it the <em>pure</em> aesthetics of the object or is it the name of the artist being purchased, or even an intimate relationship with the artist herself? How do the artist, the gallery, and the buyer determine the appropriate price? What roles do galleries and other intermediaries play in uniting the artist with the connoisseur? These are not new questions. In fact, artists such as Michelangelo depended on patronage—their artistic expression was defined and constrained by those paying them to be artists. Today this process reaches into every corner of the globe—Australian aborigines, for example, have rescaled their art to easily fit in suitcases of their tourist buyers.</p><p>We will explore these issues in this program, designed for students interested in the intersection of art and business. Our focus will be the economic, cultural, and production dynamics involved in making a living as an artist or entrepreneur in the art world. We will critically explore commercial relationships and market transactions among artists, galleries, collectors, and patrons.</p><p>This program is <em>not</em> a preparatory course on how to make a living as an artist, on marketing strategies, or establishing portfolios and promotional materials.</p><p>Artists who sustain life-long artistic practice and make a living in the process do so by undertaking daily—and often uninspiring—practices. We will similarly engage in daily practice as artists in business, developing skills in intaglio printmaking and personal finance. Our regular rigorous practice will serve both as metaphors for the daily work of artistic production and as opportunities for improving foundational skills necessary for the business of art.</p><p>In addition to seminar, lecture, workshops, writing, and exams, each week will include 12 hours in printmaking and personal finance workshops. Sharpen your pencils, grab your calculators, and join us at 8:23 am sharp.</p></description>

    <title>Political Economy of Public Education</title>
    <minimum_credits>16</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>16</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>Throughout U.S. history, a wide range of politically contested views about the nature of public life have been present. An inquiry into the nature of public life raises the following questions: What constitutes the public? Who should have access? What does the public mean for a democracy? What does it mean for education? What are the implications of neoliberal policies for public education? We further ask: What are the effects of private, state-sponsored charter schools on public education?</p><p>In this program we will analyze competing perspectives about public life and the role of the public through the institution of public education and the sociopolitical and economic contexts in which public schools exist. As a basis for our analysis, we will examine public education and schools broadly, using a macro sociopolitical and economic lens, and narrowly, using a micro school-in-community lens.</p><p>Schools are a human invention with a history. As such, schools change form and adapt in response to social and political pressures. We will examine the significant political, economic, and social tensions on what the term “public” in public education means. We will analyze historical patterns of U.S. schooling from sociopolitical and economic perspectives. This inquiry includes an investigation of the locally controlled Protestant Christian origin of public education and its effects on our contemporary, multicultural environment. We will also investigate the political and economic debates surrounding the expectations for holding public education accountable through high-stakes standardized tests and various federal initiatives. At the micro level we will analyze the school-in-community as a formal institution that socializes groups of children and youth into specific behaviors and roles. This school-level lens examines the socializing process by primarily focusing on the demographic characteristics of the people who make up the power structures of public schools and the dynamics of their interactions as power wielders.</p><p>Fall quarter provides a foundation for winter quarter advanced study, in which students will prepare and present an in-depth research paper. In our collaborative learning community, students will engage in a close reading of texts and write concise analytic essays. Writing is central to student learning in this program. Writing assignments will include text-based seminar, workshop preparations, and research papers. Students can expect to leave this program having developed academic research skills and analytical reading, writing, and speaking to participate in current political and economic debates about the purposes of public education and informed by the historical patterns that have created the present climate.</p></description>

    <title>Computability and Language Theory</title>
    <minimum_credits>16</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>16</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>This program will explore what computers can do, how we get them to do it, and what they can&apos;t do. It is designed for advanced computer science students and students with an interest in both mathematics and computer science. The program covers topics in formal computer languages, computability theory, artificial intelligence, and programming language design and implementation. Students will also study a functional programming language, Haskell, learn the theoretical basis of programming languages, and do an in-depth comparison of properties and capabilities of languages in the four primary programming paradigms: functional, logic, imperative, and object-oriented.</p><p>These topics are offered in four distinct threads. The Formal Languages thread will cover the theoretical basis of language definitions, concluding with a study of what is computable. The Artificial Intelligence thread will cover machine learning and techniques for building intelligent programs. The Functional Language thread covers advanced programming techniques using the programming language Haskell. The Programming Language thread covers both the theoretical basis and practical implementation of programming languages. Students will have a project opportunity to implement an interpreter for a small programming language.</p></description>

S. Eliot, “Two Choruses from the Rock”</p><p>Education is not schooling. Schooling is for fish and maybe for getting a job. Life is not living. Living is what you have to make or, to some, everything that happens between birthing and dying. What could “Education for Life” mean? We’ll read some sages who seem to have wisdom enough to offer answers.</p><p>Annie Dillard muses, “If God does not cause everything that happens, does God cause anything that happens? Is God completely out of the loop?&quot; We’ll see where <em>that</em> comes from and where it leads. Victoria Sweet, a physician, thinks we need to learn to wait. She found herself in many situations where she “was presented with an experience, a person whose value one did not know in advance. What seemed to be good might be bad; what seemed to be bad, good. One didn’t know; one had to wait.” We’ll see if that can mean anything. Martin Buber thinks that sin is not doing the wrong thing but that sin lies in not making a decision. “If there were a devil it would not be one who decided against God, but one who, in eternity, came to no decision.” We’ll see. Charles Bowden asks, “How can a person live a moral life in a culture of death?” and answers, &quot;by saying Yes to life,&quot; all of it. We shall certainly see.</p><p>There are others who might help us claw our way back up T. S. Eliot’s slippery slope to our future. We’ll find some.</p><p>Also, students will learn to write well.  They will learn to craft beautiful sentences.</p></description>

    <title>Physical Systems and Applied Mathematics</title>
    <minimum_credits>16</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>16</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>This intermediate-to-advanced program builds on previous introductory work in calculus and calculus-based physics to deepen students’ understanding of nature, how it can be represented via physical models, and the powerful connections between mathematics and physical theories. We will integrate topics in physics (from classical mechanics, electromagnetism, and quantum mechanics) with topics in applied mathematics (from differential equations, multivariable and vector calculus, and linear algebra). We will also devote time to looking at our studies in a broader historical, philosophical, and cultural context.</p><p>We will integrate theory and experiment in a collaborative environment that mirrors practices of contemporary scientists. By studying classical and cutting-edge problems, we aim to ask increasingly sophisticated questions about the nature of physical reality and develop tools for answering those questions. Through readings, lectures, workshops, labs, and seminars we will examine the principal models by which we describe and understand the physical world, expanding from the realms of our immediate senses out to many orders of magnitude of scale of distance, time, matter, and energy. We will emphasize understanding the nature and formal structure of quantitative physical theories, unifying the concepts and mathematical structures that organize different physical theories into a coherent body of knowledge. Mathematical skills will be developed as needed in the context of their use in the physical sciences. Quantitative problem solving will be emphasized, with computational tools used to gain insight into physical processes. The theoretical focus will be complemented with laboratory work.</p><p>Our theoretical and experimental investigations will integrate mathematically sophisticated and conceptually challenging subject areas, and will require, for well-prepared students, a significant time commitment of at least 50 hours per week, including mastery of prerequisite material, willingness to work in a learning community, practiced time-management skills, and experience balancing intensive work over extended periods of time. The result should be beautiful and mind-boggling insights into our breathtaking universe.

    <title>Wait, What?  How Things Really Work in Science and Business</title>
    <minimum_credits>16</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>16</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>In this introductory-level program we will explore the science, economics, and public policies surrounding debates on topics such as air and water pollution, sustainability and sources of energy, health care, finance, pharmaceutical drugs, and genetic engineering.  Our primary emphasis will be the critical thinking involved.</p><p>Do you really understand the controversial topics of pesticide usage, water pollution, food and drug supplements, economics and finance, economics, or alternative sources of energy? Or do rumors and myths about these issues carry the day? As responsible members of society, we will look at these issues with a critical eye and investigate the scientific evidence, ethical dilemmas, and analytic misperceptions associated with each. We will apply science, statistics, and analytical thinking to separate facts from fiction.</p><p>In winter quarter we will study topics concerning pollution and energy as themes for examining our world, considering subjects such as water use and treatment, and acid rain and the ozone layer. In spring we will look at issues concerning nutrition and health, drugs and food additives, and genetically modified organisms. Students will be introduced to economics and finance during both quarters. Program activities will include lectures, small-group problem-solving workshops, laboratories, seminars, films, field trips, team projects, and student presentations. Through our readings, discussions, and assignments students will pull together ideas and concepts from several subject areas, work collaboratively to develop knowledge and skills, and apply quantitative methods to critically evaluate the facts and debates about the real-world issues above. This work will emphasize quantitative reasoning as well as the development of proficient writing and speaking skills.</p><p>This is a non-repeating, lower division program intended for students seeking to gain an introduction to molecular science, as well as practice with the quantitative methods used in chemistry and business. Strong algebra skills are required to be successful in this work. This program is also appropriate for students seeking to study science or business as part of a liberal arts education. It is not intended as a prerequisite for upper-division work in science.</p></description>

    <title>The Spanish-Speaking World: Cultural Crossings</title>
    <minimum_credits>16</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>16</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>Spain and Latin America share not only the Spanish language, but also an intertwined history of complex cultural crossings. The cultures of both arose from dynamic and sometimes violent encounters and continue to be shaped by uneven power relationships as well as vibrant forms of resistance. In this program students will engage in intensive study of the Spanish language and explore cultural production by Spaniards and Latin Americans in historical context. Every week will include seminars on readings in English, Spanish language classes, a lecture or workshop conducted in Spanish, and a Spanish-language film. There will be regular written seminar responses, synthesis essays, and creative writing exercises. Please note that Spanish language classes are integrated into the program—students do not have to register for them separately. We welcome students with any level of Spanish from true beginner to advanced.</p><p>Fall quarter we will explore cultural crossings in Spain and Latin America prior to the 20th century and examine cross-linguistic influences, questions of epistemology, cultural negotiation, and hybridization in the context of unequal relations of power. We will study the coexistence of Jews, Christians, and Muslims in medieval Spain and the suppression of Jewish and Muslim communities during the Spanish Inquisition. We will also focus on the encounter between indigenous and European cultures after the arrival of Europeans on the American continent. Finally, we will turn to Latin America&apos;s struggles for independence in the 19th century and analyze to what extent they changed or reproduced colonial institutions and structures. Our readings will include historical accounts as well as contemporary cultural products that reexamine and reimagine these encounters.</p><p>Winter quarter, we will turn to the 20th and 21st centuries in Spain and Latin America by considering multiple perspectives on the significance and legacies of iconic historical and cultural events. Possible cases include the Mexican Revolution, the Spanish Civil War, transitions to democracy in Spain and Latin America, the Nicaraguan Revolution, and the impact of unprecedented migration in the Americas. In each of these contexts, we will explore the interrelationships between politics and cultural production and how literature and film can impact processes of social change. Students will have the opportunity to develop a project around a book of their choosing and to engage in local community work.</p><p>Spring quarter offers two options for study abroad and an internship option with local Latino organizations for those who stay on campus. The Santo Tomás, Nicaragua, program is coordinated with the Thurston-Santo Tomás Sister County Association and its counterpart in Nicaragua and is open to four to eight intermediate/advanced language students. The Mérida, Mexico option is coordinated with HABLA Language and Culture Center, and is open to 15 or more students of all language levels. For students staying in Olympia, the program will have an on-campus core of Spanish classes and seminars focused on Latino/a communities in the U.S. and the opportunity for student-originated projects and/or internships. All classes during spring quarter, in Olympia and abroad, will be conducted entirely in Spanish.</p></description>

    <title>Diversity, Multiculturalism, and Public Education: Historical and Contemporary Perspectives</title>
    <minimum_credits>16</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>16</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>What is it about diversity per se that creates social divisions within a society? What diversity topics in particular create passionate opinions across the political spectrum and filter down to public education? How can we explain these varying worldviews so that we come away with a deeper and fuller understanding of why these debates endure? What is it about diversity and multiculturalism that can elicit such strong emotions with varying effects on the social and economic well-being of individuals and groups? How does public education contend with diversity and multiculturalism? These are among the questions we will explore.</p><p>This introductory program provides an overview of contemporary diversity issues that manifest in contentious debates in countless settings around the world. Writing and speaking are central to student learning in this program. In our collaborative learning community, students dialogue through a close reading of texts and write concise analytic papers as well as preparing papers for text-based seminar and related activities.</p><p>The primary focus of this program is on the United States, with examples of the effects of these issues for school-age children on their life opportunities and economic well-being. This overview fuses history and political economy to find patterns and connections from the past to the present, including how multiculturalism has its roots in contested diversity. This further requires an inquiry into different worldviews or ideologies and the effects on public education.</p><p>Among topics considered are skin-color consciousness and racial colorblindness, impact of racial and ethnic identification, what constitutes a crime and just punishment, analysis of economic class in interaction with culture, immigrant and indigenous experiences, and patriarchy and its intersections with gender, sexuality, and religion. Students can expect to leave this program with a deeper understanding of the roots and implications of major social issues regarding diversity and multiculturalism.</p></description>

    <title>Music Matters</title>
    <minimum_credits>16</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>16</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>Music, its meaning, importance in human lives, and role in human civilizations have been topics considered by philosophers from ancient Greece to the present day. What do our experiences of music have to do with our intellectual understanding of the subject? In what ways does the experience of performing music differ from the experience of listening? Are there approaches to listening that result in more meaningful engagement with the music?</p><p>In this program we will explore points of intersection between music as it is created and perceived in the moment, philosophical writings about music from antiquity to the present, and theoretical principles that influence our musical experiences and understanding. Our work with progressive skill development will require physical immersion into the practices of listening, moving, and making music. Theoretical, philosophical, and literary studies will require the development of a common working vocabulary, writing skills, and critical-thinking skills. Weekly activities will include readings, lectures, seminars, and interactive workshops designed to encourage students to expand and meld their creative interests within an intellectual infrastructure. Performance workshops will provide opportunities to gain firsthand understanding of fundamental skills and concepts as well as the transformative possibilities that exist through honest confrontation of challenging experiences. Writing workshops and assignments will encourage thoughtful consideration of a broad range of program topics. This balanced approach to the development of physical craft, artistry, and intellectual engagement is expected to culminate in a significant written and performance project.</p></description>

    <title>Field Plant Taxonomy and Conservation</title>
    <minimum_credits>16</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>16</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>How can we identify, track, characterize and measure patterns in floristic diversity? How can plant taxonomists help to assess the health of ecosystems? How can scientists help to protect species and preserve the ecosystems that support them? This program fosters field plant taxonomy skills needed to address such questions for both vascular and non-vascular plants (bryophytes). Lectures topics will include plant systematics, ecology and evolution, as well as plant biodiversity and conservation. Students will learn about the importance of herbaria as the basis for all scientific inquiry and will have the opportunity to learn about how plant specimens that reside in herbaria can serve as both physical and genetic resources for examining patterns in species diversity and distribution.  </p><p>
      In lab, students will learn how to use Hitchcock and Cronquist&apos;s
      <i>Flora of the Pacific Northwest</i>
      , and other technical keys for identifying unknown plants. We will spend time in the field and laboratory discussing diagnostic characters of plant families with emphasis on both vascular and non-vascular plants. In the field, students will have the opportunity to learn vegetation sampling methods including small and large-scale plots, species-area sampling and transects). Students will also learn the difference between characterizing the average abundance of species in plot data, and getting a complete inventory of plants at a site.
    </p><p>Seminars will provide students with the opportunity to delve deeply into local plant biodiversity and conservation topics, including threats to Pacific Northwest plant communities such as climate change, small and large scale disturbances (e.g., fire, grazing, and air pollution). Individual and group research projects will included an herbarium curation project, as well as a scientific writing and presentation component relating to a rare plant species or habitat from the Pacific Northwest.</p><p>A multi-day field trip to Sun Lakes State Park as well as multiple day-long field trips will give students an opportunity to learn about Pacific Northwest plant communities in the field, including sagebrush steppe, prairies, oak woodlands and coniferous forests. Students will be expected to maintain a detailed field journal and will be taught basic botanical illustration skills to support this work. Field trips are an essential part of the program and required. Students will also learn to properly collect plant specimens and prepare museum-quality collections that will be deposited in the Evergreen Herbarium.</p></description>

    <title>Deviance, Crime, and Punishment in the Past and Present</title>
    <minimum_credits>16</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>16</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>How have deviance and crime been viewed differently in societies over time, and how have punishments for deviance and criminal behavior varied by society and historical period?</p><p>This program will engage in historical and sociological studies of deviance, crime, and punishment. Our studies will primarily entail a comparison of contemporary American and Western European societies with their historical roots from the 16th century to the present. We will examine themes of power, social control, surveillance, and resistance as they relate to the evolving social definitions of deviance, crime, and punishment. Within these overarching themes, we will consider topics such as crime waves, hysteria, identities, bodies, prostitution, witchcraft, genetic determinism, and the media sensationalization of crime.</p><p>This program involves extensive student-initiated studies, and students will learn how to conduct historical and sociological research on a topic of their choice. During the 10-week period spanning the second half of winter quarter and the first half of spring quarter, students will have the option of pursuing their independent research interests or participating in an internship for up to 40 hours a week, the equivalent of 16 credits. During this time, students will communicate electronically with faculty and peers to discuss their learning, and students working locally may meet with faculty and peers every other week for seminar discussions.</p><p>Students will return to the classroom in the middle of spring quarter to reflect on, critically examine, and integrate their fall quarter theoretical and methodological learning with their winter and spring quarter research or practical experience. The major project this quarter for interns will be a synthesis paper that details this integration. Research students will produce a research paper that represents a culmination of their best writing and thinking abilities.</p><p>Our studies will be grounded in sociology and history, but will turn to other fields, including anthropology, biology, law, and media studies, to enrich our understandings of deviance, crime, and punishment. Throughout the year students will engage in seminars, films, workshops, fieldwork exercises, writing, and research projects designed to deepen their knowledge and apply theory to real-world situations.</p></description>

    <title>Movements and Migrations:  Sustainability and Change in Religion and Culture.</title>
    <minimum_credits>16</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>16</maximum_credits>
    <description><p class="NormalWeb1">Cultures are always changing; traditions persist, evolve and take on new shapes over time.</p><p class="NormalWeb1">In this program, we will look at religious and cultural <strong>movements</strong> in South Asia and the Middle East. We will look at the roots of Islam, Hinduism, and Buddhism and ways they have traveled and changed over time. We will also explore the ways that some of their principles and lived practices inform sustainability and justice movements today. Yoga, for example, is a transnational phenomenon with roots in some of the same texts and traditions that have given rise to Hinduism. Buddhism, also arising in South Asia, has made its own popularized journeys around the world. Global understandings of Islam range from transnational Sufi movements to fearsome groups such as ISIS to Islamophobia. All of these traditions offer lessons for living respectfully with the natural world, and for overcoming injustices and inequality. </p><p>Focusing on South Asia and the Middle East, we will explore differing religious and cultural world views on the environment and humans’ place within it as well as how religious traditions interact with politics on the ground. We will look at both historical foundations and contemporary lived cultural and religious traditions.  In South Asia, we’ll examine cultures in the Himalayan region as warming temperatures melt critical glaciers and multiple dams potentially increase the risk of earthquakes. We will explore development models for rural communities in India and Nepal, focusing on food and forests. These every day issues are crosscut by religious practices and social movements often rest on the foundations of religious principles. In the Middle East, we will explore ways that orthodoxy in Islam gets shaped and reshaped. As we explore how Islam and political Islam are lived and changed, we uncover the paradox that orthodoxy, which implies immovability and constancy, undergoes movements and migrations of its own. </p><p class="NormalWeb1"><strong>Migrations</strong> of peoples, materials, and ideas have been around for millennia, often producing vibrant practices based on adaptation and innovation. Yet colonization and capitalist globalization have also contributed to the systematic destruction of indigenous and non-Western cultures, inciting various forms of resistance. How do transnational relationships affect the integrity, identity, and sustainability of local communities? How do religion and culture serve to sustain or separate communities in a world of mass migrations due to political, economic, and environmental disruptions?</p><p>Through the lenses of religious studies, cultural anthropology, and sustainability studies, we will explore tensions between movement, migration, and rootedness, the familiar and unfamiliar, and how movements for justice are conditioned by both individual and systemic change. We will draw on yoga, both as an example of cultural exchange that has fueled debates about authenticity and appropriation, and as a practice of sustainability from the inside out. In fall quarter, our intentional learning community will build theoretical foundations and develop skills in cultural analysis through critical reading, expository writing, ethnographic methods, and seminar discussions. Students will have options for reflective work through yogic practices. In the winter, some students will travel to Nepal to think on the ground about issues of sustainability, religion, boundaries, biomigration, natural disasters and population shifts. Other students will develop local projects on topics of their choice related to program themes. Students can also participate in a religious module focused on studying notions of “God” in different religious traditions.  Spring quarter students will continue to develop projects, with options for local internships and community partnerships, as we continue with weekly thematic explorations. Through the use of workshops, students will develop proficiencies in ethnographic methods, sustainability practices, yoga, and writing.</p></description>

    <title>Teaching English Language Learners: Culture, Theory and Methods</title>
    <minimum_credits>16</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>16</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>In this program, we will explore the role of family and community in language acquisition and identity formation among K-adult English Language Learners (ELLs). We will examine how certain contextual factors such as history, political climate, school policies, and curriculum impact the education of language learners from adults to students in grades K-12. We will also study language acquisition theory, teaching methods, curriculum design, and implementation of theory to instructional practice relevant to Washington K-12 English Language Development standards as well as TESOL (Teachers of English to Speakers of Other Languages) standards for adult ELLs in local as well as international settings.</p><p>These ELL concepts will be analyzed through readings, group collaboration, workshops, student-led seminars, lectures, and multimedia/video. Students will lead discussions, complete reflective writing activities, conduct teaching demonstrations, and create a community ethnography project. Writing and research workshops will also be a focus of this program.</p><p>In the fall the program will survey the history of second language education in the United States, while introducing central issues in language acquisition research. We will also discuss the role of dominant and minority communities and culture in identity formation of English language learners, their lived experiences and how knowledge of both family and community can inform school policies, curriculum, and instruction. We will begin our research and tutoring activities in local K-12 settings.</p><p>In the winter the program will focus on study of language as a system with an emphasis on linguistic, literacy, and content-area K-adult instructional strategies. Among topics addressed will be English phonology, morphology, and syntax as well as implications for teaching the four language skills: listening, speaking, reading, and writing. We will also continue our K-12 ELL tutoring practices in the local schools with an emphasis on content-area instruction and academic-language development.</p><p>Reading topics will include the history of ESL/bilingual education, immigrant learners in the public schools, introduction to ESL/ELL teaching methods, language acquisition theory, literacy and linguistics for ELLs, assessment, sheltered instruction, as well as the practice of culturally relevant pedagogy.</p></description>

    <title>Agroforestry Systems</title>
    <minimum_credits>16</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>16</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>Agroforestry is a land management system that combines cultivated trees with crops and/or livestock in ways that are beneficial to humanity and the environment. In this science-intensive and rigorous program, students will read, discuss, and write summaries of popular books and peer-reviewed scientific literature to understand how ecological theory and technical agroforestry practices are applied to design windbreaks, alley cropping, silvopasture, riparian buffers, and forest farming production systems. Growth characteristics and cultural practices of perennial fruit- and nut-bearing species used in agroforestry systems will be taught. Day and overnight field trips will highlight opportunities and challenges to implementing agroforestry concepts, with particular emphasis on forest farming and edible forest gardens. Students will complete and present an agroforestry research project that includes a scientific literature review and applied design project of their choice.</p></description>

    <title>Culture Matters: Cross-Cultural Concepts in Communication and Psychology</title>
    <minimum_credits>16</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>16</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>How does culture matter? How is our sense of self and others culturally situated? This program will attempt to answer these questions through the study of cultural psychology and cross-cultural communication. Exchange students from Daejeon University in Korea will join Evergreen students in this program to engage in a cross-cultural examination of social/cultural norms, values, and practices. Our studies will focus on culture in relation to ideological values (including ideas about gender, family, body aesthetics, community, work, and education), language and perception, nonverbal communication including use of space, emotional experience and expression including cultural “feeling rules,” ritual including meanings and social functions, and cognition including judgment and decision-making. We will draw primarily on cross-cultural communication and psychology literature but include some study of cultural, historical, and political/economic material in order to deepen our understanding of cultural contexts.</p><p>Evergreen students will learn basic introductory language skills in Korean reading, writing, and speaking. They will also learn useful communication strategies for helping Korean speakers improve English language skills. All students will work on increasing their intercultural competence as we exchange ideas and cultural practices, taste each other’s favorite foods, interact with local Korean immigrant communities, watch U.S. and Korean films, and interview each other on thematic interests of cultural difference and similarity. In addition to engaging in reading, writing, and research assignments, students will collectively produce audio recordings on cross-cultural themes for possible broadcast on local community radio.</p></description>

    <description><p>
      Historically, art and the work of art emerge as simultaneously debased and exalted cultural categories, treated as both epitome
      <em>and</em>
      critic of commodity culture, a space apart
      <em>from</em>
      and the ironic fulfillment
      <em>of</em>
      the market economy. In this sense, they come to us as historically specific practices and discourses specific to “modernity.”  Sianne Ngai suggests that &apos;zany,&apos; &apos;interesting,&apos; and &apos;cute&apos; are the aesthetic categories best suited for grasping &quot;how aesthetic experience has been transformed by the hypercommodified, information-saturated, performance-driven conditions of late capitalism.&quot;
    </p><p>
      In order to investigate this emergence, we will work between visual studies, philosophy, and art practice. The program will offer studies in visual and cultural studies, art and media practice, and 18
      <sup>th</sup>
      -20
      <sup>th</sup>
      century philosophy, writing regular critical essays in response to both theory and works of art. We will be interested in the increasing centrality of “aesthetics” in philosophy and the appearance of an aesthetic crisis within the worlds of art-making and criticism, the uneven emergence of industrial production and its representations, and transitions to the conditions understood as late-capitalism. Following our study of the early 20
      <sup>th</sup>
      century avant-garde work and the emergence of cinema, we will look to the rise of conceptualism in art in the 1960s and 70s.  From there, we will turn to contemporary forms and institutions of art that are grappling with the question of art as labor and artists as workers under current economic pressures. We will also look at the interventions of feminist thinkers and artists in art history and film studies, as well as psychoanalytic and structuralist approaches to art criticism and theory.
    </p><p>We will study a range of theorists, artists, objects and practices, as well as popular and comedic forms. We&apos;ll read texts in philosophy and critical theory by Kant, Hegel, Marx, Nietzsche, Freud, Arendt, Adorno, Benjamin, and contemporary critic and thinker Sianne Ngai. We&apos;ll study artists associated with the Bauhaus, abstract expressionism, minimalism and post-minimalism, New Wave and Third Cinemas, feminist, conceptual, pop and contemporary practices of neo-pop and social practice, art fairs and collectives, and read related art historical and visual studies texts.</p><p>
      In the fall and winter our creative practice will focus on Bauhaus-style design and materials experimentation, with color experiments, paper sculpture, and drawing, as well as handmade and cameraless approaches to photography and film, supported by both foundational work in philosophy and art history and the development of those critical and creative research skills needed for spring project work. In the spring, we will turn to the contemporary art world and late 20
      <sup>th</sup>
      century-contemporary film.  Each student will develop an individual line of research, reading, and creative production, resulting in a substantial interdisciplinary project, supported by their participation in small self-organizing groups. The program will go on at least one retreat, and one to two field trips to museums, galleries, and films each quarter.

    <title>Reading Between the Lines: U.S. Women of Color in the 20th Century</title>
    <minimum_credits>16</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>16</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>The 20th century has not been the exclusive domain of Euro-American men and women in the U.S., yet it often requires reading between the lines to realize that women of color have also existed at the same time. Repeatedly, women of color (e.g., African-American, Native American, Asian-American, Latina/Chicana) have been stereotyped and have endured multiple oppressions, leaving them seemingly voiceless and invisible.</p><p>Such circumstances have hidden from view how these same women were active agents in the context of their times, who worked to protect their cultures, languages, and families. These women of color often resisted the passive victimization associated with them. Gaining an introduction to such women of color can broaden and enrich our understanding of what it has meant to be a woman and a U.S. citizen in the 20th century.</p><p>Drawing upon autobiographies, poetry, short stories, essays, and films we will explore the ways in which women of color defied stereotypes and contributed to the economic, social, political, and cultural life of the contemporary United States. We will critique how feminist theory has both served and ignored these women. We will analyze how 20th century U.S. women of color survived, struggled, challenged barriers, and forged their own paths to make life a little easier and better for the next generation of women and men.</p><p>Students will develop skills as writers and researchers by studying scholarly and imaginative works and conducting research. Through extensive reading and writing, dialogue, films, and guest speakers, we will investigate important aspects of the life and times of women of color in the 20th century.</p></description>

    <title>Philosophy as Practice: Contemporary Pragmatism</title>
    <minimum_credits>16</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>16</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>
      Pragmatism has recently emerged as a vital and radical current in contemporary philosophy. “-Isms” are elusive identifiers, but a good handle on pragmatism is that it&apos;s an approach to philosophical questions by way of our social practices, rather than by way of claims about our seemingly most distinctive and deep human faculties such as reason or experience. Pragmatists turn away from abstract theories towards practical outcomes in their explorations of “what can we
      <em>really</em>
      know?” or “what
      <em>really</em>
      exists?” or “what
      <em>really</em>
      are we, as humans?” or &quot;what is the
      <em>true</em>
      basis of morality?&quot;
    </p><p>
      We will begin with some of the foundational works of American pragmatism, selections from writings by Charles S. Pierce, William James, and John Dewey. But our more concentrated focus will be on work carried out in the 1960s, ’70s, and later. We will study seminal essays by Wilfrid Sellars, W.V.O. Quine, Donald Davidson, Richard Rorty, and perhaps others—works that inspire an ongoing renaissance of pragmatism in contemporary philosophy. We will end the quarter studying recent developments offered by Robert Brandom, Rebecca Kuhkla, Mark Lance, and others. Our readings also will include Orwell’s
      <em>1984</em>
      and perhaps other works of fiction, and we will watch some of the many films that explore knowledge and being in philosophically rich ways.
    </p><p>Students will be expected to read difficult works closely, explore their thinking in small-group discussion, and write both short and longer essays that sharpen the questions and tentative answers that arise in the course of their studies.</p></description>

    <minimum_credits>16</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>16</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>In this Student-Originated Studies (SOS), faculty will support student research, learning, and practice in a cluster of areas linking political economy, economic justice, and global justice with local, national, and global social movements. There will be especially strong support for students developing projects that are connected to local communities, groups, and organizations. Although students will register for this program, you will be primarily doing independent study and/or an in-program internship. This program offers opportunities for serious, responsible, and self-motivated students to create their own course of study and research in which you are encouraged to work with the broader community. The SOS will have close ties to Evergreen’s Center for Community-Based Learning and Action (CCBLA). The CCBLA will serve as the center and support for this study—for learning about, engaging with, and contributing to community life in the region.</p><p>Students, through individual or group projects, will be able to link with social movements, nonprofits, community groups, and economic and social justice organizations that focus on the issues listed above. Students will benefit from faculty knowledge of and experience with local organizations, and experience working with students across the curriculum who are interested in learning through community-based research, learning, and activism. The CCBLA will also be a key resource and can assist students in developing ideas and contacts.</p><p>We will meet together once a week for four hours. We will combine seminar on books and articles with films, faculty and guest lectures, workshops, and time for groups of people who are working on similar projects and study to meet together to share experiences, ideas, and learn from each other. In addition, students will meet with faculty in small groups every other week to discuss progress, ideas, feedback, etc. Toward the end of spring quarter, we will organize a public campus event to share our research and make connections between groups we are interning with and the Evergreen community.</p></description>

    <description><p dir="ltr">This program offers students ready for intensive full-time work in the theory and practice of visual and/or media arts opportunities to pursue year-long individual or collaborative capstone projects. This advanced program is designed for students with a broad interdisciplinary background in the liberal arts and significant in-depth studies in one or more of the visual or media arts. These may include 2-D practices such as drawing, painting, printmaking, photography; 3-D design or sculpture; installation or performance; video, film or animation; digital or interactive arts; and sound design. Students with a significant background in media theory or art history and who wish to deepen their studies to include an arts-based practice or academic project, such as museum studies or curatorial practices, or an arts-related internship are also welcome.</p><p dir="ltr">Building on perspectives and approaches developed in previous work in visual and/or media arts, and prior interdisciplinary program work, students will pursue research agendas, share their findings in presentations, develop projects based on that research and practice skills in conceptual design and project planning. They will work intensively together, producing a significant body of thematic work in the context of a supportive, critical, and creative learning community. Students may develop projects in a wide range of media and media forms to investigate an even wider range of themes and questions. Students will engage in reading, reflective and theoretical writing, rigorous weekly critiques, targeted technical skill workshops, and professional development opportunities for those contemplating graduate school or post-college careers in media and/or visual arts related fields. Students will attend frequent presentations by visiting artists and scholars to broaden their fluency with themes and concerns of contemporary arts and culture.</p><p dir="ltr">In fall, students will engage in a series of generative, conceptual design exercises and research activities to define the direction of their work for the year and expand their facility with technologies, materials, and creative approaches. Students whose backgrounds are primarily in the media arts will have opportunities to expand their visual arts technical skills, specifically in sculpture, ceramics, and 3-D design. Students whose training is primarily in the visual arts will gain skills in animation and other time-based forms. Fall quarter will include an overnight, off-campus retreat.</p><p dir="ltr">In winter, the focus shifts from concept development to practice and production. Work-in-progress critiques will be central as students engage in regular critical analysis of one another’s creative work. Students will also collaborate on short research projects about contemporary artists who have attempted to push the technological and conceptual boundaries of the visual or media arts. During spring, students will complete their projects, engage further in extensive critiques, produce a public exhibition of their works, and develop a professional portfolio and related documents.</p><p>This program offers students ready for intensive full-time work in the theory and practice of visual and/or media arts opportunities to pursue multi-quarter individual or collaborative capstone projects or media and arts-related internships.

    <description><p>This program is the home for Evergreen media internships. Media internships provide advanced students opportunities to gain deep knowledge of specific media concepts and skills in the context of a tightly-knit cohort who collaborate on developing academic and creative research agendas that parallel and are informed by their work as interns. Internships involve about 30 hours per week for 12-14 credits per quarter and are available in animation/imaging, audio, Media Loan, multimedia lab, music technology, production, video production, and video post-production. Each intern gains and strengthens instructional, technical, research, organizational, leadership, communication, and collaborative skills as they work with supervising staff associated with each of these areas to support instruction, maintenance, and administration of facilities, and to fulfill campus production needs.</p><p>The Media Internship program includes  two to four credits of academic inquiry per quarter that will involve individual research in the critical history of specific media technologies with an emphasis on the social, cultural, and economic influences on their development and adoption by both mainstream and alternative producers. As students expand their practical and theoretical knowledge of media technologies, they will examine their own roles as producers, artists, teachers, and leaders through reflective writing and through the production of both individual and collaborative creative media projects. Interns meet weekly as a group with staff or faculty to share skills, seminar on readings or screenings, peer review writing, and collaborate on projects, productions, and cross-training in all Media Services areas.</p><p>
      The Media Internship program requires a year-long commitment from fall through spring quarters. For more details, including information about each specific internship, prerequisites for them and how to apply, please refer to

    <title>Paris Muse: Evoking Place in Literature, Art, Music, and Myth</title>
    <minimum_credits>4, 12, 16</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>4, 12, 16</maximum_credits>
    <description><p><em>&quot;An artist has no home . . . except in Paris,&quot;</em>
      F. Nietzsche
    </p><p>What power of evocation made Paris the center, a hive of salons generating energies for creative risks and intellectual vibrancy? Baudelaire prowled her streets, Mallarmé drew a world of poets to talk poetry. Dadaists, surrealists and existentialists made Paris cafés hubs of pure creativity. Stravinsky and Nureyev launched modern music and dance there, and philosophy effected alchemical alliances with poetry, sociology, and psychology. From Africa, the Caribbean, and the U.S. came brilliant black writers and musicians like Senghor, Césaire, Baldwin, and Bechet. Paris lured Wilde, Beckett and Pound, Picasso and Stein. Energies, arts, and beats of diverse French-speaking cultures mingle there—Martiniquan, Moroccan, Senegalese, and Haitian among others.</p><p>Nietzsche writes that “existence and the world is justified only as an aesthetic phenomenon.” Perhaps Paris is the city of artists because her energies call us to recreate beauty – to recreate our language, our arts and thought, our existence. The program will work to uncover the creative secrets of this muse.</p><p>Seminars—our salons—will analyze the novels, poems, philosophical texts, images, and musical compositions woven into Paris’s past, and create our own in response in creative workshops. All students will attend lectures and seminars in aesthetics, philosophy, literature, and music that emanates from the Parisian “metropole.” Students will also choose to specialize in book arts, creative writing, literary analysis and theory, black-and-white photography, or music studies. French language will be taught at three levels throughout the year. French study will be required for those planning travel to France in spring. Language study is optional, and encouraged, for students not traveling to France.</p><p>Fall and winter quarters will entail intensive study of Parisian movements from the decadence of Baudelaire, Rimbaud and Mallarmé through surrealism, into existentialism, absurdism, oulipo, négritude, and critical theory.</p><p>In spring, students have two options. Travel to France, where they will spend three weeks in the ancient town of Rennes, Brittany for exploring the deeply Celtic (Breton) heritage, intensive French study, then three weeks in Paris for fieldwork in arts and music. Finally all will travel south on a &quot;vagabondage&quot; to discover their individual places of inspiration and complete a writing project evoking their place. Alternatively, students may remain on campus to undertake a major personal project, springing from ideas, writers, and artists studied in prior quarters, an excellent opportunity to complete substantive creative or research-oriented work, with guidance from program faculty and peer critique, and continuing French language study if desired.</p></description>

    <title>Feminist Epistemologies: Critical Approaches to Biology and Psychology</title>
    <minimum_credits>16</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>16</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>How is knowledge generated from a feminist theoretical perspective? Looking closely at the history of science and the construction of gender in biology, we will explore feminist interventions into knowledge production in these fields.</p><p>The history of women’s intellectual production and thought has long been silenced or suppressed by patriarchal structures, and to a great extent continues today through institutionalized sexism, androcentrism, and heteronormativity. This program will provide an opportunity for upper-level students familiar with mainstream methodologies within the natural sciences who wish to examine feminist critiques of such epistemologies and engage in research through a critical lens.</p><p>We will read feminist philosophy of science, sociological studies on science and how it operates in society, research on women scientists, and critical deconstructions of sociobiology and the related field of evolutionary psychology. Possible topics to be examined through feminist lenses are developmental biology, fertilization, reproduction, sex determination, sexuality, and gendered social norms. Possible authors include Emily Martin, Evelyn Fox Keller, Sandra Harding, Donna Haraway, Anne Fausto-Sterling, Stacy Alaimo, Cordelia Fine, Marlene Zuk and Karen Barad. Research will be conducted in the lab and in the field, which, for marine and developmental biology will include local marine field sites.</p></description>

    <title>Coming to Our Senses: Blessing the Space Between Us</title>
    <minimum_credits>16</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>16</maximum_credits>
    <description><p><em>
        Bless thou to me mine eye
        <br/>
        May mine eye bless all that it sees
        <br/>
        I will bless my neighbor
        <br/>
        May my neighbor bless me.
      </em><br/>
      -a Celtic prayer trans. A Carmichael
    </p><p>
      Often we feel we are individuals and the space between us and other individuals is empty, barren. But sometimes we say others give off a “vibe,” or that we have a “hunch” or an “intuition” about someone. We
      <em>sense</em>
      … something, something between us. Often though, we don’t trust our sensibilities and dismiss them as unreasonable or fanciful. In this program we will try to become sensible again — sensible to trust our senses, including our common sense, and approach them as a kind of knowledge not to be shrugged off as &quot;just a feeling.&quot; We’ll enlist some bright people to help us understand how our sensibilities transcend our bodies and apprehend the spaces between us: Aristotle on the senses and on true friendship, monastics on community, philosophers Martha Nussbaum and Harry Frankfurt on love, theologian Karen Armstrong who offers us a distinction between two kinds of knowing —
      <em>logos</em>
      (what we apprehend empirically) and
      <em>mythos</em>
      (what we perceive through our senses), anthropologists Kathryn Geurts and Rebecca Lester on the cultural origins of our sensibilities and the meaning we make of them, Irish poet John O’Donohue on
      <em>anam ċara</em>
      , a peculiarly Celtic form of friendship, Martin Buber on education and the change in sensibility that happens when we think not in terms of separate I and It but in terms of the unitary I-You. In what ways would we live our lives differently if we recognize and bless the space between us?

    <title>Bodies Speaking Out: Public Health and Community through the Lenses of Science, Ethnography, and Media</title>
    <minimum_credits>16</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>16</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>This program builds interdisciplinary knowledge and skills in public health, ethnography, documentary media production, history, cultural studies, and community-based research as a basis for collaborative work with community partners in the Pacific Northwest, particularly at the intersections of health, labor, and migration. How have people and communities come to understand and represent the complexity of their embodied experiences of health, including individual and collective well-being, sickness, disability, and healing? What conditions of inequity can jeopardize health, including jobs, schooling, housing and industrial exposures? What social networks, educational resources and medical practices have communities created to address their concerns? How can we—as students and practitioners of documentary media, ethnography, history, and public health—contribute to their ongoing efforts? At the core of these questions lies an ethics of engagement that places us in the role of listeners, collaborators, and facilitators, recasting more conventional relationships between researchers and subjects, adults and youth, health workers and patients, academics and community members.</p><p>Drawing from a range of cases in the U.S. and abroad, we will learn foundations of global health, occupational health, epidemiology, and critical medical anthropology. We will study archival research, oral history, and ethnography as techniques for understanding and documenting people’s everyday lives, exploring experimental and collaborative methods that give voice to stories of illness and healing. We will learn practices of documentary photography and possibly video and activist art to document community efforts, and support communities to create their own narratives of struggle. We’ll explore community-based research projects that have the potential to change the relationship between higher education and local community. We’ll explore the politics and ethics of representation in visual images, and investigate how our own images, produced collaboratively with community members, can challenge relations of power and privilege that have traditionally existed in mainstream media.</p><p>Central to these studies will be consideration of the economic and social conditions that contribute to community health and well-being. We’ll learn how structural inequalities of race, class, and gender (among others) shape exposure to harm and access to remediation. We’ll learn how struggles over housing, schooling, jobs and other social and economic conditions affect individual health and the collective health of communities. We will consider how infectious diseases, once easily treatable such as tuberculosis, have resurged in virulent drug-resistant forms under conditions of incarceration, substandard housing, and biomedical abandonment. We’ll learn how economies of production and exposure to carcinogens and other industrial toxics affect poor communities and communities of color disproportionately, mapping onto patterns of social, economic, and political marginalization. We’ll learn how immigrant laborers, including those in Washington State, face particular occupational hazards and limits to care, and follow what they are doing or hope to do to address these challenges. Finally, we will learn how struggling communities develop strategies of resistance, including alternative health care programs and schools, and documentary media campaigns. We will explore these critical facets of environmental justice and health inequities both locally and in Southeast Asia and Latin America. A key focus will be studying and engaging with efforts in our region—through field trips, ethnographies, public health research, films, historical and contemporary studies—and projects that explore research and collaboration with nearby communities.</p><p>Fall quarter will emphasize in-class studies and beginning community dialogues to create a foundation for our collaborative work winter quarter. We will explore case studies and models of community collaboration to inform our efforts, taking a two-night field trip to Mt. Vernon farming communities. While the fall quarter media component will focus on archives and documentary photography, in winter we might widen our studies of art and media practices to incorporate video documentary, activist art and recorded oral histories. We will also conduct urban studies in Portland centered on housing instability. We’ll embark on collaborative projects with community organizations to document, support, and augment their work. Possible projects include facilitating community photography (Photovoice), video documentary, collaborative ethnographic studies, performance, public health communications, and health policy advocacy. Spring quarter we will focus on writing, revision, photo/video editing, presentations, and completion of our collaborative projects.</p></description>

    <title>Biocultural Diversity Conservation in Peru</title>
    <minimum_credits>16</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>16</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>
      Peru offers a dynamic setting for students seeking a field-based program to study the opportunities and tensions in preserving biological and cultural diversity in the 21
      <sup>st</sup>
      century. Peru is recognized for its geographic and climatic extremes, biodiversity, cultural diversity, and knowledge systems that have been shaped over thousands of years by coastal deserts, temperate valleys, glaciated mountains, subtropical cloud forests, and Amazonia. Appreciating this diversity firsthand and experiencing the theory and practice of biocultural diversity conservation is the focus of this two-quarter program.
    </p><p>Winter quarter will begin on the Olympia campus by studying Peruvian geography, climate, cultures, and conquests that have driven the use of biodiversity and modification of local environments. While learning how to access and review scientific literature, we will examine trends and links between Peru’s changing land cover, biodiversity, climate, cultures and languages, traditional agricultural diversity, natural resource extraction, tourism industry, glaciers, and water supplies. Ecological and ethnographic field research methods and case studies will also be introduced. Halfway through winter quarter students will travel to Peru where we will visit cultural landscapes such as Lake Titicaca, Colca Canyon, Machu Picchu, and highland communities to learn how traditional knowledge is being combined with conservation science in initiatives to preserve biocultural diversity via national parks, community conservation areas, agricultural gene banks, ecotourism, and cultural tourism projects.</p><p>Studies in Peru will continue through spring break and spring quarter, with the majority of time in the Cusco region, from the highland Quechua communities’ International Potato Park to the subtropical Machu Picchu biocultural reserve. Students will experience remnant wildlands, Incan sites that modified topography and hydrology to increase productivity of diverse domesticated species, and Quechua communities that maintain immense agricultural diversity, medicinal plants and healing practices, and dye plants, sheep and alpaca for weaving. Field research practice will be gained through activities with traditional knowledge holders and field surveys of important species and habitats. Cultural understanding and Spanish or Quechua language learning will be supported with four weeks of language study, homestays, and faculty-led outings to biocultural diversity projects in local communities. During the last five weeks faculty will assist students to complete and present independent research projects integrating scientific literature and experience with a Peruvian project focused on conservation of wild and/or domesticated biodiversity and its associated cultural knowledge. The program in Peru will conclude with students free to return home, continue studying, or travel.</p></description>

    <title>Student-Originated Studies: Community-Based Learning and Action</title>
    <minimum_credits>16</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>16</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>This Student-Originated Studies program is intended for students with a general background and interest in social science, community life, public policy, social movements, and social justice. It is offered for students who are making (or have made) solid arrangements with community-based organizations or agencies to shape an internship or students who developed a plan for an independent study that involves community-based learning, organizing, research, and participation. Students will develop strong links to organizations, regional social movements, and community mentors and partners who will be the students guides and hosts in their work.</p><p>A combination of internship (or individual study) and academic credit will be awarded. Students may arrange for an internship for up to 30 hours a week. Typically, four to six academic credits will be awarded for seminar work on community-based studies, social science, and participatory action research. Students with less than 10 credits of internship may supplement their project with accompanying research, reading, and writing associated with their community work.</p><p>
      The program includes a required weekly program meeting that will focus on discussion of readings in social science, community studies, and participatory research. There will be other meetings as needed and in connection with community life and events. Students will be doing extensive writing, both as analysis of readings and as field-based logs and reflection. Students will organize small interest/support groups to discuss issues related to projects and to collaborate on a presentation at the end of the quarter. Students will submit weekly progress/reflection reports to the faculty sponsor. Contact faculty member Lin Nelson (
      <a href="mailto:nelsonl@evergreen.edu">nelsonl@evergreen.edu</a>
      ) if further information is needed.
    </p><p>The program is connected to Evergreen’s Center for Community-based Learning and Action (CCBLA) which supports learning about, engaging with, and contributing to community life in the region. As such, this program benefits from the rich resource library, staff, internship support, and workshops offered through the center.</p></description>

    <title>Botany: Plants, Fungi, and People</title>
    <minimum_credits>16</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>16</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>This program serves beginning to intermediate science students who are looking for an opportunity to expand their understanding of botany and challenge themselves. This one-quarter program allows students to learn introductory plant biology and mycology in an interdisciplinary format. Students will learn about plant and fungal anatomy, morphology, systematics, and ecological relationships. Lectures based on textbook readings supplement laboratory work. The learning community will explore how present form and function informs us about the ecology and evolution of major groups of plants and fungi. Students will get hands-on experience studying these organisms under microscopes and in the field. Students will also learn how to maintain a detailed and illustrated nature journal to develop basic plant identification skills of common Pacific Northwest vascular plant and fungal species.</p><p>In addition to laboratory and field work, this program investigates people&apos;s current and historical relationships with plants and fungi.  Through seminar texts, films, and lectures, students will examine plants through the lens of agriculture, forestry, herbology, and horticulture and will learn how fungal plant diseases have shaped history.  Weekly workshops will help students improve their ability to write thesis-driven essays defended with evidence from assigned texts.</p></description>

    <title>Race, Gender, and Representation in Documentary Film</title>
    <minimum_credits>16</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>16</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>How do documentaries tell stories? How do they tell the truth? Why do we believe in the truth that they tell?</p><p>Our study of the theory and practice of documentary will focus on how construction of documentary “truth” can be a double-edged sword for people marginalized by race, gender, and other markers of difference. We will examine ways that documentaries can exploit, exalt, or support their subjects, consider the role of ethics in documentary film practice, and pay careful attention to the responsibilities that documentary film directors have to the communities that they represent. Our examination will include careful attention to the formal tools used in documentary filmmaking, while placing documentary films into broader social and historical context. We will consider limits and possibilities of representing race and gender on screen by considering the power the documentarians hold, and the critical importance of wielding that power with thought and care.</p><p>In this introductory program, students will learn to use a variety of creative and critical strategies to make documentaries, including video production, video editing, and documentary writing/scripting techniques. Students will read historical and theoretical texts about documentary film, and screen a wide variety of films from the U.S. and abroad. Class work will include weekly seminar papers and screening exercises, analytical essays, research projects, video, audio and editing workshops, observation assignments, and micro-documentary projects.</p><p>This program is designed to be an introduction to Evergreen media studies. It is ideal for those interested in pursuing yearlong media programs in the future, as well as for those wishing to integrate media into a broad liberal arts curriculum.</p></description>

    <description><p>This program will develop and interrelate concepts in laboratory biology, organic chemistry, and biochemistry, thus providing a foundation for students who plan to continue studies in chemistry, laboratory biology, field biology, and medicine. In a yearlong sequence, students will carry out upper-division work in genetics, organic chemistry, biochemistry, cellular and molecular biology, developmental biology, and physiology.</p><p>The program will examine the subject matter through the central idea that structure defines function, integrating a scaled theme from the organismal to the cellular to the molecular level. As the year progresses, the scaled theme will continue through studies of cellular and biochemical processes in biological systems. We will examine organic chemistry, the nature of organic compounds and reactions, and carry this work into biochemistry and the fundamental chemical reactions of living systems. Biological concepts of inheritance will be covered through the study of Mendelian and population genetics, leading to an understanding from a molecular DNA perspective. Building on these fundamental processes, we will study how multicellular organisms develop.</p><p>The program will contain a significant laboratory component. Students will write papers and maintain laboratory notebooks weekly. All laboratory work and approximately half of non-lecture time will be spent working in collaborative problem-solving groups. In spring quarter more in-depth laboratory and library research projects will be a culmination of all major concepts learned throughout the year.</p><p>This is an intensive program. The subjects are complex and the sophisticated understanding we expect to develop will require devoted attention and many hours of scheduled lab work each week. </p></description>

    <title>Freshwater Ecology: A Landscape Perspective</title>
    <minimum_credits>16</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>16</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>Rivers flow through complex landscapes in which upland and riparian elements interact in complex ways. In this program, we will take a landscape perspective to understanding these interactions. We will investigate the impacts of how local geology, land-use practices (logging, urbanization, agriculture), and terrestrial disturbances (forest fires, landslides, insect outbreaks) influence the chemistry and hydrodynamics of river water.</p><p>Rivers and streams rank as some of the most imperiled ecosystems on Earth. They have been heavily impacted by transportation, irrigation, energy production, waste disposal and recreation. Due to high extinction rates of freshwater species, it is crucial to understand how freshwater ecosystems function and habitats can be restored. We will study freshwater ecology and landscape ecology concepts in order to understand spatial patterns and connectivity so we may consider restoration and management paradigms in rivers today.</p><p>We will conduct field studies, lectures and labs addressing broad landscape patterns and processes in watersheds and water bodies. Students will learn to make scientific observations, ask research questions, design field experiments, collect and analyze data, run statistical analyses, analyze spatial patterns, make maps, and communicate their findings using scientific writing, oral presentations, and lay summaries. Seminar readings will focus on human-freshwater interactions and local topics in the Pacific Northwest.</p></description>

    <maximum_credits>16</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>Are you curious about the origins of dance and how they relate to classical ballet? In this program we will interrogate class, gender, and race through the philosophical and historical aspects of classical ballet. We will give much attention to the development of the individual co-learner to promote confidence and creativity emanating from the body in an atmosphere that facilitates such development. Students will be encouraged to learn through personal discovery as the most effective route to rapid technical change and unique creative expression. As a result, dancers should be sound in both mind and body with a sense of wonder about the world and the intellectual curiosity to explore the place of their art within that world.</p><p>This program offers a discursive observation of the role and function of classical ballet as the mirror, or shadow, of society. Ballet is directly tied to the world in which it is created but also transcends time and space in reverberation and relevancy. From its inception ballet has provided metaphors and symbols for cultural reflection. We will probe into the theory and history of ballet, primarily in the Western world, to familiarize ourselves with these symbolic, psychological, and cultural functions of this genre of dance. We will research and explore the historical underpinnings of dance and classical ballet to the present day to interrogate and find our places within the discipline of dance as a means to promote and facilitate one’s ultimate creative voice and expression. Students will take ballet workshops, learn French terminology, and collaborate on final projects relative to the subject matter and period of dance they choose to choreograph.</p></description>

    <title>Dancing Molecules, Dancing Bodies</title>
    <minimum_credits>16</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>16</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>Our bodies are always moving. Even when you are sitting absolutely still, there is movement throughout your body — the pumping of your heart, the flow of blood through your blood vessels, and a continuous vibration of the molecules that make up your body. In this program we will explore dance from the perspectives of culture, physiology, and introductory chemistry. We will explore properties in chemistry connected to movement (conductivity, molecular vibrations, energy, reactivity, and solubility) and study how chemicals both construct and move within the human body. Students will become in tune with their bodies through movement and dance workshops and scientific studies of the anatomy and physiology of the human body. We will examine and perform dance, not simply within categories like ballet or modern, but from a broader perspective of movement and culture.</p><p>Winter quarter we will begin to examine the molecular, anatomical, and physiological basis of dance and other demanding activities. Through labs and lectures we will gain an understanding of how these systems function to allow us to do anything from walking across the street to performing the complex movements of dance. Concepts from introductory biology will be reinforced in dance workshops and students will be encouraged to learn through paying attention to what is happening in their own bodies. Students will begin to develop an understanding of the dance community and how it fits into a larger social and community context. Some time will also be spent unpacking issues of privilege, stereotypes, and accessibility in the fields of dance, chemistry, and biology.</p><p>This model of the culture of dance will continue to be refined in spring through readings and other texts, including film and performances. We will continue to explore the physiology and molecular biology behind dance and discuss nutrition in the context of exercise physiology and dance. We will also explore the idea of dance in other animals. Spring quarter students will work on a group project that brings together various threads of the program and which will culminate in a final presentation and performance.</p><p>We will explore these topics through seminar assignments, exams and quizzes, reflective writing, laboratory experiments, movement workshops, and a group choreography assignment. No previous experience in dance, biology, or chemistry is required.</p></description>

    <title>Vertebrate Evolution</title>
    <minimum_credits>16</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>16</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>Evolution provides an explanation for the extraordinary biological diversity on this planet. In this program we will focus on macroevolutionary processes, specifically speciation and the evidence it leaves behind. In doing so, we will address several philosophical questions, including: How do we make claims of knowledge in an historical science such as evolution? We will investigate questions that may seem simple at first—what is a species?—but turn out to have myriad, conflicting answers. This complexity, and our attempts to discern the pattern in that complexity, will be our focus.</p><p>We will use vertebrates as our model with which to study evolution, reviewing the morphological history and diversity of this clade. Innovations have marked the history of vertebrates, including the origins of cartilage, bone, brains, endothermy, and the amniotic egg, which allowed for the invasion of terrestrial habitats. The transformation of existing structures to take on new functions has been another notable feature of vertebrate evolution from lungs into swim bladders, hands into wings, and scales into both feathers and hair.</p><p>Classroom work will include workshops and lectures in which active participation by all students will facilitate an enriching learning community. In weekly wet labs, we will study the comparative anatomy of vertebrate skulls and skeletons, and dissect cats and sharks. In the computer lab, we will use software designed for systematic character analysis, and students will generate and analyze morphological datasets.</p></description>

    <title>Life Writes Beautiful Stories: Growing-up Experiences in Literature, Script Writing, and Performance</title>
    <minimum_credits>16</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>16</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>This program is about creative expressions of the universal experience of growing up. It’s about how authors, performers, and other artists, including you, represent the personal process of a life unfolding in time and place. This brings into play the conditions of memory, experience, community, and culture that shape the act of growing up. From a classical-mythological perspective, the story of Persephone represents individual transformations that take place in a life, while contemporary writers, such as David Sedaris, Lynda Barry, and Bill Bryson, make sense of the human experience in evocative, emotional, and humorous ways.</p><p>In this program, students will explore the dynamic unfolding of life by reading and writing stories, viewing films and observing how that medium portrays lives over time, and composing and acting out scripts crafted from students&apos; own life stories. Growing up, as a universal experience, might be perceived as a pattern or a set of stages that elucidate the human experience. Movement workshops and theater performance workshops allow program participants to explore these patterns and stages.</p><p>This program is designed for students who are curious about the process of growing up and are eager to read, write, create, and perform in serious ways in order to act on that curiosity. Students in this program will work in groups and must collaborate, support, and encourage the bold act of inquiring about the personal experience of growing up. At the end of the quarter, a theatrical presentation of these stories will summarize the experience.</p></description>

    <title>Reality Check: Indian Images and [Mis]Representations</title>
    <minimum_credits>16</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>16</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>This program will address historic and contemporary images and misrepresentations of Indians in a variety of media. Indian images from films, photographs, language, mascots, popular culture, and commercial interests will be deconstructed and analyzed for meaning, significance, power, representation, and issues of authenticity. Colonialism, U.S./Indian history, geopolitics, and economics will be decolonized through the lenses of Native resistance, Native sovereignty, and Native political and economic issues. Essential to this exploration will be an investigation of the dynamics of &quot;self&quot; and &quot;other.&quot;</p><p>Learning will take place through readings, seminars, lectures, films, and workshops. Students will improve their research skills through document review, observations, and critical analysis. Students will also have opportunities to improve their writing skills through weekly written assignments. Verbal skills will be improved through small-group and whole-class seminar discussions, and through individual final project presentations. Options for the final project will be discussed in the syllabus and in class.</p></description>

    <title>Illustrations of Character:  A Literary and Philosophical Inquiry</title>
    <minimum_credits>16</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>16</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>How do we determine what to do when faced with hard choices? Is happiness uppermost in our minds, or can something else guide us, such as loyalty to a friend, religious principle, or political commitment? What if the right decision goes against our sense of self? How can we live with integrity in the face of temptation or tragedy? How do historical, political, and social contexts shape how we think and act in such situations? Can we really have free will when context limits how we understand, feel, and imagine our circumstances and how to change them?</p><p>These ethical questions demand that we think carefully about character. Character comprises not only distinctive individual qualities, but also the disposition to act in certain ways. Character can also refer to collective identifiers such as ethnicity, sex, gender, class, race, religion, region, and nation. These markers can both inspire intractable conflicts and frame claims to justice. We will study works of philosophy, history, drama, and fiction that illuminate our understanding of character. We’ll explore how character affects, and is affected by, desire, deliberation, action, and suffering. We’ll read literary and historical accounts that illustrate the character of people or a people and portray profound moral dilemmas. Works of ethics will broaden how we think about character in relation to external goods, habit, happiness, friendship, and duties. They provide powerful interpretive tools and a refined vocabulary for grappling with questions raised by our texts.</p><p>Fall quarter will focus on Aristotelian ethics. We’ll learn how the ancient Greeks understood the challenges of their experiment with democracy and consider their efforts to attune desire to responsibility, friendship to self-interest, and deliberation to action. We’ll read retellings of their myths, dramas, and epic poetry to consider how their concerns resonate in our own times. Authors will include Plato, Aristotle, Sophocles, Toni Morrison, and Walt Whitman. In winter we will learn how Immanuel Kant’s moral philosophy provided new tools for the critical analysis of age-old social practices such as slavery, gender domination, and economic inequality. We will also consider the perpetual challenges of maintaining hope and faith in the face of persistent injustices.</p><p>This program is suitable for students who are prepared not only to think critically, but to investigate their own beliefs and submit them to rigorous scrutiny, to practice ethical thinking as well as study it. Writing will be central to that practice. Students will practice analytical, creative, and critical writing, and learn how to both give and receive constructive criticism. We look forward to a thriving community focused on studying, puzzling over, understanding, and celebrating character—an abiding challenge of the human condition.</p><p><strong>Note: a version of this program will repeat in spring quarter.  Students who take the fall-winter program should not take the spring program.</strong></p></description>

    <title>Student-Originated Studies: Psychology</title>
    <minimum_credits>12, 16</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>12, 16</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>This Student-Originated Studies (SOS) is an opportunity for students to do intermediate to advanced work in psychology. Students will work independently on their own individual projects or areas of study. Areas of study may include prerequisites for graduate work, internships, or empirical research projects. Students are encouraged to cluster together around projects that reflect their shared interests. Students will meet in a forum in which they will share work-in-progress to get feedback and advice. The forum is intended to provide a sense of community and support to students.</p><p>All students will develop a plan for 12 or 16 credits that includes any combination of individual study, faculty-provided study, or an in-program internship. Students are encouraged to reserve four or eight of their credits for faculty-provided components.  Carrie Margolin will lead a four-credit seminar on Cognitive Neuroscience. This seminar will involve reading and discussing seminar books, making online postings, and writing one paper. Bill Indick will offer a four-credit option in Developmental Psychology. This option will involve attending lectures; reading a textbook; and a choice of either writing a term paper, doing a presentation, or doing the publisher-provided &quot;Learning Curve&quot; tests for their assignments.</p><p>Students planning to study one or more standard or prerequisite area(s) of psychology,such as Human Sexuality or Social Psychology, will use self-selected recent academic textbooks to guide their study. Students planning to study either Theories of Personality or Abnormal Psychology will read a faculty-chosen textbook and will have a choice of either writing a term paper, doing a presentation, or doing the publisher-provided &quot;Learning Curve&quot; tests (for Abnormal Psychology only).</p><p>Students will demonstrate their learning through a variety of ways, including online tools (publisher-provided exams or study guides), chapter outlines, writing a paper, etc. Students proposing empirical research for an option will be guided through the research process with the goal of presenting their research at the Western Psychological Association Convention in Sacramento, CA in Spring 2017.</p></description>

    <description><p>This year-long program is a rigorous introduction to knowledge and skills students need to continue their studies in physics, chemistry, mathematics, and the natural sciences. We will cover key concepts in university-level physics, general chemistry, and calculus.</p><p>Modern science has been remarkably successful in providing understanding of how natural systems behave. Such disparate phenomena as the workings of cell phones, the ways in which we detect super-massive black holes in the galactic core, use of magnetic resonance imaging in diagnosis of disease, the effects of global carbon dioxide levels on shellfish growth, and design of batteries for electric cars are all linked at a deeply fundamental level. This program will introduce you to the theory and practice of the science behind these and other phenomena while providing the solid academic background in mathematics, chemistry, and physics necessary for advanced study in those fields, as well as for engineering, medicine, and biology.</p><p>There will be a strong laboratory focus during which we will explore the nature of chemical and physical systems in a highly collaborative environment. The key to success in the program will depend on commitment to work, learning, and collaboration. The work will be intensive and challenging, but the material exciting. Students should expect to spend at least 50 hours a week engaged with assignments and material during and outside of class. During fall, we will focus on skill-building in the laboratory and acquiring the basic tools in chemistry, physics, and calculus. By winter quarter students will increase their ability to integrate disciplines, moving between established models and experimental data to ask and seek answers to their own questions. A spring quarter component will be a library or laboratory research project and presentation of findings to the public, allowing students to share their knowledge with a broad audience.</p></description>

    <description><p>Symbiosis can be defined as the living together of differently named organisms. This program will look at the biology of symbiotic associations through lectures, readings, laboratory, field work, and seminar topics taken from primary literature. Although particular attention will be paid to mutualistic symbioses, parasitic associations will also be covered. Defining aspects of plant-animal, fungi-plant, animal-animal, bacteria-plant, bacteria-animal, and protozoa-animal symbioses will be examined at the organismal, physiological, cellular, biochemical, molecular, and ecological levels. Characteristics that define integration between host and symbiont of specific associations will be investigated through fieldwork and experimental laboratory sessions. Students will complete a take-home examination, keep a lab notebook, and develop and carry out a research project that culminates in a poster and oral presentation.</p></description>

    <title>Borderlands of the Novel</title>
    <minimum_credits>16</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>16</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>How do we tell stories? Why do we tell stories? Is there a bright line between telling stories and telling the truth? And how has the novel in particular adapted itself to our ways of storytelling? In this one-quarter program, we intend to read examples of experimental or genre-bending novels from the pre-modern to the post-modern, along with examples of narrative nonfiction that stand as literary art. Works by writers such as Defoe, Diderot, Sterne, Melville, Agee, Barnes, Calvino, Muñoz, Didion, Paley, Sebald, and Wallace will form the backbone of our studies, which will cluster around British and American literature. Of particular interest will be those novels in which fiction masquerades as fact, those in which fact is disguised in fiction, and nonfiction which relies on imagination to get at truth. We will also read some shorter pieces of philosophy, folklore, literature, journalism, theory, and more to supplement our studies. The program involves in-depth reading, discussion, and writing about these literary works. Students will also be able to write their own stories of experience in response to our books, with guidance from faculty about skills of listening, observing, and literary craft.</p></description>

    <title>Groundwork: Senior Thesis in the Humanities</title>
    <minimum_credits>16</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>16</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>What is the value of capstone work, a senior thesis, or an independent project? How does one conduct this work in the humanities? How does one prepare for such a project? This program is designed for juniors and seniors who are hoping to pursue a capstone project in the humanities or an interdisciplinary project with a strong foothold in the humanities. Capstone work—usually a long, independent project or senior thesis—is a common way of consolidating your undergraduate learning. This program will help you prepare the groundwork for your project, which will be undertaken in a subsequent quarter to be determined by the student. You will also be introduced to a number of faculty who may very well supervise your project.</p><p>There will be two broad elements in the program: The first is to develop a prospectus and introduction to your own project. The second is to engage with a number of contemporary ideas and texts across the humanities, with a strong focus on critical theory. You should expect to read this theory with an eye to real-world issues that arise from week to week. Students can expect to prepare the groundwork for their capstone work in a future quarter by developing a prospectus, reading list, annotated bibliography, and introductory drafts. We will look at disciplinary trends in the humanities, talk with faculty members here at Evergreen and elsewhere, and discuss graduate school. Lectures, seminars, and regular writing assignments will help hone our skills for capstone work. Students will also have the opportunity to help set some curriculum for upcoming lectures in the Critical and Cultural Theory lecture series.</p></description>

    <description><p>This is an intensive visual arts program for students who have a good background in representational drawing, who are passionate about the natural world, and who are eager to learn more about it. How have past artists, philosophers, and scientists understood and depicted the physical world? How are contemporary artists reinterpreting and reshaping our fundamental relationship to the environment and to other species? What is the role of the artist in a time of environmental crisis? Through readings, lectures, seminars, and intensive studio work, we will examine these questions. Individually, we will take the approach of artist/naturalists and delve deeply into an exploration of one or more species, ecosystems, or natural processes that intrigue us. Program activities will include skill workshops in painting (watercolor, gouache, and acrylics) and scientific illustration, lectures, seminars, individual research, and thematic studio work. Each student will create a body of images that expresses his/her research into and personal vision of an aspect of nature.</p><p>In the first weeks of the quarter each student will present a proposal for an in-depth, individual field study of a site, organism, natural process, or system. During week six, each student will conduct a field study at a site either on- or off-campus in the U.S. In week eight, students will present their field research and creative work to the program. </p><p>Students will need to commit at least 40 hours per week to their program work and must be willing to work in close quarters in the studio on campus. Students will be asked to regularly present work and to engage in critical assessment, dialog, research, and writing. </p></description>

    <title>Critical Thought and Social Consciousness Through Film</title>
    <minimum_credits>16</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>16</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>This introductory program uses film that revolves around complex issues found in society and that may offer different perspectives on human and societal behavior. Students will view and analyze popular and documentary films that include the topical areas of race relations, corporate influence and impacts, LGBTQ community issues, gender study, and student selected topics. Films may include: Crash, Milk, American History X, Wall Street, Grand Torino, Blackfish, Traffic, Missrepresentation, and How to Survive a Plague. Students will review critiques of the films, participate in seminars, use organizing techniques to identify concepts, review competing and historical perspectives, and study foundational books. In addition, students will begin to understand the roots of social and activist movements. Students will produce reflections, comparative analyses, a substantial research paper on the topic of their choice, deep reflective questions regarding the films, and research work associated with each film category. Students will produce a short introductory film within the framework of their research topic. They will understand the meaning of social consciousness and the value of significant dialogue. Students should be prepared to enter into difficult discussions with civility and respect and are expected to critically examine their own beliefs in light of differing perspectives. Students have the opportunity to earn credit in political science, critical thought, social consciousness, media studies, or social justice.  </p><p><strong>NOTE</strong>
      : students in this program 
      <strong>must</strong>
       be prepared to view films that offer controversial, uncomfortable, emotional or trigger subject matter, and may be rated R. Students need to be able to access assigned films on sites such as Netflix or Amazon.

    <minimum_credits>16</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>16</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>This program focuses on learning the identity and evolutionary relationships of marine organisms. Marine environments support an extremely diverse group of autotrophic and heterotrophic organisms, which together comprise an important fraction of Earth’s biodiversity. The proximity of Evergreen&apos;s campus to various marine habitats provides excellent opportunities to study many diverse groups of organisms. Emphasis will be placed on learning the regional marine flora and fauna. Students will learn fundamental laboratory and field techniques and will be required to complete a research project utilizing the available microscopy facilities (light and scanning electron microscopes). Workshops on the statistical analysis of biodiversity will provide a quantitative aspect to our work. This program will include extensive work in both the lab and field.</p></description>

    <title>Psychology and Mindfulness</title>
    <minimum_credits>4, 16</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>4, 16</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>Mindfulness is the ability to fully attend to what is at hand and be in the present moment. Mindfulness is being applied to a variety of professional fields, including health care and education, to improve effectiveness and enhance well-being. The practice of mindfulness can increase our individual and collective resiliency to respond to changing personal and global situations in adaptive and creative ways. The program will focus on mindfulness through theory, practice and its application in relation to abnormal psychology and clinical healthcare practice. We will explore such questions as how mindfulness can be applied to mental and physical health.</p><p>The four-credit module (weekend only) will focus on clinical applications of mindfulness. Mindfulness will be explored through theoretical, applied and expressive arts projects. In addition, students in enrolled in the sixteen-credit module (week days and weekend) will also look at how these dimensions of mindfulness interface with developmental and abnormal psychology. Sixteen-credit students will study abnormal psychology and see how mindfulness is being integrated into the treatment of mental illness, pain, addictions, hypertension, and other health conditions. Students will also study quantitative reasoning skills for social sciences.</p><p>Students will have an opportunity to learn in many ways using diverse modalities and multiple intelligences. We will integrate mindfulness practices into our studies, including movement, integrative health practices, and expressive art workshops (no prior experience necessary). We will participate in community readings, rigorous writing assignments, theoretical tests, and critical study of important texts. The program will include a full day mindfulness retreat.</p></description>

    <title>Northwest Spaces: Urban Planning and Native American Studies</title>
    <minimum_credits>16</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>16</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>Who is involved in the planning of Northwest spaces — urban, suburban, rural, tribal? In what ways do Native people make urban places their own? Our program will explore links between Northwest places, urban planning, and Native American and indigenous peoples, framing our discussion around themes of environmental and economic sustainability, social justice and education, and popular culture. Diverse concepts of &quot;native&quot; will be examined, involving not only people but also native landscapes and species. We will broadly consider theories of space, place, mobility, and identity in our discussions of public/private/tribal spaces.</p><p>We will consider perceptions, realities, and shared experiences of Native, non-Native, and recent immigrants in Northwest places using the lenses of history, urban studies, public policy, and cultural studies. We will look at alliances in areas such as environmental restoration projects, contemporary art, economic development, and local governance.</p><p>During fall and winter quarters we will examine forces of urbanization and suburbanization and how Native life and landscapes changed as a result. Attention will be paid to both immediately apparent and curiously intertwined events and periods in history such as Native displacement, industrialization, world&apos;s fairs, the rise of urban planning, tourism, and the arts. Changes in the political life of Native groups will be addressed through a study of legislation and legal cases, tribal casinos, economic development, environmental justice, and contemporary art. We will question and frame competing public narratives, particularly how Native people are portrayed in museum environments, case studies, films, and texts.</p><p>From mid-winter to mid-spring, the program will continue to deepen its exploration of these issues. Students will have the opportunity to engage in advanced research projects or internships. Program workshops throughout the year will develop skills, such as in demographic analysis using the U.S. Census, community development, revenue sources, policy research and writing, film critique, interviewing, and oral history. Students will use these skills to become stronger writers and researchers, and importantly, community members. We will require extensive reading and writing on these topics, and students will assist in the facilitation of weekly seminars. Guest presenters, documentary films, museum exhibits, and field trips to tribal museums and urban community organizations will support our analysis throughout the year.</p></description>

    <description><p>Would you like to better understand the numerical side of business? This program will provide the quantitative reasoning for much of the conduct and understanding of business and finance in today’s world. We will focus on contemporary business issues, as well as offer an introduction to personal finance and investing. This program also includes four credits of basic undergraduate statistics that will serve as a foundation for further work in advanced social sciences, including graduate programs requiring statistics, such as MBA or MPA.</p><p>
      We will examine the financial challenges faced by smaller businesses, entrepreneurs and individuals, and what it takes to be effective in our current economic environment. There will be workshops, lectures, films, guest speakers, and student-led sessions. Readings from daily newspapers such as the
      <em>Wall Street Journal</em>
      , magazines such as the
      <em>Economist</em>
      and
      <em>Kiplinger</em>
      , and texts such as
      <em>That Used to Be Us</em>
      by Thomas Friedman will increase student familiarity with current business topics and help students develop the skills to organize and analyze business, economic, and financial information. Strategies for effectively presenting quantitative information will also be covered.

      This program offers students the chance to study Shakespeare&apos;s playscripts as trace records of early modern theatrical productions and as springboards for contemporary ones. Students will read a small number of plays -- including
      <em>Hamlet</em>
      ,
      <em>Macbeth</em>
      , and
      <em>King Lear</em>
      -- and analyze multiple 20th- and 21st-century adaptations; reading materials will be supplemented by lectures with a focus on performance history. Our analysis will be informed by a study of the works&apos; formal elements, but also by ideological considerations. We will ask questions such as: What kinds of cultural values are emphasized or de-emphasized in these adaptations? What difference does casting make, including cross-casting along the lines of gender or race? All students will be expected to engage thoughtfully in discussions of systematic oppression.  Students will demonstrate their interpretative and analytical skills through regular critical writing assignments. They will also be given the opportunity to design a final project, based in part on their previous training and academic work. This project may focus on creative writing, live performance, and/or critical writing. A background in literature and/or performance is not necessary to succeed in this program, but advanced students will be given opportunities to stretch their skills.

    <description><p>
      During this year-long program, we will cultivate a sense of wonder as we explore our place in the universe. Through a study of astronomy and cosmology, science and story, intellect and imagination, we will develop tools to understand the nature of our world—from human through astronomical scales—as we study critical and creative models of thinking in the sciences and humanities, including language, literature, myth, history, philosophy, mathematics, sustainability, education, and the arts
      <em>.</em>
       How do diverse cultures and disciplines express a relationship to the cosmos as they ask foundational questions: “Who are we?” “Why are we here?” and “What difference does it make?”
    </p><p>As we follow the historic development of astronomical ideas--from prehistory to contemporary cosmological theories—we will consider scientific, literary, mythological, alchemical, and ecological systems of thought that reveal cycles of transformation and change. Through embracing the tools of science and story, we will deepen our understanding about the evolution of the cosmos, life on earth, and the evolutionary and ecological challenges of sustainability that face the world today.</p><p>Through workshops and observations, participants will combine theory and practice as they analyze various models.  They will make quantitative inquiries into the nature and origin of physical phenomena as they explore various narratives about the natural world.  They will develop critical and creative writing skills, along with the ability to analyze diverse poetic, literary, cultural, and philosophic texts and traditions.</p><p>Over the year, students will learn to use binoculars and telescopes to do field-studies and identify stars, planets, constellations, and other astronomical phenomena. We will take field trips to a planetarium, science center, or observatory.  Students will use virtual technologies and software to simulate the night sky, navigate star charts, and plan stargazing explorations.</p><p>There are no science prerequisites to enter this program. We will develop all scientific topics from the ground up. By the end of the program students will precisely describe and explain the motion of objects in the solar system, stellar evolution, the creation of the building blocks of the material world, modern theories of the origin of the universe, and the connection between science, wisdom, sustainability, and the future.</p><p> </p><p>Fall: Celestial Motions</p><p>In the fall, we will explore celestial motions. We will ask, what is the relationship between earth and sky, time and space? We will look at different calendars and explore cycles and seasons; we will learn about the ecliptic, fixed stars, the zodiac, solar and lunar motion, and how and when eclipses occur. We will study classic and cross-cultural star lore, literature and essays that explore the human connection between earth and sky, and investigate ancient cultures and archeo-astronomy.  Students will tell star stories and create their own star maps based on qualitative and quantitative information. Students will work in teams to do research and create virtual planetarium programs or other projects.</p><p> </p><p>Winter: Stellar Evolution and Transformation</p><p>In the winter, we will deepen our understanding of cosmology as we learn about stellar and solar evolution, cosmic cycles of transformation and change, and the building blocks of the cosmos.  We will investigate the history of scientific thought, medieval alchemical traditions, and solar cosmologies from the Salish Star Child myth to ancient Vedas.  Students will read and write poetic and fictional works related to astronomy, complete a research project and paper, and will create an artistic project, such as a Cornell Box, based on the alchemical symbols and art, or other course themes.</p><p> </p><p>Spring: Big Bang--Science, Wisdom, and The Future</p><p>In the spring we will deepen our understanding through exploring theories about relativity, the Big Bang, cosmic evolution, life on earth, the search for extraterrestrial life, and other cosmic quandaries.   We will study creation stories and myths, and a variety of writers exploring the relationship between science, wisdom, and the future.  Bringing our studies back to earth, and evolutionary processes, we will study sustainability and global warming from both a planetary and ethical point of view, connecting astronomy to cultural, ecological, and social justice issues. Students will develop educational or research projects that they can present at Science Circus, or other public venues.  They will continue to develop their star-finding skills, after class in the evenings, and will learn to give public star hunts and presentations about the upcoming eclipse in the summer of 2017. </p><p> </p><p> </p></description>

    <title>Power Play(ers): Actions and Their Consequences</title>
    <minimum_credits>16</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>16</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>This program will explore colonial, postcolonial, and neocolonial issues as they are unfolding on local, national, and global stages. Colonialism has resurfaced in new forms of neocolonialism that we encounter in our daily lives and work. We will place emphasis on how individuals and groups acquire mental resistance, how to assert individual, family, and community values and identities, and how to decipher and reframe meanings from information channeled through mass media. This also includes analyzing the powers at play in societal structures, how to empower oneself and community, and how to understand the ways in which these structures of power and control impact the quality of life for ordinary people at home and abroad. These are some of the skills students will learn from Power Play(ers).</p><p>This upper-division program will examine local, national, and international policy issues of the postcolonial and neocolonial world in education, health care, social welfare, and the environment through interdisciplinary studies of law, biology, public health, environmental studies, the legislative process, mathematics modeling, sociology, psychology, American and world history, media literacy, and world literature and cultures. Research methods in social and natural sciences and statistics emphasized in this program will present students with a systematic approach and analytical tools to address real-life issues in research practice throughout the activities of the program.</p><p>
      The theme for fall quarter is
      <em>identifying the problem and clarifying the question</em><em>.</em>
      The first quarter of the program will be used to lay the foundation for the rest of the year, both substantively and in terms of tools necessary to operate effectively in the learning community. We will explore theories, history, and practices of colonialism. Colonialism will be analyzed from the perspectives of both political economy and history. In seminars we will read, discuss, and analyze texts that will add to our understanding of the ways in which colonialism and neocolonialism have created unequal distributions of power, wealth, and access to resources.
    </p><p>
      Winter quarter&apos;s theme is
      <em>researching roots, causes, and potential solutions</em>
      . We will look at specific contemporary issues of power viewed from a variety of institutional perspectives, most notably in health, education, law, science, government, politics, youth, environment, community development, women&apos;s empowerment, and human rights. Students will investigate specific issues of unequal distributions of power with the purpose of identifying a particular problem, defining its dimensions, determining its causes, and establishing action plans for its remedy.
    </p><p>
      In spring the theme will progress to
      <em>implementation.</em>
      The program will devote the final quarter to the design and implementation of projects to address issues of unequal distributions of power identified in winter quarter. Seminar groups will combine their efforts to undertake actions to target current imbalances of power in the community. These actions may take the form of educational events, publications, multimedia presentations, or art installations. Academic courses will assist in the successful implementation and evaluation of the student group activities.

    <title>"All the Things You Are:" Jazz and American Culture</title>
    <minimum_credits>16</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>16</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>What is jazz? Where did it come from? Where is it going? This program will provide an introduction to jazz music, an overview of its history, and an assessment of its impact on American culture. Students will explore the musical elements of jazz and its aesthetic, cultural, and historical roots. Jazz can refer to a variety of styles of composition, improvisation and performance, including New Orleans, swing, bebop, cool, and avant-garde. The music, its players, and its history have helped to shape American culture as a whole. Previous musical background is not required, but a willingness to listen patiently, carefully, and critically will enable students to feel and appreciate what scholar Robert G. O&apos;Meally has called &quot;the jazz cadence of American culture.&quot;</p><p>
      Our primary text will be
      <em>The Oxford Companion to Jazz,</em>
      edited by Bill Kirchner. Additional books and articles will include biographies and autobiographies, fiction, poetry (including music lyrics), and scholarly articles on jazz. Weekly film screenings will include a range of fiction works and documentaries such as Ken Burns’s critically acclaimed series
      <em>Jazz</em>
      . Finally, there will be extensive (and enjoyable!) listening assignments that will provide the soundtrack for our journey from Africa to the southern United States, to the urban North, throughout the nation, and across the globe.
    </p><p>We will devote two weekly seminars to close readings of written texts, film, and music. In addition to short weekly writing assignments, students will produce a final project that will help them refine both their expository and creative nonfiction writing skills. There will be a weekly in-house opportunity for musicians—whether aspiring or experienced—to play and share jazz, as well as a field trip to a major Pacific Northwest jazz festival.</p></description>

    <title>Student-Originated Studies: Poetics and Creative Writing</title>
    <minimum_credits>12, 16</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>12, 16</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>Poetics involves language as creative functions (writing, poetry, fiction), language as performance, language as image, and language as a tool of thought (philosophy, criticism). Our work will be to calibrate these various activities, which is to say find the relationships between poetic and critical thought.</p><p>Students are invited to join a learning community of culture workers interested in language as a medium of artistic production. This SOS is designed for students who share similar skills and common interests in doing advanced work in creative writing that may have grown out of previous academic projects and/or programs. Students will work with faculty throughout the program to design small study groups, collaborative projects, and critique groups that will allow students to support each other&apos;s work.</p></description>

    <title>Sport: Personal Engagement and Corporate Fanaticism</title>
    <minimum_credits>16</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>16</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>This program explores the role that sport plays in North American culture. It contributes to identity formation and personal development as well as learning values about work, play, entertainment, and family. Sport reflects our society’s contestation surrounding race, class, cis- and trans-gender, and sexual orientation.</p><p>We examine sport from multiple perspectives and genres. Through a close reading of sports media, including stories, poetry, film, and journalism, we explore the following questions: How does sport fit into social life? How does sport participation teach social and cultural norms? How does sport reflect class relations? How does the profit motive distort sport and sport experiences? How are power relations reproduced and/or resisted in and through sports? Whose voices are/are not represented in the narratives and images that constitute sports? How are sports gendered activities, and how do they reproduce dominant ideas about gender in society?</p><p>Above all, sport offers a way to engage larger social issues. Sport personifies the American Dream through stories of sport champions, both in their accomplishments and in the barriers that they overcome. Sports champions and sports teams also produced sports fans, fanatical loyalists to those athletes and teams they cherish.</p><p>The primary objective in the program is to develop a greater understanding of sport in social and cultural contexts. Students will write personal narrative and critical analysis, and present independent library research on a particular sport topic. In addition, on selected Friday afternoons we will play sports together in an intramural, friendly competitive environment in order to reflect on our experiences in relation to program themes.</p></description>

    <title>Financial Heartland</title>
    <minimum_credits>16</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>16</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>This program is an historical tour of the forces that molded and shaped the financial centers of three U.S. cities that are now mutual fund, commodity, and capital raising hubs—New York, Boston, and Chicago. This program is designed for students with a strong interest in finance, business, and history.</p><p>Students will have the option to travel to one of the U.S. financial-center cities for a week of research. The goal of these trips is to explore the financial expertise for which each of these cities is known, while also looking at how the wealth created by financial businesses has shaped these cities. Visits are expected to include meetings with various businesspeople and visits to local museums and other cultural sites. For those students unable to travel to the financial heartland cities, an alternative is to conduct a similar type of analysis on three cities in Washington state, looking at the role finance played in their growth and evolution.</p><p>The first part of the quarter will cover the history of the three cities and explore how they came to be financial centers. We will then move on to a discussion of the evolution of mutual funds, commodities, and the capital-raising process. Students will work in groups to research the history or a particular business in one of the financial center cities and present their findings at the end of the quarter, linking this work with their visits to a financial heartland city. There will be a large emphasis on writing, including brief and very focused assignments, as well as seminar papers.</p></description>

    <title>Master in Teaching Year 1</title>
    <minimum_credits>16</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>16</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>More than two decades ago, educator Marilyn Cochrane-Smith asked, &quot;Can prospective teachers learn to be both educators and activists, to regard themselves as agents for change, and to regard reform as an integral part of the social, intellectual, ethical and political activity of teaching?”  In the MiT 2015-17 program, we take up this challenge as we prepare teachers who recognize teaching as a political activity and knowingly take on the role of activist based on a commitment to eliminate the inequities that exist in classrooms and the broader community.</p><p> If we are to be effective advocates for our students and to empower our students to transform their own lives, we must deepen, and perhaps challenge, our current beliefs about teaching and learning.  As teachers we must develop within ourselves the emotional and intellectual attributes needed to understand, support, and teach our future students, and to meet their diverse needs.</p><p> Future teachers can expect to see a more diverse population of students. The MiT program prepares teachers who can draw on the strengths of students from a wide range of ethnic origins, languages, abilities, and socio-economic backgrounds. Further, these students will live in a society requiring people to engage diverse cultures through effective collaboration and creative problem-solving grounded in integrated technological skills and active use of a wide range of information resources. Thus, the MiT program will support candidates to develop as critical, reflective educators who not only care deeply about issues of race, class, poverty, and justice but are prepared to act on these issues to support student achievement.</p><p>Experiences in classrooms serve as vital parts of the MiT program. Field experiences in urban, rural, and suburban communities enable teacher candidates to mediate their understanding of theoretical ideas and concepts presentedin program coursework. Likewise, our academic investigations inform teacher candidates’ experiences in the field. These two sites for learning are bridged through meaningful activities that require teacher candidates to integrate what they learn across classrooms and coursework.</p><p> Among the questions that will engage our study and practice are:</p><ul><li>What effective teaching practices encourage students&apos; curiosity and lead them to shape their own questions and pursue their own answers using critical and reflective thinking?</li><li>How does teachers’ knowledge of learning theory, research-based pedagogy and neurobiology contribute to children&apos;s and adolescents&apos; learning and development?</li><li>How are questions of democracy, equity and excellence related to success or failure in our public schools and civic engagement in a democratic society?</li><li>How are the more traditional literacies of reading, writing, and quantitative reasoning related to personal, economic, and political oppression and power?</li><li>How can teachers respond to and work with family and cultural belief systems that shape children&apos;s lives? How can teachers draw on community resources to connect content knowledge to students&apos; lived experiences?</li></ul></description>

    <title>Work and the Human Condition</title>
    <minimum_credits>8, 12</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>8, 12</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>This class will examine the nature and place of work in human life and culture. Studying literature, philosophy, and history in the Western tradition, we will develop an understanding of work that goes well beyond the concept of work as a way to pay the bills. We will consider important questions: Why is work important in a complete human life? What roles can it play both for an individual and for the whole social system? What meaning does, or can, work have in a person&apos;s life and in a society? What ways of working should a person strive to practice? Who does what work, and why? To better understand and critique challenging material, we will spend time improving skills in close reading, critical reasoning, writing clearly and well, and engaging in focused research. We will examine the ways in which approaching an idea through different disciplinary lenses allows us to deepen our understanding of it—often complicating the picture in generative ways.</p><p><b>During fall quarter</b>
      , we begin our study of ideas about the place of work in human life and the concept of
      <em>labor</em>
      , which concerns how humans stay alive; that is, what we do to provide ourselves with food, clothing, shelter, and warmth.  We will begin with an introduction to Hannah Arendt’s classic text,
      <i>The Human Condition</i>
      , and focus on the historical changes that lead to industrial labor and erosion of the common world.  We will examine the ways in which the new industrial economy changed where people lived, the work they did, and the ways in which some challenged the capitalist model. We will read primary texts in literature, philosophy, and history. We’ll also use film, visual art, and poetry. 
    </p><p><b>Winter quarter’s studies</b>
      will shift our focus to the creation of the artificial world and the durable objects in it. We will continue working with Arendt’s text, and think about the made world and the art and use objects that make it up. Historically central to human labor has been the laboring of women and of slaves, whose place was in the home: in the private rather than the public sphere. In the winter, we’ll read work from Frederick Douglas, as well as Harriet Beecher Stowe’s
      <i>Uncle Tom’s Cabin</i>
      , and George Eliot’s
      <i>Middlemarch</i>
      .
    </p><p><b>We will conclude the program in spring</b>
      by examining the idea of
      <em>action</em>
      ; that is, the ways in which people interact with each other in politics, science, art, and the public sphere generally. Coming out of the labor experience of women and slaves, political action in the United States will be our focus. We will continue our study of Arendt&apos;s 
      <em>The Human Condition</em>
       and read literary and philosophical texts that inform our ideas of action. We will study liberatory movements as well as action in the arts and sciences.  In their major project work, students will focus on one area in which people engage in action today, such as in liberation movements, in artistic endeavors, and in scientific inquiry.
    </p><p>Credit may be awarded in Philosophy, Literature, Cultural Studies and American Studies.</p><p> </p><p><b>Work and the Human Condition: 12 Credit option</b></p><p>
      Students taking
      <i>Work and the Human Condition</i>
      for 12 credits will focus their work on library research that engages concepts and history they will read about in two required texts. The first is
      <i>The Return of Martin Guerre</i>
      , by Natalie Zemon Davis; the second is the classic historical analysis of E.P. Thompson:
      <i>The Making of the English Working Class</i>
      . Students will meet with program and library faculty on Thursday, October 6 and Thursday, October 13 in the Library classroom. During weeks 3-9 of fall quarter, these students will participate in a “real time” on line seminar. Each week, a student will facilitate the seminar discussion, which will take place in a structured format accessed on the program’s Canvas site. The seminar discussions will focus on the assigned reading for that week. In addition, students will begin a research project connected to the history of labor and work presented in both the
      <i>The Return of Martin Guerre</i>
      and
      <i>The Making of the English Working Class</i>
      .  At the end of fall quarter, they will have completed an annotated bibliography on their topic. They will use their bibliographies as background for their work winter quarter. The 12 credit option will continue for winter quarter, but only for those students who began this work in the fall.

    <title>The Epic and the Everyday</title>
    <minimum_credits>16</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>16</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>
      Must quotidian always be associated with humdrum? Rather, it is perhaps the quotidian—the everyday, the banal—that, in the long run, heroically ensures the survival of the individual and the group as a whole.
      <br/>
      -Michel Maffesoli,
      <em>Walking in the Margins</em></p><p>This program interrogates how the essence of the epic enters the everyday and how the quotidian gives meaning to the epic.</p><p>An epic is generally defined as a poem or narrative of considerable length, which explores grand themes such as a hero’s journey, or an origin myth. As an adjective, epic refers to something that is larger than life and often extra-ordinary. By contrast, the everyday is defined as ordinary and is often seen as boring, trivial, and lacking in grandeur. Yet, the everyday has a rich creative history and garners remarkable attention in contemporary art, spiritual practices, and other areas of study and praxis. Our lives are made up of both the epic and the everyday; both are integral components of the human experience. The tension between the two is rich territory for insight and imagination.</p><p>We will juxtapose the exploration of the epic as a literary form with the exploration of the everyday as a creative practice that engages experiments in text, sound, and image. We will conduct these explorations through readings, film screenings, analyses, lectures, workshops, seminars, and by developing discovery strategies rooted in the creative practices of writing and multimedia projects.</p><p>Students will read ancient Greek epic poetry, myth, and tragedy. These works tap deeply into the human condition, and they explore our most persistent and universal questions, such as the concepts of destiny, power, morality, mortality, and the (in-)evitability of fate. As we analyze the grand questions raised by epic texts we will also consider if or how we encounter such themes in everyday life, and how everyday life may intersect with epic-scale experiences and insights.</p><p>Students will also develop a daily writing practice and craft a variety of essays based on our readings. Key assignments will include a variety of experimental audio or multimedia productions as well as writing exercises exploring the themes of the program. The program will include rigorous individual projects that encompass a research paper and a collaborative or individual audio or multimedia production.</p><p>This is a full-time program emphasizing classical Greek literature and media arts, creative and critical practice, collaborative learning, and individual accountability. Expect assignments to be process-driven, highly structured, and challenging. Students are expected to work about 40 hours per week including class time. If you are eager to blend the study of ancient Greek literature with experiments in media arts, then this program is for you.</p></description>

    <description><p>In this program students will have the opportunity to learn intellectual concepts and skills essential for advanced work in computer science and beneficial for computing work supporting other disciplines. Students will achieve a deeper understanding of increasingly complex computing systems by acquiring knowledge and skills in mathematical abstraction, problem-solving, and the organization, and analysis of hardware and software systems. The program covers material such as algorithms, data structures, computer organization and architecture, logic, discrete mathematics, and programming in the context of the liberal arts and compatible with model curriculum developed by the Association for Computing Machinery&apos;s Liberal Arts Computer Science Consortium.</p><p>Program content will be organized around four interwoven themes. The computational organization theme covers concepts and structures of computing systems from digital logic to the computer architecture supporting high-level languages and operating systems. The programming theme concentrates on learning how to design and code computer programs to solve problems. The mathematical theme helps develop mathematical reasoning, theoretical abstractions, and problem-solving skills needed for computer scientists. A technology and society theme explores social, historical, or philosophical topics related to science and technology.</p></description>

    <description><p><em>Becoming is superior to being.</em>  –Paul Klee</p><p>In this interdisciplinary program, we will explore shaping of the self and the world from the perspectives and processes of psychology and art. We will consider how these two practices can inform, shape, and express our past, present, and future identities.</p><p>Psychological perspectives will examine questions such as: How do my culture, society, institutions (e.g. schools, houses of worship), and family influence my identities? Do my ingrained beliefs limit or expand who I am? Do I dare to find my authentic self? Paradigm shifts in thinking (from dichotomous and hierarchical to holistic) and learning (from conceptual to transformative) will be emphasized through lectures, workshops, reflective and expressive writing activities, and mindfulness practices. In arts studios over the course of the program, we will learn drawing, crafting, and sculpture techniques as means to explore and express oneself. In a world full of stuff, what does it mean to be a maker of things? How can the things we make serve our need for self-expression even as they serve and enrich the cultures we live in? And how can making things itself be a practice of mindfulness? Beginning from a close haptic understanding of materials we use, and study of their environmental and cultural significances, we will make imagery and objects to develop our distinctive voices and handling, and to express ourselves and the selves of others. We will work to contextualize, write about, and speak for what we make in the world.</p><p>Individual and collaborative work, readings, and seminars will address the program&apos;s generative questions of identity, making, and materiality. Possible readings include <em>The Gift: Creativity and the Artist in the Modern World</em> (Hyde) and <em>The Thinking Hand</em> (Pallasmaa). Field trips and visiting artists and lecturers will further enrich our perspectives. Engaged students can expect to gain deeper knowledge of both psychology and art, fuller awareness and understanding of their own identities in the midst of complex cultural and social worlds, and greater agency as creative artists and individuals seeking to make positive change through their thinking and actions.</p><p>Note: this program is designed for students new to the college experience.</p></description>

    <title>Introduction to Natural Sciences</title>
    <minimum_credits>16</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>16</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>This program will offer students a conceptual and methodological introduction to biology and chemistry. In order to understand our world from a scientific perspective, we need to be able to analyze complex systems at multiple levels. We need to understand the ways that matter transforms chemically and how energy and entropy drive those transformations. Biological systems can be understood at the molecular level, but we also need to know about cells, organisms, and ecological systems and how they change over time. The language for describing these systems is both quantitative and computational. We will have a strong focus on the evolutionary mechanisms that have led to the current life on earth, and interpretation and design of experimental tests for hypotheses in biology and chemistry.</p><p>The integration of biology and chemistry will assist us in asking and answering questions that lie in the intersections of these fields. Such topics include the chemical structure of DNA, the flow of nutrients and energy through ecosystems, mathematical modeling of biological population growth, equations governing chemical equilibria and kinetics, and the algorithms underlying bioinformatics. Program activities will include lectures, small group problem-solving workshops, laboratory and field work, and seminar discussions. Students will learn to describe their work through scientific writing and public presentations. Our laboratory work in biology and chemistry will also allow us to observe phenomena, collect data, and gain firsthand insight into the complex relationship between mathematical models and experimental results. There will be a significant laboratory component—students can expect to spend at least a full day in the lab each week, maintain laboratory notebooks, write formal laboratory reports, and give formal presentations of their work. Biology laboratories in this program will include participation in the SEA-PHAGE program coordinated by the Howard Hughes Medical Institute and the use of bioinformatics tools on a bacteriophage genome.</p><p>In addition to studying current scientific theories, we will consider the historical, societal, and personal factors that influence our thinking about the natural world. We will also examine the impacts on societies due to changes in science and technology. Spring quarter there will be an opportunity for small student groups to conduct independent, scientific investigations designed in collaboration with program faculty.</p><p>This program is designed for students who want a solid preparation for further study in the sciences. Students who only want to get a taste of science will find this program quite demanding and should consult with faculty before the program begins. Overall, we expect students to end the program in spring with a working knowledge of scientific, mathematical, and computational concepts, ability to reason critically and to solve problems, and with hands-on experience in natural science.</p></description>

    <title>Studio Projects: The Seen and Unseen</title>
    <minimum_credits>16</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>16</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>This is an entry-level visual arts program emphasizing 2- and 3-D studio practices, art history, visual literacy, artistic research, and writing. We will delve intensively into the development of studio skills in 3D design, photography, small-scale sculpture, mixed media, and drawing, while exploring how these material gestures express content. The overarching questions being posed by this program will focus on the seen and unseen. What do artists choose to reveal and conceal in their work? More importantly, what does it mean for art to be made within the context of secrets? This very question lies at the tensions found in historical/religious traditions of image-making (especially in the Abrahamic traditions) and can be found across the myriad landscapes of art production. Students will focus on the stakes and implications of inclusion/exclusion in regards to the content of their work and the decision-making process surrounding that work.</p><p>As a working group, students will engage in an art practice that explores what it means to be in conversation with art history and the sociopolitical world, drawing encouragement and influence from a greater community of artists, philosophers, writers, and social critics.</p><p>The program is designed to support students interested in the visual arts, as well as those who are curious about visual literacy and want to experience using materials as an approach to inquiry and expression. No prior art experience is necessary, but enthusiasm, curiosity, and a strong work ethic are required. Students should be prepared to dedicate at least 40 hours per week to studio work and rigorous reading and writing on topics related to the concepts of 20th- and 21st-century art history and critical theory. Students will be exposed to an interdivisional approach to visual arts that includes both art and humanities work: studio work; art history; visual/cultural studies, including literature, philosophy, and history; and a significant writing component.</p><p>Fall and winter quarters will provide students with basic studio experience with several material approaches and will offer design and drawing workshops. Students will work in either 2-D or 3-D fall quarter, switching to the other medium in winter. There will be visits to regional museums and we will attend the Art Lecture Series. In the spring, students will have the opportunity to apply their learning to individual projects, utilizing knowledge and skills gained over fall and winter. By the end of this program, students will understand how one engages with an art community to share support and inspiration, and how the artist’s work expands beyond that community and connects to critical issues. Students will begin to imagine how to situate their own projects in terms of the world around them.</p></description>

    <title>Washington State Legislative Internships</title>
    <minimum_credits>16</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>16</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>Taking advantage of Evergreen&apos;s proximity to the capital of Washington State, this internship presents the opportunity to observe first hand the development of public policy in that arena. Drawing from the social sciences and systems and change theory, students explore the evolving systems of law, regulation, and governance. Students will learn about proposed legislation on a variety of issues. They will reflect on the dynamics of the legislative process as a means for making change.</p><p>Each student will work as an intern with a legislator and her or his staff for a regular forty-hour work week during the 2017 legislative session. Intensive staff-apprenticeship activities include conducting legislative research, drafting policy and other documents, bill tracking, and constituent communications. Responsibilities also include attendance at guest presentations, seminars, workshops on budget, and media panels.</p><p>Students accepted as legislative interns will develop an internship learning contract, profiling legislative responsibilities and linkages to their academic development.</p><p>Each intern will keep a weekly journal that is submitted to the faculty sponsor on a regular basis and a portfolio of all materials related to legislative work submitted upon faculty request. During regular in-capitol seminars, Evergreen interns will confer with colleagues and the faculty sponsor to address challenges and reflect upon their experiences. Each intern will translate his or her activities in the internship into analytic and reflective writing about what they are learning and implications of the work by producing a minimum of three short essays per quarter. Students will also write a self-evaluation at the end of each quarter. At the conclusion of the legislative session during spring quarter, interns will produce a substantial integrative essay, and meet with colleagues in person to review and reflect upon their legislative internship experience.</p><p>Students are encouraged to serve as interns over both winter and spring quarters. In winter quarter, interns will have a Legislative Internship Contract for 16 credits; for spring quarter, students can develop an 8-credit Legislative Internship Contract and augment it with another 8-credit project or program involving specific post-session research and writing. Student performance for the two-quarter internship is evaluated by the faculty sponsor, field supervisors and legislative office staff.</p></description>

    <title>Feminist Jurisprudence</title>
    <minimum_credits>16</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>16</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>Feminist jurisprudence is a philosophy of law based on the political, economic, and social equality of the sexes. Students will be introduced to various schools of thought and concepts of inequality in the law spanning historical periods from the 1920s (ratification of the 19th Amendment to the Constitution) to the present. Students will investigate historical foundations of gender inequality as well as the history of legal attempts to address that inequality, including U.S. Supreme Court cases; Federal laws, including Title VII and Title IX; and feminist jurisprudence. Lectures and discussions will include topics on the development of the Constitutional standard for sex equality, legal feminism from the 1970s to the present incorporating work and family as well as home and workplace conflicts. Students and faculty will review legal precedents related to feminist jurisprudence raised by the Supreme Court’s interpretations of the law and analyzed and discussed by the legal community in law review articles and related academic research. </p><p>Issues presented by the cases will include, among others: women as lawyers, women and reproduction, prostitution, surrogacy and reproductive technology, women and partner violence, pornography, sexual harassment, taxation, gender and athletics. Students will also examine current and historical documents on inequality and legal issues that continue to impact women. Intersections of gender and race will also be critically analyzed.</p><p>The Socratic method and lectures will be the principal modes of instruction. Student panel presentations on assigned topics/cases will contribute to new knowledge and an enhanced understanding of feminist jurisprudence and its place in the historical development of women’s rights and responsibilities. </p><p>In addition to panel presentations, students will be required to produce legal memoranda, journals and a final research project submitted in one of the following forms: a well-documented research paper/article on feminist jurisprudence, an art/graphics project reflecting historical or current women’s legal issues, or a forum on a specific feminist legal issue/topic, among others.</p></description>

    <title>Practice of Organic Farming: Fall</title>
    <minimum_credits>16</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>16</maximum_credits>
    <description><p><strong>Note: This is the third quarter of a spring-summer-fall program.</strong></p><p>What does it take to be successful at farming? The Practice of Organic Farming, formerly the Practice of Sustainable Agriculture, is a three-quarter program (spring, summer, and fall) that can help you answer this question and more. This program will explore the knowledge and skills needed to be successful in organic farming and food-production systems using the underlying sciences as a framework. Due to the interdisciplinary nature of agriculture, the various topical threads (plant science, soils, horticulture, animal husbandry, organic regulations, business, etc.) will be presented throughout all three quarters, and our primary focus will be on small-scale, direct market, organic production. We will emphasize the scientific underpinning and practical applications critical for growing food using ecologically informed methods, along with the management and business skills appropriate for small-scale production.</p><p>We will be studying and working at the Evergreen Organic Farm through an entire growing season, from starting seed to the sale of farm products, to preparing the farm for winter. All students will work on the farm every week to gain practical experiential learning (one day per week in spring, two days per week in summer and fall). This program is rigorous both physically and academically and requires a willingness to work outside in adverse weather on a schedule determined by the needs of crops and animals raised on the farm.</p><p>Topics will follow activities on the farm throughout the growing season. During spring quarter our primary focus will be exploring soil and plant sciences, gaining quantitative skills, and developing a working knowledge of the yearly planning documents that guide the organic farm. Beginning with the organic system plan and the farm crop plan, we will study documents and record-keeping systems needed to guide our work throughout the growing season. In summer the main focus will be integrated pest management for insects, weeds, and diseases. Marketing, water management, irrigation system design, and regulatory issues will also be covered. Fall quarter&apos;s focus will be on farm and business planning and cover crops.</p><p>The farm practicum provides students with the opportunity to integrate theory with the practice of farming. Students will learn the various elements and systems of the farm and hands-on skills throughout the growing season. These skills and topics will include livestock care, greenhouse management, crop establishment and management (seeding, transplanting, irrigating, weeding, harvesting, marketing), monitoring for pests/diseases, equipment maintenance/repair, and composting. Students will also learn how to market produce through community-supported agriculture (CSA), as well as a market stand.</p><p>If you are a student with a disability and would like to request accommodation, please contact the faculty or Access Services at L2153, or phone (360)867-6348; TTY (360)867-6834) prior to the start of the quarter. If you require accessible transportation for field trips, please contact faculty well in advance of field trip dates to allow time to arrange this.</p><p>Students planning to take this program who are receiving financial aid should contact financial aid early in fall quarter 2015 to develop a financial aid plan that includes summer quarter 2016.</p><p> </p></description>

    <description><p>This introductory program brings together a variety of climate and energy issues occurring on Native American homelands. Students will explore the science and ethics of energy production and consumption, the environmental impacts of energy, and topics in alternative energy. For example, we will investigate impacts of hydropower on Native communities and cultures while learning the science associated with this energy source. Students will also examine contemporary Native American struggles to resist cultural and environmental devastation to their communities and their efforts to affirm tribal sovereignty and indigenous knowledge. Students will gain a solid understanding of both the science of energy and Native American tribal sovereignty in order to fully comprehend these issues. We will approach our learning through a variety of modes, including hands-on labs, lectures, workshops, field trips, group work, research papers, and weekly seminars on a variety of related topics.</p></description>

    <description><p>What should we eat? What is the link between diet and health? How is our diet shaped by our agricultural practices? How sustainable is our food system?</p><p>This program will take a scientific approach to food and cooking. Throughout history, food and cooking have not only been essential for human sustenance, but have played a central role in the economic and cultural life of civilizations. This interdisciplinary exploration of food will take a broad ecological systems approach as it examines the biology and chemistry of food while also incorporating political, historical, and anthropological perspectives. Topics will span a broad range of scale, from ecological agriculture to molecular structure, including sustainable production, the coevolution of humans and food, the connection between food and medicine, as well as the transformation of food through the processes of cooking and fermentation.</p><p>Students will directly apply major concepts learned in lectures to experiments in the laboratory and kitchen. Field trips will provide opportunities for observing food production and processing in the local community. Program themes will be reinforced in problem-solving workshop sessions and seminar discussions focused on topics addressed by such authors as Michael Pollan, Harold McGee, Gary Paul Nabhan, Sidney Mintz, and Sandor Katz.</p><p>Fall quarter we will introduce the concept of food systems and analyze conventional and sustainable agricultural practices. We will examine the botany of vegetables, fruits, seed grains, and legumes that constitute most of the global food supply. In parallel, we will study the genetic principles of plant and animal breeding and the role of evolution in the selection of plant and animal species used as food by different human populations. We will consider concepts in molecular biology that will allow us to understand and assess genetically modified crops.</p><p>Winter quarter we shift our attention to cooking and nutrition. We will explore the biochemistry of food, beginning with basic chemical concepts, before moving on to the structure of proteins, carbohydrates, and fats. We will study meat, milk, eggs, vegetables, and cereal doughs and examine what happens at a biochemical level during the process of cooking and baking. We will explore how our bodies digest and recover nutrients, and consider the physiological roles of vitamins and antioxidants, as well as the complex relationship between diet, disease, and genetics. Finally, we will study the physiology of taste and smell, critical for the appreciation of food.</p><p>Spring quarter we will examine the relationship between food and microbes from several perspectives. We will produce specific fermented foods while studying underlying biochemical reactions. We will also consider topics in microbiology as they relate to food safety and food preservation, and focus on the human microbiome, including specific interactions between particular microbes and the human immune system.</p></description>

    <description><p>How does the body make—and make its way into—literature? This interdisciplinary program approaches writing as an embodied process involving both discipline and play, ritual and improvisation. Through movement practices, reading, and creative writing, students will refine narrative moves, generate site specific texts, and finally develop a body of work in fiction, nonfiction, and, optionally, the related narrative arts of performance or comics.</p><p>Over the course of the two quarter program, we will cultivate physical practices that support the peculiarly active stillness of writing, from secular meditation to walking and other movement disciplines. Our readings pose the question: what is the body, anyway? The texts under consideration span fiction, performance texts, and nonfiction (including science writing, philosophy, religious studies, and cultural criticism), taking up the body as a strange site, both real and imaginary. We’ll look at how different writers contest and/or celebrate embodied experiences of racialization, gender, ability, class, and intersections thereof—improvising with literary genres along the way. And we’ll consider the body as a porous interface between individual experience, (eco)systems, and stories.</p><p class="p1">
      New participants are warmly invited to join this program winter quarter. In winter,
      <span style="line-height: 1.5em;">students will focus on a sustained writing and research project, situating their own work in relation to a self-selected lineage of books and bodily practices. Students will compile a bibliography and generate new work in a genre of their choosing. To share processes and final outcomes, students have the option of working in a secondary genre of performance or comics.</span></p><p>We will metabolize and ground our inquiries in writing, practicing moves common to fiction, nonfiction, and other forms of storytelling (comics and performance) by way of prompts and games. Essaying about assigned texts is an occasional requirement, but we’ll situate so-called critical writing on this spectrum of expressive and rigorously playful prose. We will write from stillness and movement, in the classroom and elsewhere. No previous movement training is necessary, and adaptions can be arranged for physical access as needed.</p></description>

    <description><p>How shall we study music? We can watch others doing it on YouTube, we can hear others doing it on YouPod or we can read about others doing it on YouKindle.</p><p>Let&apos;s DO it! (Sadly, there&apos;s no &quot;YouDo&quot;.)</p><p>Let&apos;s study music by creating and performing it. After all, music&apos;s a thing made by the brain, the heart and the fingers.</p><p>You&apos;ll be asked to study an instrument and perform for others in the class.  You will also be asked to write vocal and instrumental arrangements, sing and perform them. The class environment will not be a competitive one: the goal is to stretch out, learn, and challenge oneself rather than to compare one someone with another someone. The study of music requires a commitment to practice, to listen, to remember and to learn. This program offers you time in which to do just that.</p><p>You&apos;ll learn about writing harmonies, singing them, and about how difficult it is to write vocal parts that are interesting both melodically and harmonically. There will be a strong emphasis on ear training, sight singing, and aural dictation, along with studies in tonal harmony. You&apos;ll be asked to write and perform musical canons. We&apos;ll study the history of Western classical music, jazz music from the early 20th century, popular music of the past 50 years and experiments in music composition as well. There will be regular listening sessions, along with readings from the arts.</p><p>In class, students will be assigned performance groups, and each group will be asked to prepare a vocal or instrumental work. This will happen twice each quarter. Rehearsal time will be set aside for such practice, and the faculty will act as a coach for the rehearsals. Each quarter, students will be asked to write one substantial research paper exploring an aspect of music they are unfamiliar with. There will be class trips to concerts in Seattle and Portland, along with visiting guest artists throughout the year.</p><p>In addition to classroom activities, each student will be expected to take instruction in a musical instrument outside of class and bear the cost of that instruction (the faculty member can help you find a teacher for your instrument). Practicing an instrument is a way to bring together the seemingly separate activities of the brain, the heart and the fingers: it concretizes music theory, gives a goal to the wobbling fingers and releases the heart from its regularity of &quot;thump thump thump&quot;.</p></description>

    <title>Russia and the Forging of Empires: Vikings, Mongols, and Slavs</title>
    <minimum_credits>4, 12, 16</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>4, 12, 16</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>This program offers an interdisciplinary approach to Russian and Eurasian history, literature, culture, geography, and film. Our journey will take us across the territories that once comprised the Russian and Soviet empires—territories that today make up more than 15 independent states. In lectures, seminars, and film analyses and discussions, we will travel from the fjords of Norway to the cities of Constantinople and Baghdad; from the grasslands of Mongolia to the Moscow cathedrals; from the Arctic Ocean to the marketplaces of Central Asia; from the peaks of the Caucasus Mountains to the deserts of Uzbekistan.</p><p>Our focus is the rise and fall of empires in this region, beginning with the Mongol and Russian empires. We will investigate the development of the Russians through history, starting with Viking invasions of Slavic territories in the 800s and progressing to the thriving imperial era in the 1800s. This latter period witnessed not only Napoleon&apos;s invasion, but the initial emergence of the great culture for which Russia is well known. This included the literature of Pushkin, Lermontov, Gogol, and Turgenev, the beginnings of the Russian national school of art, the start of Russian nationalist music, and the first collections of Russian folklore.This latter period witnessed not only Napoleon&apos;s invasion, but the emergence of great literature (including Pushkin, Lermontov, Gogol, and Turgenev). The diverse ethnicities that had cultural, political, social, economic, and religious contact with the Russians—the Vikings, Mongols, Greeks, Tatars and Turkic peoples, among others—will all play key roles in our examinations.</p><p>Faculty will provide lectures and students will read and discuss a diverse selection of historical and literary texts in seminars, view and discuss documentaries and films, and write three major essays. We will also undertake a field trip to the Maryhill Museum to view their icon collection and other Russian- and east European-related items and to a Greek Orthodox women’s monastery in Goldendale, Washington, for a tour of the grounds and the icon studio, all geared to expanding our understanding of the spiritual roots of the evolving early Russian culture.</p><p>Students are strongly urged to take the Beginning Russian Language segment within the full-time program. Those who opt out of language should register for only 12 credits.</p></description>

    <title>The Soviet Union and the Rebirth of Russia: Stalin,  Gorbachev, and Putin</title>
    <minimum_credits>4, 12, 16</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>4, 12, 16</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>This program will investigate the 74-year lifespan of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR), as well as the two decades that have passed since its collapse in 1991. We will explore poetry and prose and analyze why the USSR produced such remarkable and world-renowned talents as writers Bulgakov and Solzhenitsyn and composers Prokofiev and Shostakovich. We shall also investigate how this society included inhumane prison camps and totalitarian rule. Indeed, how did Josef Stalin became responsible for the murder of at least 20 million of his fellow citizens while at the same time transforming a relatively backward empire into an undisputed world power?</p><p>Economic difficulties and shortages of consumer goods plagued citizens of the USSR until its collapse, but the empire’s last leader, Mikhail Gorbachev, did his best to revitalize the Soviet socialist experiment. Gorbachev’s campaigns to “restructure” the empire’s economy and become more “open” towards a free press simply hastened the collapse of the empire. We will examine these policies, but equally as important, we will also investigate the rise of 15 independent states that emerged and trace their paths since they gained independence in 1991. Vladimir Putin has led Russia since 2000 and his authoritarian policies suggest that he will remain in power until 2024.</p><p>Faculty will provide lectures to guide our study, students will read and discuss a diverse selection of historical and literary texts in seminars, and we will view and discuss relevant documentaries and films. The centerpiece of student work will be a major research paper on any topic connected with the Soviet Union and Russia, along with the production of a professional-quality poster for a final presentation. Students will be able to choose between language study and a history workshop segment, which will investigate aspects of the &quot;Cold War&quot; from U.S. and Soviet perspectives, as well as lend a greater understanding of the worldwide struggle for political, economic, military, and ideological supremacy.</p></description>

    <title>Russia Falls, the Soviet Union Rises: Imperial Beauty, Turmoil, and Tragedy</title>
    <minimum_credits>4, 12, 16</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>4, 12, 16</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>This program emphasizes the Russian Empire’s extraordinary political, historical, literary, artistic, and musical developments of the 19th and early 20th centuries. We will explore literary masterpieces by Dostoevsky, Turgenev, Tolstoy, and Chekhov; examine paintings by Repin, Nesterov, and Vereshchagin; and listen to the compositions of Mussorgsky, Rimsky-Korsakov, and Tchaikovsky. We will also examine the rise of the Russian Empire’s radical intelligentsia who rebelled against autocratic tsarist policies and the institution of serfdom and whose activities led to the world-changing revolutions of the early 20th century.</p><p>Readings from social and revolutionary activists, such as Marx and Lenin, will allow us to better understand how these thinkers managed to transform the economically and socially “backward” Russian Empire into the planet’s most experimental and, at times, most feared political power. Our diverse readings from Russian and Soviet imperial literature and history will help us appreciate the cultural, social, and political nuances of this expansive, beguiling, and enigmatic land.</p><p>
      Along with faculty lectures to guide our study, we will read and discuss in seminar a diverse selection of historical and literary texts; view and discuss relevant documentaries and films; and write two major essays based on seminar readings. A special all-program workshop in the art of
      <em>pysanky</em>
       (wax-resist egg decorating) will offer a hands-on Slavic folk art experience. 
    </p><p>Students may choose between Russian language study and a special history workshop segment to earn the full 16 credits. The history workshop familiarizes students with Russia’s status as a multiethnic and multi-confessional empire. Students and faculty explore the myriad of nationalities within the expanding 19th-century Russian Empire from the perspective of the Imperial government and from the viewpoint of the non-Russian peoples resident in the empire. We will consider the impact of growing Russian nationalistic discourse in the late 19th century and assess its role in the disintegration of the empire. </p></description>

    <description><p>Students will examine in detail a variety of environmental problems, using the skills they gained in their first year of MES core studies to carry out individual or small group projects. Students and faculty will also work together to apply what has been learned throughout the core sequence about interdisciplinary environmental research to design individual thesis research plans that will be ready to carry out by the end of the fall quarter of the student&apos;s second year.</p></description>

    <description><p>This program provides a framework for understanding current environmental issues from an interdisciplinary perspective. Students will begin to develop the skills to become producers of new knowledge, rather than being strictly learners of information already available. Multiple methods of data acquisition and analysis will be introduced through examples drawn from many fields of study. The philosophy of science and the problematic relationship between science and policy are also introduced.</p></description>

    <title>Performance in Process:  Examining Performance as an Opportunity for Personal and Social Change</title>

    <description><p><em>I believe that we learn by practice. Whether it means to learn to dance by practicing dancing or to learn to live by practicing living, the principles are the same.</em>
       –Martha Graham
    </p><p>What role do performances play for the performer? For the audience? Can our experiences on stage impact ways we experience the world when we are off the stage?</p><p>In this program we will explore the role of performance as a learning process. We will consider opportunities for personal growth as well as possibilities for significant social impact that performance opportunities provide. Performance types to be explored will include speeches, presentations, and stage productions of all kinds but with a strong focus on music. We will examine the process of performance from its preparatory stages to its aftermath, and address the psychological and physiological components present. We will consider the paradoxical role of ego throughout the process, the importance of mastery of craft, the physical and mental stamina demands, and the critical role of intentionality.</p><p>We will also examine performance as a powerful tool for social change as well as personal growth. Students will consider and deconstruct human tendencies to identify ourselves or our group as superior to others. We will contrast this perspective with an examination of powerful performances that emphasize connections across perceived boundaries. We will explore how these performances communicated ideas that significantly impacted the direction of social and political movements throughout the 20th and into the 21st century.</p><p>Our work throughout the quarter will include exploration of a variety of learning theories, skill-building workshops, writing activities, physical and mental conditioning, ensemble coaching, and performance workshops. Each performance throughout the program is an important step in the learning process rather than the endgame. Through each of the course activities as well as course readings, students will be offered the opportunity to further develop their awareness of the possibilities for personal growth through regular and thoughtful consideration of what connects us as humans.</p></description>

    <title>Undergraduate Projects in Critical and Creative Practices</title>
    <minimum_credits>0</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>0</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>This is an opportunity for students to work on faculty-driven scholarly and creative projects. By working with faculty in a studio and research “apprentice” model, students will gain hands-on experience in visual arts studio practices, film/media production practices, the creative writing workshop focused on craft, critical research and writing, library and archival research practices, and much more.</p><p><strong>Naima Lowe</strong> (experimental media and performance art) creates films, videos, performances, and written works that explore issues of race, gender, and embodiment. The majority of her work includes an archival research element that explores historical social relationships and mythic identities. She is currently working on a series of short films and performances that explore racial identity in rural settings. Students working with Naima will have opportunities to learn media production and post-production skills (including storyboarding, scripting, 16 mm and HD video shooting, location scouting, audio recording, audio/video editing, etc.) through working with a small crew comprised of students and professional artists. Students would also have opportunities to do archival and historical research on African-Americans living in rural settings, and on literature, film, and visual art that deals with similar themes. Students are generally best equipped for this option if they have taken at least one full year of studies in Media or Visual Arts in a program such as MediaWorks, NonFiction Media, or its equivalent.</p><p><strong>Shaw Osha</strong> (visual art) works in painting, photography, drawing, writing, and video. She explores issues of visual representation, affect as a desire, social relationship, and the conditions that surround us. She is currently working on a project based on questions of soul in artwork. Students working with Shaw will have opportunities to learn about artistic research, critique, grant and statement writing, website design, studio work, and concerns in contemporary art making.</p><p><strong>Joli Sandoz</strong> (creative nonfiction) directs scholarly research focused on critique and/or the writing of creative nonfiction, or critique and/or design of analog games.  This opportunity is open to people nearing the end of their Evergreen education, who may wish to pursue a major research project, senior thesis, or capstone project in their particular relevant interest. Projects of this type bring together theory and application in the critical and creative pursuit of knowledge new to the researcher.  Outstanding creative and critical projects add value to graduate school and job applications, and can enhance skills in synthesis, analysis, and creative thinking and practice. Sandoz specializes in personal and lyric essays, and in board and card games; she does not sponsor projects centered on autobiography, memoir, or computer games (interesting as those topics are).</p></description>

    <title>Art of Mexico</title>
    <minimum_credits>8</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>8</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>This program will examine Mexican art and history through the lens of its creative practitioners.  We will take a thematic approach to our historical studies, exploring Mesoamerican art, poetry and spirituality, native paths of resistance to the conquest and the survival of native art forms and beliefs, the feminism of Sor Juana Ines de la Cruz, the Virgin of Guadalupe, Frida Kahlo, Chicano art, and the post-revolutionary Mexican mural and printmaking traditions--considered the most radical art of the 20th century. Moving from theory to practice we will engage in studio art that is relevant to our cultural studies, which could include mask-making, performance art, collage and book arts. Students will learn how to analyze and critique art and will study the principles of design.  There will be a strong focus on reading, writing, research and seminar discussions.</p></description>

    <description><p>Rigorous quantitative and qualitative research is an important component of academic learning in Environmental Studies. This independent learning opportunity is designed to allow advanced students to delve into real-world research with faculty who are currently engaged in specific projects. The program will help students develop vital skills in research design, data acquisition and interpretation, written and oral communication, collaboration, and critical thinking skills—all of which are of particular value for students who are pursuing a graduate degree, as well as for graduates who are already in the job market.</p><p><strong>Abir Biswas</strong>
      studies nutrient and toxic trace metal cycles in terrestrial and coastal ecosystems. Potential projects could include studies of mineral weathering, wildfires, and mercury cycling in ecosystems. Students could pursue these interests at the laboratory scale or through field-scale biogeochemistry studies, taking advantage of the Evergreen Ecological Observation Network (EEON), a long-term ecological study area. Students with backgrounds in a combination of geology, biology, or chemistry could gain skills in soil, vegetation, and water collection and learn methods of sample preparation and analysis for major and trace elements.
    </p><p><b>Lalita Calabria</b>
      focuses on biodiversity and conservation of bryophytes and lichens in temperate North America. As a broadly trained plant biologist, Lalita uses a multidisciplinary approach to investigating these topics including floristic surveys, ecological studies, herbarium-based research and phytochemical studies of plants. Current activities in her lab focus on assessing the impacts of fire on lichen and bryophyte communities of oak woodlands and prairies, estimating biomass and functional group diversity of bryophyte and lichen ground layers in Puget Sound prairies and quantifying biological nitrogen fixation rates of moss-cyanobacteria symbiosis. Students with backgrounds in botany, ecology, or chemistry could gain skills in bryophyte and lichen identification, as well as, field monitoring methods and studying symbiosis of bryophytes and lichens. Students participating in this program would engage with ongoing research in Lalita’s lab and may have opportunities to develop their own research projects.
    </p><p><strong>Gerardo Chin-Leo</strong>
      studies marine phytoplankton and bacteria. His research interests include understanding the factors that control seasonal changes in the biomass and species composition of Puget Sound phytoplankton. In addition, he is investigating the role of marine bacteria in the geochemistry of estuaries and hypoxic fjords.

She and her students study leaf litter decomposition in streams as a major input of organic material to aquatic systems. In addition, she conducts research on aquatic macroinvertebrate community structure, aquatic fungal biomass and standard water quality and hydrology measurements in stream and river environments.
    </p><p><strong>Alison Styring</strong>
      studies birds. Current activity in her lab includes avian bioacoustics and avian monitoring and research in Evergreen’s campus forest and other nearby locations. Bioacoustic research includes field monitoring of local birds using audio recordings and microphone arrays, and editing and identifying avian songs and calls from an extensive collection of sounds from the campus forest as well as tropical forest sites in Borneo. Local research projects in the campus forest and nearby locations include Pacific wren mating and life-history strategy, cavity formation and use by cavity-nesting birds (and other cavity-dependent species), and monitoring long-term trends in bird populations and communities using a variety of standard approaches.
    </p><p><strong>Erik Thuesen</strong>
      conducts research on the ecological physiology of marine animals. He and his students are currently investigating the physiological, behavioral, and biochemical adaptations of gelatinous zooplankton to environmental stress and climate change. Other research is focused on the biodiversity of marine zooplankton. Students working in his lab typically have backgrounds in different aspects of marine science, ecology, physiology, and biochemistry.
    </p><p><strong>Pauline Yu</strong>
      studies the developmental physiology and ecology of marine invertebrates. She is interested in the biochemistry of the seawater-organism interface, developmental nutritional biochemistry and metabolic depression, invasive species, carbonate chemistry (ocean acidification), and cultural relationships with foods from the sea. Students have the opportunity to collaboratively develop lines of inquiry for lab and/or field studies in ecology, developmental biology, physiology, marine carbonate chemistry and mariculture.

    <description><p>Students of the humanities who are nearing the end of their Evergreen education may wish to pursue a major research project, senior thesis, or capstone project in their particular field of interest. Often, the goal is to construct an original argument around a particular body of literature, set of ideas, or historical events. These kinds of projects develop advanced research skills in the humanities, including the ability to read deeply and critically in a particular field, and to discover and engage with important theoretical writings in that field. Students will also gain valuable skills in reading, analyzing, synthesizing, writing, and editing long pieces of complex prose. The best kinds of this work will be invaluable for graduate school applications, and will be an asset to those entering the job market directly following graduation.</p><p><strong>Stacey Davis</strong> (European history) specializes in French history from the 18th century to the present, as well as the history of French colonies in North and West Africa. Students who wish to study European social, cultural, political, intellectual, or religious history from the Middle Ages to the present, including topics in the history of gender and sociocultural aspects of the history of art, are welcome to propose research projects. Students are welcome to work with Dr. Davis on her ongoing research projects on 19th-century political prisoners, notions of citizenship and democracy in modern Europe, memory, and the history of aging. </p><p><strong>Nancy Koppelman</strong> (American studies) specializes in American social, literary, and intellectual history until 1920. Students who wish to study in these fields are welcome to propose research projects and senior theses. Particular interests include the social and intellectual history of the Puritans; the founding generation, immigrants, the working class, and the middle class; industrialization and reform movements; pragmatic philosophy; the history of childhood; and the history of technology and consumer culture. Students are also welcome to work with Nancy on her ongoing research projects on the histories of social/economic mobility and of individual physical movement.</p><p><strong>Trevor Speller</strong> (British/anglophone literature) specializes in British and Anglophone literature from the 17th century to the present. Students who wish to study literature and literary theory from the Middle Ages to the present are welcome to propose research projects, including capstone projects and senior theses. Previous projects have included studies of Virginia Woolf, Romantic women writers, and travel writing. Dr. Speller is looking for students to assist with his ongoing research projects around the rise of the novel, experimental literature, and conceptions of modernity.</p></description>

    <title>Undergraduate Research in Scientific Inquiry</title>
    <minimum_credits>0</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>0</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>
      Rigorous quantitative and qualitative research is an important component of academic learning in Scientific Inquiry. Research opportunities allow science students to work on specific projects associated with faculty members’ expertise. Students typically begin by working in an apprenticeship model with faculty or laboratory staff and gradually take on more independent projects within the context of the specific research program as they gain experience. Students can develop vital skills in research design, data acquisition and interpretation, modeling and theoretical analysis, written and oral communication, collaboration and critical thinking. These are valuable skills for students pursuing a graduate degree or entering the job market.
      <br/><br/>
      Faculty offering undergraduate research opportunities are listed below. Contact them directly if you are interested.
    </p><p><strong>Abir Biswas</strong>
      (geology, earth science) studies nutrient and toxic trace-metal cycles in terrestrial and coastal ecosystems. Potential projects could include studies of mineral weathering, wildfires, and mercury cycling in ecosystems. Students could pursue these interests at the laboratory scale or through field-scale biogeochemistry studies, taking advantage of the Evergreen Ecological Observation Network (EEON), a long-term ecological study area. Students with backgrounds in a combination of geology, biology, or chemistry can gain skills in soil, vegetation, and water collection and learn methods of sample preparation and analysis for major and trace elements.
    </p><p><strong>Andrew Brabban</strong>
      (biotechnology) studies the physiology and biochemistry of prokaryotes of industrial and agricultural importance. Students who commit at least a full year to a research project, enrolling for 4 to 16 credits each quarter, will learn a broad range of microbiology (both aerobic and anaerobic techniques), molecular (DNA analysis and cloning), and biochemical techniques (chemical and pathway analysis, protein isolation). Students will also have opportunities for internships at the USDA and elsewhere, and to present data at national and international conferences.
    </p><p><strong>Dharshi Bopegedera</strong>
      (chemistry) would like to engage students in two projects: (1) There is concern that toxic metals are found in unsafe quantities in children’s toys and cosmetics. She would like to engage a student in the quantitative determination of these metals, using the AA and the ICP-MS. Students who are interested in learning to use these instruments and quantitative analysis techniques will find this project interesting. (2) Science and education. With Dharshi, students will work with local teachers to develop lab activities that enhance the science curriculum in local schools. Students with an interest in teaching science who have completed general chemistry with laboratory would be ideal for this project. (3) Dharshi is also interested in looking at chemicals present in e-cigarettes. A student interested in this project could work on the organic or inorganic chemicals.
    </p><p><strong>Clarissa Dirks</strong>
      (biology) conducts research in many areas of microbiology and ecology. Her recent work in microbiology has focused on the biodiversity and distribution of tardigrades in different ecosystems. She also aims to better understand the evolutionary principles that underlie the emergence, spread, and containment of infectious disease by studying the co-evolution of retroviruses and their hosts. Lastly, she is conducting snail surveys in Washington state to better characterize the species in the state, something that hasn’t been done in many decades. Depending on the project, students will gain experience in molecular biology techniques, microbiology, field ecology, genetics, bioinformatics, and tissue culture.

      (mathematics) is interested in problems in mathematical biology associated with population and evolutionary dynamics. Students working with him will help create computer simulations using agent-based modeling and cellular automata and analyzing non-linear models for the evolution of cooperative behavior in strategic multiplayer evolutionary games. Students should have a strong mathematics or computer science background.
    </p><p><strong>Lydia</strong><strong>McKinstry</strong>
      (organic chemistry) is interested in organic synthesis research, including asymmetric synthesis methodology, chemical reaction dynamics, and small molecule synthesis. One specific study involves the design and synthesis of enzyme inhibitor molecules to be used as effective laboratory tools with which to study the mechanistic steps of programmed cell death (e.g., in cancer cells). Students with a background in organic chemistry and biology will gain experience with the laboratory techniques of organic synthesis,as well as the techniques of spectroscopy.
    </p><p><strong>Donald Morisato</strong>
      (biology) is interested in the developmental biology of the
      <em>Drosophila</em>
      embryo, a model system for analyzing how patterning occurs. Maternally encoded signaling pathways establish the anterior-posterior and dorsal-ventral axes. Individual student projects will use a combination of genetic, molecular biological, and biochemical approaches to investigate the spatial regulation of this complex process.
    </p><p><strong>Jim Neitzel</strong>
      (biochemistry) uses methods from organic and analytical chemistry to study biologically interesting molecules. A major focus of his current work is on fatty acids; in particular, finding spectroscopic and chromatographic methods to identify fatty acids in complex mixtures and to detect changes that occur in fats during processing or storage. This has relevance both for foods and in biodiesel production. The other major area of interest is in plant natural products, such as salicylates. Work is in process screening local plants for the presence of these molecules, which are important plant-defense signals. Work is also supported in determining the nutritional value of indigenous plants. Students with a background and interest in organic or analytical biochemistry will contribute to this work.
    </p><p><strong>Neal Nelson</strong>
      (computer science) is interested in working with advanced computer topics and current problems in the application of computing to the sciences. His areas of interest include simulations of advanced architectures for distributed computing, advanced programming languages and compilers, and programming languages for concurrent and parallel computing.
    </p><p><strong>Mike Paros</strong>
      (physiology, microbiology, veterinary medicine) is interested in animal health, diseases that affect the animal agriculture industry, and basic ecology of bacteriophage in physiologic systems. Currently funded research includes the development of bacteriophage therapy for dairy cattle mastitis. A number of hands-on laboratory projects are available to students interested in pursuing careers in science, with a particular emphasis on microbiology.
    </p><p><strong>Paula Schofield</strong>
      (organic, polymer, materials chemistry) is interested in the interdisciplinary fields of biodegradable plastics and biomedical polymers. Research in the field of biodegradable plastics is becoming increasingly important to replace current petroleum-derived materials and to reduce the environmental impact of plastic wastes. Modification of starch through copolymerization and use of bacterial polyesters show promise in this endeavor. Specific projects within biomedical polymers involve the synthesis of poly (lactic acid) copolymers that have potential for use in tissue engineering. Students with a background in chemistry and biology will gain experience in the synthesis and characterization of these novel polymer materials. Students will present their work at American Chemical Society (ACS) conferences.
    </p><p><strong>Sheryl Shulman</strong>
      (computer science) is interested in working with advanced computer topics and current problems in the application of computing to the sciences. Her areas of interest include advanced programming languages and compilers, programming language design, programming languages for concurrent and parallel computing, and logic programming.
    </p><p><strong>Rebecca Sunderman</strong>
      (inorganic/materials chemistry, physical chemistry) is interested in the synthesis and property characterization of new bismuth-containing materials. These compounds have been characterized as electronic conductors, attractive activators for luminescent materials, second harmonic generators, and oxidation catalysts for several organic compounds. Traditional solid-state synthesis methods will be utilized to prepare new complex bismuth oxides. Once synthesized, powder x-ray diffraction patterns will be obtained and material properties such as conductivity, melting point, biocidal tendency, coherent light production, and magnetic behavior will be examined when appropriate.
    </p><p><strong>Brian Walter</strong>
      (mathematics) is interested in problems relating to graphs, combinatorial games, and especially, combinatorial games played on graphs. He would like to work with students who have a strong background in mathematics and/or computer science and are interested in applying their skills to open-ended problems relating to graphs and/or games.
    </p><p><strong>Richard Weiss</strong>
      (computer science, mathematics) has several ongoing projects in computer vision, robotics, and security. There are some opportunities for students to develop cybersecurity games for teaching network security concepts and skills. In robotics, he is looking for students to develop laboratory exercises for several different mobile robotic platforms, including Scribbler, LEGO NXT and iRobot Create. This would also involve writing tools for image processing and computer vision using sequences of still images, video streams and 2.5-D images from the Kinect. In addition, he is open to working with students who have their own ideas for projects in these and related areas, such as machine learning, artificial intelligence, and analysis of processor performance.
    </p><p><strong>Pauline Yu</strong>
      (marine science) studies the developmental physiology and ecology of marine invertebrates. She is interested in the biochemistry of the seawater-organism interface, developmental nutritional biochemistry and metabolic depression, invasive species, carbonate chemistry (ocean acidification), and cultural relationships with foods from the sea. Students have the opportunity to collaboratively develop lines of inquiry for lab and/or field studies in ecology, developmental biology, physiology, marine carbonate chemistry and mariculture.
    </p><p class="Body1"><strong>EJ Zita</strong>
      (physics), who has expertise in energy physics, modeling, and organic farming, is researching sustainability and climate change. Many students have done fine projects on sustainable energy and food production in her academic programs. Zita is working with Judy Cushing and Scott Morgan to establish a new research program at Evergreen. She and Cushing will model land use impacts on climate change; she and Morgan will plan and facilitate sustainability projects on campus. More information on Zita&apos;s research is available at

    <description><p>Perhaps the greatest certainty that comes with being alive is that we are all mortal and that someday we will perish.  This is our fate.  How does this unwanted wisdom influence the way we chart a path from birth to our ultimate end?  Would we be different if immortal? In earlier times, these questions were mostly the domain of religion and the arts. But with the dawning of the modern age and the advent of psychology, we are now able to examine mortality from a variety of disciplinary perspectives to better understand how artists, scientists, and intellectuals have provided imaginative and penetrating insights into the phenomenon all living things have in common. In this one quarter, 8 credit program, we will examine the particulars of “self” and “narrative” that are true for each life, whether examined or not. We will explore psychological theory, science, and practice. We will learn how humans have searched for and found meaning in mortality -- through theatre, poetry, visual art, and music -- in works by Shakespeare, Mozart, Kushner, Picasso, and Welles, to name a few. The class may include a Seattle or Tacoma field trip to attend gallery or performance events relevant to our themes. Credits will be awarded in Psychology and Performance Studies.  </p></description>

    <description><p>This year-long sequence of courses in French emphasizes mastery of basic skills through a solid study of grammatical structures and focus on interactive oral activities.  Classes use immersion style learning and students are surrounded by authentic French from the start.  Student work encompasses all four language skills: listening, speaking, reading and writing.  They will develop accurate pronunciation, build a useful vocabulary, work regularly in small groups and learn conversational skills.  Classes are lively and fast-paced with a wide variety of creative, fun activities including music, poetry, videos, role-play, and web sites.   Through aloud reading and discussions in French, students will acquire vocabulary proficiency, accurate pronunciation, fluidity, and dialogues.  Throughout the year, students use the Language Laboratory to accelerate their skills.</p></description>

    <minimum_credits>4</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>4</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>This year-long course is designed for those who are in between Beginning and Intermediate Level, but beyond basic Beginner level.  It is targeted to bring student skills up with overview and review of first year structures moving quickly to more advanced grammar. Classes will be conducted entirely in French.  Students need to have a working knowledge of basic structures, particularly present and past tenses.  The primary objectives are communicative interactions in French, alongside enhanced development of grammatical proficiency.  Students will practice all four language skills: listening, speaking, reading and writing. They will learn not only to express themselves in French, but to understand written and spoken French and discover much they didn&apos;t know about themselves.  Fall quarter Students will develop reading skills through short stories and poetry.   Throughout the year, students use the Language Laboratory to accelerate their skills.</p></description>

    <title>Self and Story: Studies in Psychology, Literature, and Writing</title>
    <minimum_credits>8</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>8</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>Who do you say you are, and why? How and why do people continually adjust and adapt their claims about themselves—their origins, preferences, values, and actions—to suit different audiences and occasions, at times even overhauling their identities completely? We will apply the practices and insights of psychology and the literary arts to the topic of self-narratives, both formal and informal: how they function, the many and varied forms they take, and the highly influential role they play in shaping our understanding of human experience. In the process, we will explore how self-stories can both expand and limit people’s thinking as they interpret their past, narrate their present, and plan their future.</p><p>Through a variety of small- and large-group seminars, lectures, and experiential workshops, we will use psychology as a lens to examine, investigate, and theorize about our own identities and experiences. Recent innovations and activities in the field—for example, James Pennebaker’s groundbreaking work on narrative therapy—will be explored via video conferences with leading social psychologists. Specific topics may include self-determination, willpower, the nature of happiness, and the notion of the double.</p><p>At the same time, we will explore the world of literature with a focus on considerations of the self. Of particular importance will be autobiographical narratives and the rich and intricate issues of memory, authority, persona, and truth that face every self-portraying writer. These accounts—ranging from Charlotte Perkins Gilman&apos;s feminist classic &quot;The Yellow Wallpaper&quot; to Frank McCourt’s contemporary memoir, <i>Angela&apos;s Ashes</i>—embody a particularly critical function of self-stories: to open windows onto times, places, and social and political settings that differ sharply from our own. Writing assignments will include response papers, summaries, short narratives, reflective journals, and a substantial memoir-essay.</p></description>

    <minimum_credits>16</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>16</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>Every sensation, emotion, thought, and movement we experience, we experience in and through our bodies. This year-long program explores how we fully know and express ourselves and our world through the study and practice of authentic movement, music, drawing, writing, and dance. We will examine the formal components of movement through study of experiential anatomy and kinesiology while also exploring the subjective dimensions of experience using instruments and theories of psychology, existential phenomenology, Gestalt, art history, and movement forms such as Open Floor, Authentic Movement, and modern dance technique, improvisation, composition, and performance.</p><p>The first quarter will address foundational and historical roots of somatic psychology, dance, and fine art and introduce practical methods for working with and composing movement, drawing, music, and writing. Through progressively integrated classes in these expressive arts, we will learn concrete methods for accessing the body&apos;s wisdom, beauty, and wholeness. In the second quarter, students play freely with basic theories, principles, and methods for creating original work with personal and social meaning and value. Together we will learn how emotions and thoughts live in the body, and how movement reveals and expresses what we think, feel, sense, and know. Working individually and in groups we will discover how personal decisions and actions affect the group and build holistic communities. Spring quarter integrates learning from fall and winter, linking theory with unique creative applications. Students take the lead in creating, organizing, and performing original multimedia art and performance rituals, and present culminating reports and papers.</p><p>Throughout the year the program will work with multiple forms of intelligence, somatic practices, and integrative expressive arts approaches to learning. Students will explore practices of movement (such as dance or yoga), writing, drawing, and theater in order to cultivate the senses as well as the imagination and powers of expression. These practices will help us understand the deeper aspects of the human experience, which are the source of self-leadership, intentional living, and positive change. Students will also investigate the relationship between inner transformation and social change through engagement in community service.</p><p>Come join us!</p></description>

    <title>Filling the Silence: News, Numbers and Poetry</title>
    <minimum_credits>8</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>8</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>Most people would agree that media censorship undermines democracy. But can the news be censored through silence and under-reporting of important events? In this writing-intensive program of poetry and journalism, we will explore how current issues and events make or do not make the news. Stories in our communities of vital public interest that historically were regularly covered by journalists go largely unreported or under-reported in mass media, only to become the focus of poetry by both the youth-driven spoken word movement and literary poets as well. This vacuum of too little local reporting with a potentially broad audience coupled with poets&apos; burgeoning focus on social justice issues but with much smaller audiences draws into question to what degree our democracy can effectively function and inform the public and decision-makers on issues such as the environment, public health, and systemic racial inequity.</p><p>Specifically, we will explore and engage with two genres of writing - community-based journalism and poetry - to cover critical issues of the day. We will write journalistic articles and craft spoken word and literary poetry to explore themes critical to marginalized and majority communities. Quantitative reasoning is an integrative part of both journalism and poetry and are to be woven into written assignments. Additionally, this program will explore the statistical process of obtaining, describing, interpreting and using of the quantitative data in news making, and engage with the surprising yet fascinating mathematical aspect of poetry. </p><p>Our poetic study and practice will be partially based on the visionary work of the national spoken word/slam poetry movement. Beginning in its current form in the late 1980s, spoken word is a vital and energetic movement in poetry, revitalizing poetry as a performing art. Connecting poetry to its roots in oral tradition, spoken word and poetry slams are often highly politicized, drawing upon racial, class, gender and other injustices as well as current events for subject matter. Our journalistic work will draw inspiration from Project Censored. Founded in 1976 at Sonoma State University, Project Censored is a media research program with a focus on student development of media literacy and critical thinking skills as applied to news media censorship in the U.S. The program continues to educate students and the public about the crucial role of a free press for democratic self-government.</p><p>Fall quarter, we will study and practice the fundamentals of writing effective local journalism and poetry. Winter quarter, students will choose a specific issue or theme and develop two pieces of writing - a local journalistic piece to be submitted for publication and a spoken word or literary poem to be performed at a local poetry venue. </p><p>Students who participate both quarters in good standing will have an opportunity to do internships winter quarter.</p></description>

    <description><p><span>Komm und lern Deutsch! In this first course in a year-long sequence of courses for beginning German students will cover basic grammatical concepts, vocabulary, and conversation.  Students will develop basic skills in speaking, reading, translating, and writing standard high German.  Students will also learn about culture, traditions, and customs of the German people, new and old.  Through involvement in children’s stories, music, and activities in the language laboratory, students will also become familiar with idiomatic expressions.  By the end of the year, students will improve their oral skills to the point of discussing short films and modern short stories and learning how to write a formal letter, a resumé, or a job application. Classes will use a communicative method and will move quickly toward being conducted primarily in German.</span></p></description>

    <description>This course will introduce students to the fundamentals of grant writing
and fund raising. After an orientation to contemporary philanthropy and
trends, students will learn how to increase the capacity of an 
organization to be competitive for grants and other donations.  We will 
share ways to plan realistic projects, identify promising funding 
sources and write clear and compelling components of a grant, based 
either on guidelines for an actual funder or a generic one. Working 
individually or in small groups, students will develop their project 
idea, outline the main components of a grant and prepare a brief common 
application.</description>

    <title>The Play's the Thing: Study of Theatre and Drama</title>
    <minimum_credits>16</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>16</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>Great dramatic literature is an essential component of cultural literacy. Performing plays from different historical periods creates a unique opportunity to combine theory and practice, and to simultaneously explore our history and our own identities through creative collaboration. In this two-quarter program, we will study selective great plays from the Greeks through the modern era, theater performance practices and cultural context for each text, and dramatic theory from Aristotle through Brecht and beyond. Students will learn to closely read and analyze plays, connect literature and history, and explore the relevance of historical/dramatic texts to contemporary life. Playwrights to be studied may include Euripides, Plautus, Shakespeare, Congreve, Ibsen, Chekhov, Brecht, and Beckett.</p><p>In addition, our performance studies will bring these texts to life through rigorous and disciplined practice in acting, voice, and movement. In addition to developing oral, kinetic, and corporal eloquence, these studies will help students develop the core competencies of Daniel Goleman’s Emotional Intelligence model—self-awareness, self-regulation, social skill, empathy, and motivation.</p><p>In spring quarter we will apply our learning to the production of a full-length play of historical significance for public performance. Students will explore different aspects of theater arts and learn strong collaborative skills in preparing and presenting this production.</p></description>

    <title>The Social Transformation of War in the 21st Century</title>
    <minimum_credits>16</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>16</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>The nature and practice of warfare typically reflect the sociology, technologies, and strategies of power and resistance within societies of a particular era. Today social media, such as Twitter and YouTube, is employed as weapons of war by increasingly transnational networked actors who operate in a global environment and reflect the impact of information-age global society on the practice of war.</p><p>This program will examine the social transformations of warfare in the modern period, from the rise of industrial war to new forms of asymmetrical insurgencies and networked warfare we see today, and how this reflects major sociological transformations within global society. We will explore theorists like Clausewitz, Mao, Virilio, Hardt, and Negri, among others, and examine what their theories tell us about changing forms of social organization and strategies of power and resistance across the social field. We will examine key historical turning points in the evolution of war that include Napoleon’s industrialization of warfare in Europe in the early 19th century, Maoist “people&apos;s war” in the early 20th century, and the rise of “Fourth Generation” warfare today. We will look at topical case studies such as the proliferation of drones and surveillance technologies, information warfare, and cyber-warfare, as well as historical case studies such as the recent Iraq war, Zapatista social netwar in Mexico, and the rise of networked terror insurgencies such as al-Qaida and ISIS. In all these cases, we will examine how new forms of warfare mirror broader changes in global society, such as the emergence of networked communications technologies and late capitalist economic globalization. We will learn about how the changing nature of war serves as a vector of both power and resistance.</p><p>Primary learning goals include obtaining a thorough knowledge of the modern history of war and social transformation; developing an understanding of contending theories and strategic approaches to war and social change; understanding the diversity and strategies of guerrilla and insurgent groups and their adversaries; and developing an ability to engage in critical thinking, analytical writing, and informed opinions regarding these topics.</p><p>
      The program will be organized around a series of texts, exercises, films, and assignments, including class presentations, role plays, and several analytical papers. We will watch films and documentaries to supplement our learning, including
      <em>The Battle of Algiers</em>
      ,
      <em>Body of Lies,</em><em>No Country for Old Men</em>
      , and others. This program will demand a serious commitment by students to all of the work within the program and will focus on skill development in writing, analysis, and public speaking.

    <title>Practice of Organic Farming</title>
    <minimum_credits>16</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>16</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>Do you want to produce food for yourself, your family, and others in your community? What does it take to grow food and feed yourself and others every day throughout the year? This three-quarter program (spring, summer and fall) will explore details of sustainable food production systems using the three pillars of sustainability—economic, environmental, and social justice—as our lens. Our focus will be on small-scale organic production, but we will compare and contrast that system to other production systems. We will cover the scientific underpinning of sustainable and organic food production, critical thinking, and observation skills necessary to grow food using ecologically informed methods. In addition, we will explore the farm management and business skills necessary to operate a small-scale farm.</p><p>We will be studying and working at the Evergreen Organic Farm through an entire growing season, from seed propagation to harvest, and on to market. The farm includes a small-scale direct market stand and CSA, as well as a variety of other demonstration areas. All students will work on the farm every week to gain practical experiential learning. This program is rigorous physically and academically and requires a willingness to work outside in adverse weather on a schedule determined by the needs of crops and animals.</p><p>Spring quarter we will focus on soil science, nutrient management, and crop botany. Additional topics will include introduction to animal husbandry, successional crop planning, season extension, and the principles and practice of composting. In summer, main topics will be disease and pest management, which includes entomology, plant pathology, and weed biology. Water management, irrigation system design, maximizing market and value-added opportunities, and regulatory issues will be covered. Fall&apos;s focus will be on farm and business planning, crop physiology, storage techniques, seed saving practices, and cover crops. Additional topics covered throughout the program will include record keeping for organic production systems, alternative crop production systems, techniques for adding value to farm and garden products, hand-tool use and maintenance, and farm equipment safety. We will also include communication and conflict resolution skills needed to work effectively in small groups.</p><p>
      Topics will be explored through on-farm workshops, seminar discussions, lectures and laboratory exercises, and field trips. Expect weekly reading and writing assignments, extensive collaborative group work, and a variety of hands-on projects. The final project in fall will be a detailed farm and business plan which integrates all the topics covered in the program. Books may include
      <em>Crop Planning for Organic Vegetable Growers</em>
      by Theriault and Brisebois,
      <em>Planning Workbook: Organic Whole Farm</em>
      by Huelsman,

    <title>Electronics in Music : Collaborating With Machines</title>
    <minimum_credits>4</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>4</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>In this course, students will explore methods for using technology as an active collaborator in the creation of music.  Students will develop compositions in the music technology labs while diving deep into modular synthesis, MIDI programming, creative mixing techniques and other topics.  We’ll take our conceptual and technical cues from pioneering electroacoustic composers and experimenters such as Pauline Oliveros, Brian Eno, Morton Subotnick, Laurie Spiegel, and others.  Students entering this course are expected to have some foundation in music technology, either through the “Introduction to Electronics in Music” courses or through equivalent experience.  Please contact the faculty for a course application. </p></description>

    <maximum_credits>4</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>Multitrack Composition is the study of audio technology and its role in changing the art of music composition and production. This three quarter long sequence is concerned with the use of modern recording technologies as instrument. The use of signal processing, tape/computer based manipulation, and the structure of multitrack recorders and audio consoles allow a great number of techniques to be created on the fly to generate, modify, and document musical sound. <br/><br/> Fall quarter will be spent reviewing operation, design and application of the campus facilities to gain common skill levels and technical knowledge, and complete proficiency in the Communications Building API1608 and Neve 5088 studios and associated facilities.</p><p><br/> The course is for musicians and engineers who want to develop compositional, technical and collaborative skills in modern production. This is a lab course with limited (20) positions available. Please make sure you complete an application and speak with the sponsor regarding your skills.  If you have any questions, please contact the sponsor.</p><p> </p><p> </p></description>

    <title>Where Are You? Introduction to Geography and Geographical Awareness</title>
    <minimum_credits>16</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>16</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>Ever wonder why sixth grade geography was so boring? Memorizing place names and locations is NOT geography! Join this program and learn a new way of being in the world. This program will provide an overview of geography as an academic discipline and a knowledge base that defines the uniqueness of places, regions, environmental conditions, and spatial abilities. Using a traditional geography textbook, we will cover the four main areas of geography—physical or Earth sciences, regions of the world, patterns of social organization, and basic methods of data collection and mapping techniques. We will also read a set of texts that inform the creation of landscapes of meaning, environmental awareness, and resource management in the United States. Class meeting times will be used for introductory lecture materials, seminar on texts, and field trips. The online component will include a set of assignments and inquiry-based learning.</p></description>

    <description><p>In the fall quarter, students will explore the roots of Russian language, learn to read the mysterious looking Cyrillic script, write the unique Russian cursive, construct sentences and express themselves in Russian. Students will be introduced to basic grammatical structures and vocabulary to enable them to successfully develop thematic reports in the target. From the very start, students will be immersed in the colorful cultural and historical context provided by authentic text, film, music, and visual arts. Also,  an essential component of students&apos; learning experience will be discussion of or attendance of culturally significant events.</p></description>

        How can we systematically describe and predict the motion of objects, from falling apples to orbiting moons?  This course provides an overview of the physics of motion.  Topics will include forces and acceleration, momentum, energy, and special relativity.  Conceptual understanding will be emphasized with algebra and basic trigonometry as mathematical foundations.  Laboratory exercises will involve some experimental design and will focus on developing skill in observation and analysis while reinforcing conceptual understanding. 
        <br/></span></p><p><span>While there are no prerequisites for this course, prior experience in physical science is beneficial as is a general confidence in approaching mathematical information.</span></p><p>
      Taking this course as part of a sequence with
      <em>Physics: Electromagnetism</em>
      and
      <em>Physics: Light</em><span>provides the equivalent of a standard, algebra-based, first-year physics sequence.</span></p></description>

    <description><p>Prior Learning from Experience allows people with significant professional and/or community-based experience to kick-start or accelerate a college degree.  Students receive significant support from peers and faculty in learning how to assemble a portfolio that shows the “college equivalent learning” they have gained through professional and/or community-based work.  Students earn credit through a combination of coursework and faculty evaluation of the completed essay.This separate and economical assessment and award of credit for prior learning speeds time to degree.  Students completing a PLE document generally describe the experience as “transformative,” helping them to understand the college level equivalence of their professional and community-based experience, as well as preparing them for future academic and professional work. The program has a prerequisite course, which you will find under “Writing from Life.”  You will also find further information, including a video, at <a href="http://www.evergreen.edu/eveningandweekend/priorlearning.htm">http://www.evergreen.edu/eveningweekend/ple.htm</a> .</p></description>

    <description><p>The purpose of this three-quarter program is to help students develop the skills needed to assess their communities, capture their observations, and articulate them in a useful form. Students will work to improve their skills in critical thinking, research methods, analytical reading and writing, and understanding across differences of socio-economic class, race and ethnicity. This program will support students pursuing advanced degrees or careers in the field of education, government and non-profit service organizations.</p><p>Students will work in teams as they learn research skills, participate in field activities, and keep a record of their progress through a variety of assignments, such as mapping, journaling, oral histories, and data analysis. One of the primary objectives of this program will be to give back to the communities we are studying by adding to historical internet archives, creating photo journals, stories, poems and published articles.</p><p>Our contextual focus will be the formation of communities in the “Harbor” – generally speaking the geographic region that is connected to the communities of Aberdeen, Cosmopolis and Hoquiam. Special emphasis will be given to how communities met their need for housing – from the settlement period through to current day challenges of creating affordable housing and meeting the needs of seniors, special needs populations and the homeless.</p><p>The communities of the Harbor will be our learning laboratory for our investigation into what makes communities work. We will use a multidisciplinary approach in the examination of how these communities evolved and the role that the private, public and non-profit sectors played in the development of housing as the region grew and developed.</p><p>Our examination of the history of the region will seek out answers to how past events inform the current issues in housing and community development policy that the Grays Harbor region is facing now and in the future. Students will learn how to work with primary source material and conduct research as a means of learning skills that are transferable to a broad range of social science disciplines.</p><p>Fall quarter will focus on settlement years through WWI. Students will learn primary source research skills as they collect information about the early development of the Harbor Region with a focus on natural resources based industries and meeting the needs of a growing labor force and diverse immigrant populations.</p><p>Winter quarter will focus on growth of federal and state housing programs during the boom and bust years of 1920s through 1980. Students will explore how housing programs were created as part of the welfare state of this period and examine their success and shortcomings based on research of how programs, projects and services were implemented in the Harbor Region.</p><p>Spring quarter will look at current housing challenges in the Harbor Region including an examination of issues related to affordability, homelessness and innovative approaches to meeting the needs of communities that are gripped by change influenced by local, state, national and international forces.</p></description>

    <title>History of Agriculture in Washington State (1900-1980)</title>
    <minimum_credits>4</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>4</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>Agriculture in Washington first developed during a period of agrarian revolt. Populism, in its many forms, took root in our state through political organizations such as the Grange – an agriculturally based fraternal organization that played a dominant role in the politics of the state prior to WWII. Both agriculture and politics were shaped by the replacement of the family farm with corporations controlled by national and international financial interests. The story of the industrialization of agriculture provides deep insight into the political economy of our state and helps explain how our nation’s food production and distribution system was shaped.</p></description>

    <description><p>Prior Learning from Experience allows people with significant professional and/or community-based experience to kick-start or accelerate a college degree.  Students receive significant support from peers and faculty in learning how to assemble a portfolio that shows the “college equivalent learning” they have gained through professional and/or community-based work.  Students earn credit through a combination of coursework and faculty evaluation of the completed essay.This separate and economical assessment and award of credit for prior learning speeds time to degree.  Students completing a PLE document generally describe the experience as “transformative,” helping them to understand the college level equivalence of their professional and community-based experience, as well as preparing them for future academic and professional work. The program has a prerequisite course, which you will find under “Writing from Life.”  You will also find further information, including a video, at <a href="http://www.evergreen.edu/eveningandweekend/priorlearning.htm">http://www.evergreen.edu/eveningweekend/ple.htm</a> .</p></description>

    <description>Doing well while doing good is a challenge.  Whereas some kind of help 
is the kind of help that helps, some kind of help we can do without.  
Gaining wisdom to know the paths of skillful helping of self and others 
is the focus of this four-credit course.  We will explore knowing who we
are, identifying caring as a moral attitude, relating wisely to others,
maintaining trust, and working together to make change possible.</description>

    <description>We will explore the intersection where valued health care meets paid health care. In the health care arena, good intent is plagued by paradox and can yield under-funding and a mismatch with initial intent. Paradoxes and costs haunting prevention, access, and treatment will be reviewed. The books
    <em>Redefining Health Care</em>
    and
    <em>The New Health Care System</em>
     aid our journey as will the video series, &quot;Remaking American Medicine&quot;, &quot;Sick Around the World,&quot; and &quot;Sick Around America&quot;. We will consider the path of unintended consequences where piles of dollars are not the full answer to identified need.</description>

    <description><p>Prior Learning from Experience allows people with significant professional and/or community-based experience to kick-start or accelerate a college degree.  Students receive significant support from peers and faculty in learning how to assemble a portfolio that shows the “college equivalent learning” they have gained through professional and/or community-based work.  Students earn credit through a combination of coursework and faculty evaluation of the completed essay.This separate and economical assessment and award of credit for prior learning speeds time to degree.  Students completing a PLE document generally describe the experience as “transformative,” helping them to understand the college level equivalence of their professional and community-based experience, as well as preparing them for future academic and professional work. The program has a prerequisite course, which you will find under “Writing from Life.”  You will also find further information, including a video, at <a href="http://www.evergreen.edu/eveningandweekend/priorlearning.htm">http://www.evergreen.edu/eveningweekend/ple.htm</a> .</p></description>

    <maximum_credits>4</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>This year-long sequence of courses covers the first year of Spanish. </p><p>Have you wanted to learn Spanish so you can communicate face-to-face when you take that long-dreamed of trip to the sunny beaches of Mexico, Central or South America?   Have you noticed that you hear more Spanish being spoken in the various community locations you frequent such as grocery, hardware and department stores?   Are you curious about the culture of the people that now constitute the largest ethnic minority in the United States?  Have you come to the conclusion that being able to communicate in Spanish would greatly increase your professional or academic flexibility and value?  Did you study Spanish previously and want to “brush up” on your skills? Any and all of these are excellent reasons to study Spanish, and one of the Spanish classes offered at Evergreen will meet your needs.</p><p>You may need to start with Beginning Spanish I  if you have little or no experience with learning the language or if your previous experience with studying the language was some years ago.   </p><p>Classes are highly interactive, safe environments to practice your new skills.   A wide range of learning activities is provided so that students learn to read, write, speak and understand the language.   Students use a written text and workbook for self-study.   An online learning vehicle is also used so that students are immersed in the various components of the language.   Students have access to a language lab that incorporates Rosetta Stone for additional practice.   Cultural activities are integrated into the classes so that students learn not only the language but also the major cultural values and traditions of countries where Spanish is spoken.   A culminating language fair is held during spring quarter in conjunction with other language classes and provides language students with opportunities to display their own learning as well as learn about the other cultures represented by those languages.   Come join us and begin expanding your world – present and future!</p><p>The following is a short description of the material covered in each of the Beginning Spanish classes:</p><p>Beginning Spanish I: Beginning Spanish I students acquire the skills to understand written and oral language and to express themselves in written and oral language about the following: greetings, introductions, expressions of courtesy, academic life, days of the week, schedules, family, identifying and describing people, professions and occupations, leisure activities, sports, asking for and giving directions within a city or campus, travel and vacation arrangements and activities, months and seasons of the year and weather.    Students acquire the following grammatical structures: use of the verbs <em>hay</em> and <em>gustar</em> , conjugation of verbs in the present tense including stem-changing verbs, <em>ser</em> and <em>estar</em> , noun/adjective agreement, subject/verb agreement, and various idiomatic expressions related to the topics studied.</p><p>Beginning Spanish II: Beginning Spanish II students acquire the skills to understand written and oral language and to express themselves in written and oral language about the following: vacations and other free time activities, months of the year, seasons and weather, clothing and shopping, negotiating a price and buying, colors, daily routines and time expressions, food and meals.   Students acquire the following grammatical structures: use of the reflexive mood and preterit tense, including verbs <em>ser</em> and <em>ir</em> in the preterit, demonstrative pronouns, direct and indirect object pronouns, and various idiomatic expressions related to the topics studied.</p><p>Beginning Spanish III: Beginning Spanish III students continue to build their knowledge base of the foundational communicative structures, including: use of reflexive verbs, indefinite and negative words, preterite of irregular and stem-changing verbs, double object pronouns, the imperfect tense, contrasting uses and meanings of preterite and imperfect tenses, familiar and formal commands, and the present subjunctive.   These structures are acquired while communicating about the following: describing one’s daily personal hygiene and life routines, shopping for and describing food and preparing meals, parties and celebrations, family relationships and stages of life, identifying parts of the body and symptoms and medical conditions to obtain medical assistance and daily domestic chores and routines.</p></description>

    <minimum_credits>4</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>4</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>This course is envisioned to aid active duty, veterans and dependents in adjusting to a college environment and to provide them with an orientation to the tools that are available to help them adjust. We will use a seminar format, where class members discuss issues confronting their re-entry into the civilian community, particularly an academic environment. Through reading and research, you will discover effective tools and strategies for dealing with those challenges. The class will feature short lectures and films on various topics, followed by discussions. Students will read the novel,  <em>Catch -22,</em> and discuss it, do a team research project, resulting in a paper and presentation, and write short essays on various topics. You will interact with guest lecturers, share your discoveries with classmates, and keep a<span style="line-height: 1.5em;"> journal of your feelings, emotions and observations over the length of the quarter. Credit will be awarded in research methods and in descriptive, expository, and creative writing.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">The faculty member, Thomas R.

    <title>Commodities, Conflict, and Cooperation</title>
    <minimum_credits>16</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>16</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>This program examines how the capitalist drive to extract commodities stokes divisions among cultural communities and deepens their differences and conflicts, as well as how those communities can and have come together to defend common ground. In our inquiry we will use multiple disciplinary and interdisciplinary lenses, including political economy, geography, ethnic and racial studies, political science, sociology, political ecology, feminist economics, literature, and cultural studies.</p><p>The program will explore the creative tension between particularism (which emphasizes the autonomy of different identities such as race, ethnicity, or religion) and universalism (which emphasizes unity around similar identities such as social class or the environment). The class will also examine the related interaction between corporate globalization from above (involving cultural homogenization and dividing communities) and grassroots globalization from below (stitching together place-based social movements and cultural communities).</p><p>The program will review case studies where the quest to control commodities such as crops, minerals, energy, and labor contributes to ethnic, racial, or religious conflicts as well as cooperation. Fall quarter we will focus on North American cases, such as the origins of racial slavery and the white race in relation to early colonial tobacco plantations; treaty rights struggles of indigenous nations over access to fish and water; and the use of migrant labor from Latin America in fruit fields and orchards. We will review examples of conflicts that led to unlikely alliances between former enemies and redefined the meanings of commodities beyond mere economic purpose. Winter quarter we will compare and contrast North American case studies in other parts of the colonized world, such as the ethnic and sectarian conflicts that divide the oil-rich Middle East, the forested tribal territories of South Asia, and the heartland of corn and chocolate in Mexico. We will draw parallels between domestic and overseas resource wars generated by the same global capitalist systems and link processes of decolonization at home and abroad. We we examine how changing labor markets have shifted gender roles and relations. In general the program will stress community-based learning both within and outside the walls of academia through group work and the use of field trips, field work, guest speakers, and visual depictions of people and places.

    <maximum_credits>4</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>
      This course is envisioned to aid active duty, veterans and dependents in adjusting to a college environment and to provide them with an orientation to the tools that are available to help them adjust. We will use a seminar format, where class members discuss issues confronting their re-entry into the civilian community, particularly an academic environment. Through reading and research, you will discover effective tools and strategies for dealing with those challenges. The class will feature short lectures and films on various topics, followed by discussions. Students will read the novel,  
      <em>Catch -22,</em>
      and discuss it, do a team research project, resulting in a paper and presentation, and write short essays on various topics. You will interact with guest lecturers, share your discoveries with classmates, and keep a
      <span style="line-height: 1.5em;"> journal of your feelings, emotions and observations over the length of the quarter. Credit will be awarded in research methods and in descriptive, expository, and creative writing.</span></p><p> </p><p> </p></description>

    <title>Writing from Life</title>
    <minimum_credits>4</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>4</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>The Writing from Life class serves two distinct groups of students -- those planning to earn credit through Prior Learning from Experience, and those who want to build their skills in creative writing.</p><p><em>Prior Learning from Experience Prerequisite:</em>
       Students will have the chance to kick-start, or accelerate, a college career by documenting professional and/or community-based experience. With significant support, they will learn to write essays that show the &quot;college equivalent learning&quot; they have gained through professional and/or volunteer work in community. Writing from Life is the springboard to this highly supportive learning community, where adults work together to ensure one another&apos;s success.  Students headed toward PLE will receive significant faculty support, both one-on-one, and in class.  We will also focus on academic skills that will help students to succeed in Prior Learning and in other academic courses and programs at Evergreen.  Students earn four credits for this course, and may take up to 16 further credits in the Prior Learning from Experience Program.  The Prior Learning prerequisite requires an easily-obtained faculty signature.  Please attend the academic fair for the quarter you would like to attend (contact Admissions), and/or contact Nancy A. Parkes at 
      <a href="mailto:parkesn@evergreen.edu">parkesn@evergreen.edu</a>
      . You will also find further information, including a video, at  http://www.evergreen.edu/eveningweekend/ple.htm.
    </p><p> </p><p><em>Creative and Effective Writing:</em>
      A group of up to eight students will concentrate on autobiography, essays, and writing of choice. They will participate with future Prior Learning from Experience students in reading and seminars on texts and essays, as well as writing workshops.  Students in this section don&apos;t require a faculty signature to register, but must be highly capable of independent work.

    <minimum_credits>16</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>16</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>This SOS program provides an opportunity for students to work on larger, highly collaborative projects that require a multiplicity of skills and knowledge that individuals may not possess on their own. In this two-quarter program, students will form their own learning communities in order to work collectively and collaboratively on a project of common interest. For example, students could organize as political activists and work for a political campaign or on a political issue, rehearse and perform a play or musical, or write and produce a film. Students could also create a business plan and take steps to open their own business, write and perform a comedy sketch show, create an improv performance troupe, or contribute daily work to an ongoing charity such as Habitat for Humanity. There are countless possibilities, limited only by one&apos;s interests and imagination. The most important aspect in the selection of a project is the recognition that the size and scope of the work requires the commitment of more than one individual and is possible only with the creation of a learning community.  </p><p>Faculty will support student work through regular meetings, critiques, and problem-solving discussions. The peer learning community will also provide support and direction for the various projects</p></description>

    <title>Writing from Life</title>
    <minimum_credits>4</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>4</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>The Writing from Life class serves two distinct groups of students -- those planning to earn credit through Prior Learning from Experience, and those who want to build their skills in creative writing.</p><p><em>Prior Learning from Experience Prerequisite:</em>  Students will have the chance to kick-start, or accelerate, a college career by documenting professional and/or community-based experience. With significant support, they will learn to write essays that show the &quot;college equivalent learning&quot; they have gained through professional and/or volunteer work in community. Writing from Life is the springboard to this highly supportive learning community, where adults work together to ensure one another&apos;s success.  Students headed toward PLE will receive significant faculty support, both one-on-one, and in class.  We will also focus on academic skills that will help students to succeed in Prior Learning and in other academic courses and programs at Evergreen.  Students earn four credits for this course, and may take up to 16 further credits in the Prior Learning from Experience Program.  The Prior Learning prerequisite requires an easily-obtained faculty signature.  Please attend the academic fair for the quarter you would like to attend (contact Admissions), and/or contact Nancy A. Parkes at  <a href="mailto:parkesn@evergreen.edu">parkesn@evergreen.edu</a> . You will also find further information, including a video, at  http://www.evergreen.edu/eveningweekend/ple.htm.</p><p> </p><p><em>Creative and Effective Writing:</em> A group of up to eight students will concentrate on autobiography, essays, and writing of choice. They will participate with future Prior Learning from Experience students in reading and seminars on texts and essays, as well as writing workshops.  Students in this section don&apos;t require a faculty signature to register, but must be highly capable of independent work.<span style="line-height: 1.5em;"><br/></span></p><p> </p><p> </p></description>

    <description><p>
      This program is intended for students committed to activism, allyship, and praxis. We’ll study the scholarship of John Mohawk, posing essential questions to understand the current state of the world and how to survive as both individuals and as peoples. We’ll study world history, United States history, and regional histories of the United States in terms of the doctrine of discovery, sovereignty, self-governance, conflict resolution, land and economics, health and reproduction, education and socialization of children, and political philosophy. Using the river of culture template highlighting laws and policies impacting the lived experience of American Indians, students will conduct research. In this research, students will pose and respond to essential questions about contemporary issues that continue to deprive American Indians of land, economic opportunities, treaty rights, natural resources, religious freedom, repatriation, and access to and protection for sacred places. We will look at the history behind the headlines, track contemporary resistance phenomenon like the Idle No More global movement, conduct ethnographic interviewing highlighting personal stories that can’t be gleaned from text, look up alternative sources
      <i>(Ethnic NewsWatch</i>
      and
      <i>Indian Country Today),</i>
      search Washington State Historical Society’s clipping files, tribal photo files, and rare document rooms at historical museums. Students will interview tribal activists and read novels and poetry that tell stories of resistance in a personal way. 
    </p><p>During fall and winter quarters U.S. history will be studied in terms of the doctrine of discovery, steps of colonization, and court recognition and enforcement of the Indian tribes’ legal, political, property, and cultural rights as indigenous peoples. Lectures, films, readings, seminars, and student-led, text-based seminars will compose the primary structures used by this learning community. Students will propose an academic project using an essential question format, report out findings, and write up their research. Groups will write for newspapers they generate and distribute to local Indian tribes. Introduction to art therapy, reclaiming of art traditions and protocols, and participation in the liberation theater component of the program requires students to make art products to extend their learning/leadership when the program hosts Generations Rising/Tribal Youth Make Art day and students volunteer at the art stations (an annual event sponsored by our program with the Longhouse staff and the Hazel Pete Institute of Chehalis Basketry). Liberation theater is a readers theater group that welcomes visitors to a program hosted by the Longhouse Education and Cultural Center. Students will have an opportunity to volunteer to assist with the making of art items (“potlatching”) for tribes in the Puget Sound area getting ready to participate in the “Paddle to Sliammon First Nation in 2017” at Campbell River, B.C., Canada. The Tribal Canoe Journey was formally organized in 1989 when the “Paddle to Seattle” was initiated during the 100th anniversary of Washington statehood. Local tribes, including Nisqually, Skokomish, Squaxin Island, and Chehalis, typically participate in the journeys.</p><p>Students will engage in program service-learning volunteer projects, environmental stewardship, and program internships during winter and spring quarters. Spring quarter, students will begin a formal presentation of their research and program time will focus on program themes examining contemporary issues. All students will participate in orientation(s) to the program theme and issues, historic and political frameworks, and work respectfully with communities and organizations. Participation in this program means practicing accountability to the learning community, other communities, interacting as a respectful guest with other cultures, and engaging in constant cross-cultural communication with co-learners.</p></description>

    <title>Hacking Human Nature</title>
    <minimum_credits>16</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>16</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>We have arrived at a defining moment for our species. Humans have raced competitively around the globe, we have leveraged technology to increase our numbers, and we have innovated unsustainable and wildly unfair patterns of consumption. The facts of our predicament will force massive and arbitrary changes upon all humanity if we do not come together to design a wise and self-correcting replacement system first.</p><p>Given the above, this program will focus on several related questions:</p><ul><li>What is the evolutionary nature of humans, and how did it produce our present predicament?</li><li>What does our evolutionary nature say about the range of viable futures?</li><li>Given the range of what’s possible, what type of future is most desirable?</li><li>What is the best hope of making the transition?</li></ul><p>This program will not be presented at the front of the room and consumed by the audience. It will emerge from the combined efforts, knowledge, and wisdom of all program participants. It is appropriate to self-motivated students who are open to the idea that massive changes are inevitable, whether humans design them or not. Passive students are likely to feel adrift in this program, just as self-motivated students are energized. A science background is not required, but acceptance of a broad and inclusive scientific worldview is essential.</p><p>There will be lectures, readings, and student projects. We will go on two week-long retreats where hiking will occur daily. Students should expect this program to absorb a great deal of time and attention, well beyond the in-class schedule and formal assignments.     </p></description>

    <description>Accompanied by live drumming, we will learn dances originating in Africa
and migrating to Brazil during slavery. We will dance to the driving, 
rapturous beat from Brazil known as samba. For the people of the 
villages surrounding Rio de Janeiro, samba is considered their most 
intense, unambivalent joy. In addition, we will dance and sing to 
contemporary cross-cultural beat from Bahia: Samba-Reggae and the 
Candomble religious dances of the Orixas. We will also learn dances from
other regions of Brazil, such as Baiao, Frevo and Maracatu.</description>

    <title>Reading Rocks:  Geology and Art in the Pacific Northwest</title>
    <minimum_credits>16</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>16</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>This program offers an introductory study of physical geology and art through the lens of the Pacific Northwest.</p><p>Geologic time and evidence of the Earth&apos;s dynamic past are recorded in rocks, minerals, and biologic materials in the landscape. What forces have shaped the geology of the Pacific Northwest? Where did these rocks, minerals, and organisms come from and how are they changing? These questions have fascinated people for centuries. Both scientists and artists rely heavily on skills of observation and description to understand the world, and to convey that understanding to others. Geologists use images, diagrams, and figures to illustrate concepts and communicate research. Artists take scientific information to inform their work and seek to communicate the implications of what science tells us about the world. They also draw on scientific concepts as metaphors for autobiographical artworks.</p><p>We will use science and art to study basic concepts in earth science, including geologic time, plate tectonics, and minerals and rocks before shifting to soil formation, the hydrological cycle, and climate. Case studies in the Cascade mountain range and field trips to the Olympic Peninsula and Nisqually Watershed will provide hands-on experience.</p><p>Students will learn basic techniques in observational drawing and watercolor painting. They will learn the discipline of keeping illustrated field journals to inform their studies of geological processes. They will also develop finished artworks ranging from scientific illustration to personal expression.</p></description>

    <title>Arts and the Child: Early Childhood</title>
    <minimum_credits>4</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>4</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>All children enjoy singing, painting, and dancing. Yet, as we grow up, this natural ability becomes suppressed and often lost.  This course will reach out to the inner child in students and provide opportunities to support children in need of care and education in the community. Lectures, studio arts, research, field trips and volunteer work with children in the community will develop students’ competency as artists, parents, and educators. The course will also examine practices of education and self-cultivation from Eastern and Western perspectives. Our study will focus on children of preschool age, 0-6 years old.</p><p>Credit will be awarded in arts and human development.</p></description>

    <title>Awakening the Leader Within</title>
    <minimum_credits>4</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>4</maximum_credits>
    <description><p><span>We need a new generation of leaders and game-changers.  The notion of leadership that once resonated with greatness no longer inspires new dreams, compelling visions, and revolutionary actions.  The unethical behavior, self-indulging decisions, and ego-driven conduct of many contemporary leaders has eroded the society’s trust in corporate, public and political leaders.  There is an urgent need for conscious and principled leaders who are driven by a set of universal virtues, a strong moral compass, and a deep desire to serve a global society and a sustainable world.  This course teaches students critical concepts and skills to examine their passion and purpose, develop vision, mission, values, and a plan of action to serve their communities.  This course provides students with the opportunity to reflect, collaborate, and learn through individual and group activities including self-evaluation, cases, discussions and seminars, and team projects. </span></p></description>

    <title>Pacific Rim Rivals:  China, Russia, Japan and the United States</title>
    <minimum_credits>8</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>8</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>
      China has become a world power ambitious to expand its political and economic influence not only in Asia, but across the globe. China&apos;s commercial and political inroads in Africa are so great that some have called it
      <em>China’s Second</em><em>Continent</em>
      .  Meanwhile, American policy makers have signaled a shift in U. S. vital interests from Europe and the Middle East to the Pacific Rim and East Asia.  Already the United States and its Pacific allies are in conflict with a more aggressive and robust China over the control of the South China Sea.
    </p><p>At the same time, Russia is testing the limits of its power not only in the European East, but through expansion of air and naval forces in the western Pacific region.  Add to this Japan&apos;s recent &quot;improbable military resurgence,&quot; and it is easy to conclude that a new era of conflict is at hand.</p><p>But viewed historically, the current Pacific rivalry is only the latest version of &quot;great powers&quot; politics that have deep roots in the aggressive and expansive policies of these nation-states, going back to the late nineteenth century. Knowledge of these ongoing rivalries will help us understand how regional international relations in the Pacific Rim have developed and how they might unfold--hopefully short of global war--but certainly with new socioeconomic and cultural consequences.</p><p>This program will explore the complex imperial international relations between the United States, Japan, China, and Russia in the twentieth century and the legacies of those conflicts and negotiations in today&apos;s world. How did these geo-political rivalries help foment and shape the Chinese Revolution and the emergence of modern China as a global power?  Is Japan seeking to recover some of its pre-war imperial might?  How is Russia seeking to exert itself more than a quarter century after the collapse of the Soviet Union, and how is the United States reacting? </p><p>Against this background of ongoing imperial rivalries, we will examine in detail the history of Revolutionary China from 1911 and culminating with the Chinese Communist Revolution of 1949.  We will also cover the global Cold War between China, the United States and the Soviet Union (Soviet Russia) and its impacts on national liberation movements in Southeast Asia and the emergence of China as an expanding world historical political economic power in the late twentieth century. This program will be of great interest to any students of history, geography, geopolitics, political economy, and anyone interested in Chinese, Russian, Japanese or American studies. </p></description>

    <description><p><span>Komm und lern Deutsch! In this second course of a year-long sequence of courses for beginning German students will cover basic grammatical concepts, vocabulary, and conversation.  Students will develop basic skills in speaking, reading, translating, and writing standard high German.  Students will also learn about culture, traditions, and customs of the German people, new and old.  Through involvement in children’s stories, music, and activities in the language laboratory, students will also become familiar with idiomatic expressions.  By the end of the year, students will improve their oral skills to the point of discussing short films and modern short stories and learning how to write a formal letter, a resumé, or a job application. Classes will use a communicative method and will move quickly toward being conducted primarily in German.Taught by a NATIVE SPEAKER.</span></p></description>

    <minimum_credits>4</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>4</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>From serialism to chance music, musical dice games to change-ringing, musicians have often found methods of creating music that rely on external processes.  In this course, students will work extensively with Max/MSP, a visual programming environment, to develop algorithms and generative processes for creating music.  Students will learn how musical ideas can be expressed and manipulated using numbers, simple math, and logic.  Students entering this course are expected to have some foundation in music and/or music technology, either through the “Introduction to Electronics in Music” courses or equivalent experience.  Preference is given to students continuing from the fall quarter of “Electronics in Music.”  Please contact the instructor for a course application. </p></description>

    <maximum_credits>4</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>Multitrack Composition is the study of audio technology and its role in changing the art of music composition and production. This three quarter long sequence is concerned with the use of modern recording technologies as instrument. The use of signal processing, tape/computer based manipulation, and the structure of multitrack recorders and audio consoles allow a great number of techniques to be created on the fly to generate, modify, and document musical sound.</p><p><br/> The course is for musicians and engineers who want to develop compositional, technical and collaborative skills in modern production. This is a lab course with limited (20) positions available. Please make sure you complete an application and speak with the faculty regarding your skills.  If you have any questions, please contact the faculty.</p><p> </p></description>

    <description><p>Fungi. What are they? Where are they and what roles do they play in terrestrial ecosystems? How do they get their energy? How do they grow? What do they taste like? How do they interact with other organisms? This program will focus on understanding these unique and pivotal organisms through exploring the taxonomy, ecology, biology and physiology of fungi and lichens.</p><p>Our program time will consist of field work, laboratory work, lectures, workshops and seminars. There will also be one-day field trips and two multi-day field trips. There will be an emphasis on learning relevant field methods to assess biodiversity of lichens and fungi, along with developing the laboratory skills to identify lichens and mushrooms using chemical and microscopic techniques. Students will also learn methods for isolating and growing fungi. We will expect students to research topics in the primary scientific literature and to summarize and share their findings with the entire class. There will be opportunities for independent directed work, both individually and in small groups. Students will also have the chance to further their skills in technical writing, library research, critical thinking and public presentations.</p><p>If you are a student with a disability and would like to request accommodations, please contact the faculty or the office of Access Services (Library Bldg. Rm. 2153, PH: 360.867.6348; TTY 360.867.6834) prior to the start of the quarter. If you require accessible transportation for field trips, please contact the faculty well in advance of the field trip dates to allow time to arrange this.</p></description>

    <title>Natural History and Storytelling: Observations and Representations</title>
    <minimum_credits>8</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>8</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>This program will help students gain fluidity as readers and writers of science. They will be able to evaluate the quality of science writing found in the mainstream and specialty media, and among poetry circles. Students will appreciate the importance of natural history writing to everyone’s health and well-being by connecting with our environment.</p><p>Natural history is the scientific study of animals and plants, especially based on observation rather than experimentation. Through storytelling, we will consider how natural history helps us understand the living world and travel the byways of our past, present and future. Crucial personal and public decisions must be based on good scientific research, and effective science writing is often the catalyst between scientists, the public, and policy makers.</p><p>We will consider what science is and how it works, explore natural history, including that of the Pacific Northwest, and work toward developing a scientific perspective on some current major issues, such as global climate change. We will work toward developing skills to communicate information and concepts using verbal and graphic representations and equation</p><p>Science writers work in various genres – scientific papers, spoken word and literary poetry, and journalism – that are fascinating and engage audiences such as the scientific community, general public, and poetry lovers. Science writers of today –  scientists, journalists, poets – are making it possible for the public to engage with critical issues, such as climate change, health equity, food sustainability, environmental justice, and systems of privilege and inequity built into these debates.  In this hands-on, writing-intensive program we will explore the import and versatility of science writing and reading through abstracts, journalism and poetry within the framework of natural history.</p><p>Assignments may include writing: 1) an article abstract suitable for a scientific journal 2) a journalistic article based on attending a local public policy meeting or hearing, live interviews and additional research, 3) a discussion of a topic in science accessible to an educated public, 4) spoken word or literary poetry for stage and page using natural history as a framework and/or theme, as well as illustrated field journals. Students may also track and critique natural history articles in a variety of mainstream, alternative, and specialty media for effective communication of science appropriate to various audiences. Activities will include lectures, workshops, seminars and field trips.</p><p>Required readings may include Charles Darwin&apos;s <em>Voyage of the Beagle,</em> Jon Luoma&apos;s <em>The Hidden Forest: Biography of an Ecosystem, </em>works by Mary Oliver and John Muir, and science articles written for popular and professional audiences.</p><p>This program will serve as a foundation for advanced study or work in natural history, science writing, journalism, poetry, communication, nonprofits, government and education.</p><p> </p><p> </p></description>

    <maximum_credits>4</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>This course continues a sequence of courses introduing the subject of audio production and its relation to modern media.  In Fall quarter we focused on analog mixers and magnetic recording with some work in digital editing. Main topics included field recording, digital audio editing, microphone design and application, analog multi-track recording, and audio console signal flow.  Winter continues this work while starting to work with computer-based multitrack production. Additional topics will include acoustics, reverb, and digital effects processing. Students will have weekly reading assignments and weekly lab assignments outside of class time.</p></description>

    <title>Dimensions of Inequality and Options for Change</title>
    <minimum_credits>8</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>8</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>Concern over the rise of economic inequality has grown over the last several decades as the gap between upper-income Americans and everyone else has grown wider. Much of the writing on inequality by economists has focused on the quantitative aspects: which deciles or centiles of the population get what percentage of income or wealth? This work tends to look at society as an undifferentiated mass of individuals but there are other dimensions of inequality such as race, gender, immigration status, geography, culture and family that interact with the economic dimensions and with each other. How to address all of these factors together is more complex (and maddening) than addressing each of them on their own: affirmative action and/or redistributive economic policies and/or improved public education and/or investments in public infrastructure in general.<br/><br/> In the first quarter of the program we will review the recent work on economic inequality by leading economists and then look at other research that further breaks down the distribution of wealth and income by the other societal dimensions. Spring quarter will focus on policy options to reduce inequality such as affirmative action and anti-discrimination laws. We will also look at taxation and budgets in order to understand how the way governments raise and disburse money affects inequality. In addition to readings in economics, politics and public policy we will also consider philosophical questions about how to prioritize the needs of all of the disadvantaged.<br/><br/> Students will learn to go beyond slogans by learning to think quantitatively about emotionally charged issues. The program will serve as context for students to increase their quantitative thinking skills through a study of statistics. Students who successfully complete the full two-quarter program will complete studies and earn credit equivalent to a standard first-quarter statistics course. With these skills in hand, students can then begin to evaluate policy proposals that attempt to mitigate inequality from both an analytic and a political perspective.</p></description>

    <maximum_credits>16</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>This rigorous program will focus on investigations in hydrogeology and biology supported with analytical chemistry. Instrumental techniques and chemical analysis skills will be developed in an advanced laboratory. The expectation is that students will learn how to conduct accurate chemical, ecological, and hydrogeological measurements in order to define baseline assessments of natural ecosystems and determine environmental function and/or contamination. Quantitative analysis, quality control procedures, research design, and technical writing will be emphasized.</p><p>The program will start with a two-week field trip to Yellowstone National Park that will introduce students to the regional geology of the Columbia River Plateau, Snake River, Rocky Mountains, and the Yellowstone Hotspot. Issues of water quality, hydrothermal systems, extremophilic organisms, and ecosystem diversity will also be studied during the trip.</p><p>Fall and winter quarters we will address topics in hydrogeology, geochemistry, microbiology, molecular biology, freshwater ecology, genetics, biochemistry, analytical chemistry, GIS, and instrumental methods of chemical analysis. Students will participate in group projects studying aqueous chemistry, hydrology, and the roles of biological organisms in the nutrient cycling processes of local watersheds. Analytical procedures based on EPA, USGS, and other guidelines will be used to measure major and trace anion and cation concentrations. Molecular methods and biochemical assays will complement more classical procedures in determining biodiversity and the role of specific organisms within an ecosystem. Computers and statistical methods will be used extensively for data analysis and simulation, and GIS will be used as a tool to assess spatial data. Spring quarter will be devoted to extensive project work continuing from fall and winter. There will be a five-day field trip to eastern Washington. Presentation of project results in both oral and written form will conclude the year.</p></description>

    <title>Foundations of Washington State's Governance System</title>
    <minimum_credits>4</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>4</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>Washington State’s local governance system was forged during two of our nation’s great mass democratic political actions – the Populist and Progressive movements. The cultural, economic and political forces that informed our state’s creation and development provide insight into how social movements develop and what factors contribute to their success and failure. Students will engage in primary source research of events that occurred following Washington’s territorial years to just prior to World War I. Class sessions will be interactive, combining presentations by the instructor and guests with seminar discussions. Learning objectives include developing student&apos;s critical thinking and writing skills.</p></description>

    <title>Toward Becoming a Teacher</title>
    <minimum_credits>4</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>4</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>Many idealistic, well-intentioned new teachers find themselves frustrated by their early experiences in public schools and soon leave public education entirely. This frustration is not inevitable. This course, taught by an Evergreen graduate with more than 30 years’ experience teaching in public schools, will explore the skills needed to become a passionate, effective teacher in the 21st century. We will investigate some of the inevitable struggles—both political and personal—that teachers encounter in public schools today, and we will hear how passionate teachers overcome those tensions. This course may be of particular interest to upper-division students who are considering careers in education, but will also interest any student who wishes to look closely at issues in public education today. As part of this course, students who plan to apply to the Master in Teaching program can begin the classroom observations required for application.</p></description>

    <title>Community Resilience: Women Making Change</title>
    <minimum_credits>8</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>8</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>Resilient communities depend on relationships of trust and respect between their members. Our attention in <em>Community Resilience: Women Making Change</em> will focus on women’s experiences of organizing and acting for racial and gender equity. We will celebrate the public accomplishments of successful advocates, and consider how best to continue to work for change. An introduction to public policy and its role in shaping lives will provide context for our considerations.</p><p>Resilience can be thought of as capacity for learning and for response to change. Writings arising from advocacy work for women’s equity form one record of U.S. society’s social resilience. Program texts will be drawn from U.S. women’s, feminist, and womanist writings from the 1840s, 1970s, and the 1990s and 2000s. These texts encompass four types of writing: history, poetry, the prose of public policies, and creative nonfiction. (Creative nonfiction is factual writing combining accounts of personal experience with more abstract or theoretical thinking.) Women working for change have long relied on crafting and reading poetry and creative nonfiction, in particular, as ways to acknowledge where women stand in the world and where and how they might move forward. History and public policy are important centers of work for social justice and equity – history as a record of human effort, and public policy as one guide for, and path of, action.   </p><p>Participants in this program will have opportunities to develop the habits of mind of analytic, creative, and resilient thinkers who work with others to create life-affirming choices. Our work to develop skills in research, in clear and thoughtful speaking, in idea-based creative nonfiction writing, and in cultivating a culture of resilience and relationship-building across the significant human differences apparent in any community will be essential components of our work together.</p><p>Credit will be awarded in writing and women&apos;s studies.</p><p><em>Community Resilience: Women Making Change </em>can be taken as a one-quarter program. It is also linked to the Spring quarter program<em> Community Resilience: Social Equity and Environmental Issues</em>.<font face="Calibri"><br/></font></p></description>

    <description><p>This program follows from the fall quarter program, Community Resilience: Olympia&apos;s Capital Lake. This program will provide students with the opportunity to develop greater depth and breadth in their research work that they began in fall quarter. Students may work individually or in small groups. Fieldwork is encouraged. The student projects should have local implications, and should be placed in the context of larger environmental issues (e.g., global climate change, biodiversity loss, invasive species, disruption of ecosystem processes). We will meet regularly to discuss the progress of the research work, and have lectures, workshops, and seminars on topics and readings relevant to the program work.</p></description>

    <title>Adaptation: Evolutionary Patterns in Biological Space-Time</title>
    <minimum_credits>16</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>16</maximum_credits>
    <description><p class="p1"><span class="s1">The vast majority of complexity in the observable universe is due to one process—selection, or the tendency for some patterns to out-compete alternatives for either resources, mates, or both. And though the basics of evolutionary selection can be summarized in a single phrase (&quot;survival of the fittest&quot;), details and diversity of patterns are surprising in the extreme, raising profound questions at every juncture. For example, why has a simple, shared drive to increase reproductive success taken aardvarks and spruce trees in such different directions? And why would a peahen choose to burden her sons with a giant handicap to their movement by mating with a peacock carrying genes for a massive tail?</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">We will take a broad approach to selection, studying what is known but focusing on that which remains mysterious. The adaptive interplay between genetic, epigenetic (regulatory), and cultural traits will be of particular interest. We will also place special emphasis on understanding the tension between selection exerted by mates and that exerted by environmental factors.</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Fall quarter will be spent constructing a basic toolkit for evolutionary analysis: What is an adaptation and how can it be recognized? How can we infer function? What is the relationship between a trait&apos;s short- and long-term adaptive value? We will scrutinize structures, behaviors, and patterns found in the wild, and refine our ability to understand them through the language of game theory. Winter quarter we will focus on pushing our model of selection to its limits and beyond by applying it to the most complex and surprising adaptive patterns in nature, with a special emphasis on adaptive patterns manifest in <i>Homo sapiens</i>.</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1"> We will read books and articles, have lecture, and engage in detailed discussions. Discussions will be central to our work. Students will be expected to generate and defend hypotheses and predictions in a supportive and rigorous environment. We will go out and look at nature directly when conditions are right. There will be assignments, but the program will be primarily about generating deep predictive insight, not about producing a large volume of work. It is best suited to self-motivated students with a deep commitment to comprehending that which is knowable, but unknown. <span class="s1">This program will focus on how to think, not what to think.</span></span></p></description>

Students will be required to complete assignments from their text and workbook, pass tests, and write and present thematic reports. Additionally, students will attempt to read, analyze and memorize selected works of Russian poets. To maximize the learning experience, the class will be constantly immersed in a colorful cultural context, and have field trips to the Russian Orthodox Church and a Russian Community Center in Seattle.</p></description>

    <title>Consciousness, Dreams, and Beliefs: The Nature of Personal Reality</title>
    <minimum_credits>16</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>16</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>In this interdisciplinary program, we will focus on advanced topics in consciousness studies and the psychology of dreams. We’ll explore consciousness by examining dreams and personal belief systems using both scientific research and first-person experience. We’ll explore dynamics of the psyche by examining the following questions.  What is the psyche, what is consciousness, and what are their properties and dynamics? Are there different types of consciousness?  What is the relationship between unconscious and conscious mental processes? What is the relationship among the conscious, unconscious, and personal beliefs in constructing our sense of self and our experience individually and en masse? </p><p>Fall quarter we’ll consider consciousness and dreams from a variety of viewpoints. In addition to the third-person approach of our texts and lectures, students will explore the topics by keeping structured journals of their first-person experiences and dreams. Winter quarter we’ll continue with a more in-depth analysis of these topics and the role of beliefs in perception and experience. There will be a substantial individual research component winter quarter culminating in a presentation to the class.</p><p>The work will be challenging intellectually and personally. Students will be expected to keep a detailed log of their work and expect to document working efficiently for a minimum of 48 hours each week, including class time. Students should be willing to study details of empirical research of conscious and unconscious processes as well as be willing to explore their personal beliefs in a variety of areas and in both personal and group activities.</p></description>

    <title>Political Economy and Social Movements</title>
    <minimum_credits>16</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>16</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>This program is the primary gateway to the study of political economy at Evergreen. It introduces students to the fundamental building blocks of political-economic analysis: the history and institutions of capitalism, mainstream economics and radical alternatives, theories of democracy and social change, and the strategies and practice of social movements that seek to transform the existing framework. We examine political economy at all scales, from the very local to the international, and we analyze inequality in its different forms—the hierarchies of class, gender, nationality, race, and other statuses and identities. Special attention will be given to the role of culture in maintaining or challenging mainstream political and economic ideology. Students will expand their capacity to engage in public debate and social justice organizing through building skills in democratic decision-making, writing, public speaking, media communication, research, and quantitative methods. Credit equivalencies will be offered for introductory economics (micro and macro), politics, communication, and history.</p></description>

      This course will help students to develop clearer and more comprehensive understandings of literary texts, as well as to forge a more rewarding relationship with reading in general. In a supportive group environment, students will explore a range of reading strategies, including textual analysis, background research, response and summary writing, and recitation. Then they will apply these tools to an in-depth study of several works of nineteenth- and twentieth-century literature
      <em>.</em>
      Titles under consideration for Fall 2016 include Jane Austen&apos;s
      <i>Pride and Prejudice</i>
      and Ray Bradbury&apos;s
      <i>Fahrenheit 451</i>
      . Our overall goal is to become more resourceful, effective, and insightful readers.

    <title>Community Resilience: Science and Society</title>
    <minimum_credits>12</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>12</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>What can people do to foster the health of ecological systems and of human communities? Interplays of stress and resilience shape living systems, human and environmental. We can think of resilience as a system’s capacity to absorb or adapt to disturbance while holding to its original function and purpose. Stress broadly defined is anything that makes a system’s development more difficult, as the system acquires and transforms energy and material. </p><p>We will investigate the dynamic connections in living systems between stress (also referred to as change, or disturbance) and resilience (response or adaptation). Key questions include: What is resilience in ecological and human communities? How do ecological systems, and the human mind and aptitudes for action, draw resilience from stressful experience? And how can we build social capital (human relationships) and promote collective action, while supporting ecological and social capacities to respond positively to change? </p><p>Our second class meeting will be a one-day Saturday field trip to an old-growth forest and to Mt. St. Helens. There we will begin to examine relevant scientific and social concepts. During the rest of the quarter, Olympia’s Capitol Lake and the community of Olympia will focus our investigations of social and ecological capacities that support resilience before, during, and after stressful disturbance.</p><p>Program learning activities will include field work, labs and interactive workshops, discussions, readings, and research and writing assignments. Program participants will explore scientific perspectives, and work together to develop analytic habits of mind and performance as thoughtful observers and writers. Credit will be awarded in biology, ecology, and resilience and community studies.</p><p><em>Community Resilience:  Science and Society</em>  can be taken as a one-quarter program. It is also linked to  <em>Community Resilience</em>  programs in Winter and Spring. </p></description>

    <title>The Evolution of Constitutional Law Beyond the Twentieth Century</title>
    <minimum_credits>16</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>16</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>What does it mean when we say the Constitution of the United States is a living document?  What are the major shifts in U.S. Supreme Court doctrine? How have the First Amendment speech and religion clauses expanded and encompassed corporations and money as speech? How have women’s reproductive rights been eroded to the extent that some employers can refuse to provide health insurance to include birth control to employees based on the employer’s personal religious beliefs? What are the legal issues raised by current immigration cases?</p><p>In this program, we will ask these and related questions as we explore the landscape of judicial review in the 21st century. We will look for answers to our questions by exploring a number of substantive issues currently raised in the courts by the people and their representatives. These issues include higher education student debt, economic disparities and taxation, availability and access to health care insurance, reproductive rights, voting rights, immigration, age discrimination, the criminal justice system, ideals of equal justice under the law, and others.</p><p>Lectures, readings, and discussions will examine Constitutional theories and legal construction of selected cases, with particular focus on the currently sitting Roberts Court. Students and faculty will review legal precedents related to Constitutional doctrines raised by the Supreme Court’s interpretations of the law, established in its decisions, and analyzed and discussed by the legal community in law review articles and related academic periodicals. The program will employ the Socratic method to explore and examine students’ abilities to “think like a lawyer,” thereby deepening critical thinking and reasoning. Additionally, it is expected that students will acquire an enhanced knowledge of when and how precedents have evolved.</p><p>Students will conduct legal research on specific issues that will include legal history on Constitutional evolution and federal statutes. Through this process, students will expand understanding of precedents and recent U.S. Supreme Court decisions impacting rights and responsibilities of citizens.</p><p>Concomitant with program content and research, students will prepare and demonstrate knowledge of Constitutional law and legislative history by participating in moot court activities. Students will be placed in teams to research and present written and oral arguments on a selected topic for the Evergreen moot court competition. As part of this process, students will write legal memoranda and briefs on the case presented before the moot court. In preparing for moot court, students will be instructed, coached, and judged by Evergreen faculty as well as lawyers and judges outside of the Evergreen community.</p></description>

    <title>Political Economy of Washington State (1970 to Present)</title>
    <minimum_credits>4</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>4</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>Governance in Washington State has been shaped by the transformation from a rural natural resource based economy to a manufacturing based economy after WWII followed by a transition to a service/technology based economy in more recent years. Understanding the economic and social forces that dominate our politics and culture is key to charting a future course through times of growing national and international uncertainty. Our State Capitol City is the perfect learning laboratory for exploring the interplay between politics and economics. Students will learn how to access and use information from state data systems and archives.</p></description>

    <title>Fantastic Resistances: Astounding Tales for Envisioning Futures</title>
    <minimum_credits>16</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>16</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>Speculative and fantastic fiction responds to tensions in reality.  Envisioning impossible pasts, alternative presents, and potential futures empowers us to contribute to better futures. This program will mine the rich reserves of oppositional and radical thought in “what-if” modes of storytelling and media, from the 19th Century to the present. Fusing these with nonfiction and science studies, we will envision realistic and fantastic possibilities for just and sustainable futures.</p><p>We will study speculative genres’ critiques of, and proposed alternatives to, existing power asymmetries – colonial, technological, sexual, economic, raced and gendered – and their unjust and unsustainable outcomes.  How do imagined futures, alternative presents, and invented “never-weres” challenge social, political and material predicaments?  Are the continued economic growth and social asymmetries required by capitalism sustainable?  Are other socio-economic models feasible?</p><p>Walidah Imarisha says “all social organizing is science fiction…dreaming new realities together.” Is there a difference between science and science fiction, and between the fantastical and our reality, when thinking about our future? How can we tell?  How do these different disciplines complement each other? Can science, technology, policy, or even thaumaturgy offer new routes out of traditional ruts? Can renewable energy and sustainable agriculture replace fossil fuel dependence? Should we escape to another planet, try to heal the Earth, seek out a wormhole, or just take refuge in hidden or parallel realms? What questions should be asked about future technologies, polities, and personhoods? What are the potential costs, who benefits and who pays? </p><p>We will study imperial and popular histories; political philosophies; and the science of energy, systems, and climate change, in order to develop tools for analyzing questions like these.  We will also develop pre-calculus skills with interactive workshops, applied to questions we care about.</p><p>Supporting each other in teams, students will produce creative works of writing, art, research, or other media. These projects will attain final and fully polished form, ready for public presentation, by the end of winter quarter.</p><p>We will deeply explore the speculative, the scientific, and the fantastical together, while developing our communication skills and critical reasoning. We will do physics and math (there is no physics prerequisite – we will learn together). We will explore both cinema and literature, so students must be prepared for a viewing- and reading-intensive two quarters, including the nightmarish urbanities of Octavia Butler, China Miéville and Austin Troy; the monsters of Mary Shelley and Nnedi Okorafor; the hopes and nightmares of Ursula K. Le Guin and Elizabeth Kolbert; all threaded with Mike Hulme’s analysis of climate change, from science to social responses.</p></description>

    <description><p>We will learn beginning to intermediate astronomy through lectures, discussions, interactive workshops, and observations.  Using naked eye observations, reason, and simple mathematics, the ancients measured the sizes, distances, and motions of the Earth, Moon and Sun. So will we.  Making tools in class that students can take home, we will model heavenly motions, explore the nature of light and spectra, build telescopes, and more.  We will learn about the evolution and structure of our universe and celestial bodies.  We will explore our galaxy and neighboring galaxies using binoculars, telescopes, and planetarium programs. Students will explore a research topic and questions via observations and reading, and will share their learning with others.</p><p>We will read about and discuss cosmologies: how people across cultures and throughout history have understood, modeled, and ordered the universe they perceived. We will study stories, literature, and worldviews--from those of ancient peoples to modern writers and astrophysicists. Students will keep observation journals, tell star stories, make star maps, and explore the art and craft of essay writing. They will do substantial teamwork outside class, and will write essays and responses to readings. Students must be willing and able to use the internet for information and online assignments, to work in teams, and to meet after class on clear nights to participate in star-hunts. </p><p>Astronomy is a science.  Algebra II and trigonometry are prerequisite for astronomy.  We will learn physics together, from gravity and electromagnetism to dark matter and energy.  There is no physics prerequisite. </p></description>

    <maximum_credits>4</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>This course is designed to help students examine abnormal and normal behavior and experience along several dimensions. These dimensions include the historical and cultural influences in Western psychology, current views on abnormality and psychological health, cultural differences in the approach and treatment of psychopathology, and the role of healthy habitat in healthy mind. Traditional classification of psychopathology will be studied, including theories around etiology and treatment strategies. Non-traditional approaches will be examined including the role of eco-psychology in abnormal psychology. This course is a core course, required for pursuit of graduate studies in psychology</p></description>

    <title>Monsters: A Literary Exploration</title>
    <minimum_credits>8</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>8</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>Monsters occupy a conspicuous place in our consciousness, in our discourse, and in our literary creations. Why are we so fascinated by them? Why have they cropped up in cultures around the world for thousands of years and why, in a modern and technological age, do they continue to thrive? And what can we learn about ourselves and our world by critically examining our relationship with them, however imaginary they may be? In Western literature, monsters inhabit texts from the ancient epics to medieval works like <em>Beowulf</em> and Dante&apos;s <em>Divine Comedy</em> to Milton&apos;s <em>Paradise Lost</em> (1667) and Mary Shelley&apos;s <em>Frankenstein</em> (1818). The 1880s and 1890s alone give us a rich vein of inquiry with Robert Louis Stevenson&apos;s <em>Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr.</em><em>Hyde</em>, Oscar Wilde&apos;s <em><em>The Picture of Dorian Gray,</em></em> H.G. Wells&apos;s <em>The Island of Dr. Moreau</em>, and Bram Stoker&apos;s <em><em>Dracula</em></em>--all tales that meld the human and the bestial into new and disturbing forms. Our studies will encompass a number of these classic texts as well as more contemporary examples, such as David Beauchard&apos;s groundbreaking graphic novel, <i>Epileptic</i>.</p><p>Class activities will include seminars, films, small-group discussions, and workshops. Students will develop and articulate their new understandings by means of response papers, reflective journals, bibliographic summaries, and related writings. Because our topic invites investigation and interpretation from so many different perspectives--for example, those of philosophy, psychology, history, art, and the biological sciences--the program will also host guest speakers who can connect our inquiry to that of other disciplines. We may also attempt to consider some &quot;real-life&quot; monsters along the way: predator species, unstoppable disease agents, and humans themselves, with their immense and proven capacity for destruction. Where are the limits of the monstrous? Let&apos;s find out together.</p><p> </p><p> </p></description>

    <minimum_credits>16</minimum_credits>

    <description><p>
      This program will take students on an exploration of the persistent human quest to locate, identify, describe, ascribe power to, and/or worship deities or phenomena outside ourselves. We take as a point of departure that this instinct has been with us as a species since the beginning of recorded human history. As such, by investigating extant sources that document this instinct, we can ask
      <i>why</i>
      and
      <i>how</i>
      this instinct developed and continues to sustain itself. We begin with ancient Chinese, African, Mesopotamian, Indus (Hindu and Buddhist) Greek, and Egyptian religions (all the while problematizing the meaning of the word &quot;religion&quot;) and move on to development of monotheism begun by Hebrew tribes, to development of Western philosophies rooted in these traditions, to the present where the insistence on no (sure) God(s) (atheism and agnosticism) has gathered steam and developed its own ideologies, including scientism.
    </p><p>
      Students will develop analytic skills in critical historical method, history, philosophy, critical theory, and the study of religion. Readings will include primary sources from each tradition we look at, in addition to secondary sources that come to terms with them. Readings include, for example, selections from
      <em>The Egyptian Book of the Dead</em>
      , Homer,
      <em>The Upanishads</em>
      , the
      <em>Hebrew Bible</em>
      , Kant, Islamic exegesis, and readings in the &quot;New Atheist&quot; movement.

    <title>Playing Politics:  Psychology, Performance, Strategy, and the Elections in Real Time</title>
    <minimum_credits>8</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>8</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>From Donald Trump defeating <i>fifteen</i> Republican presidential hopefuls to the dismay of party insiders, to the unlikely rise of “democratic socialist” Bernie Sanders to challenge the Democratic party’s establishment candidate, Hillary Clinton—perhaps even at a contested national convention—the 2016 electoral cycle has been unlike any in modern political memory.  Meanwhile, nationwide, state-level politics have become ever more important in the face of a dysfunctional Congress, and a pivotal vacant seat on the Supreme Court hangs in the balance.  How this will turn out is anyone’s guess, but one thing is certain:  it will not be boring!  Join geographer John Baldridge and stage director Mark Harrison as we hone our skills as critically minded citizens in a two-quarter program that considers American politics from the perspectives of psychology, geography, performance art, and social relations.</p><p>With the US presidential election as a backdrop, we will engage with American politics at all levels, local, state and national. We will delve into the use and construction of political power—how it leverages cultural trends and reflects the geography of the electorate. We will examine how tactics of performance are employed to create images that have purchase on the political stage.  Satire, rhetoric, “spin,” appeals to values, the invocation of class struggle, portrayals of the Constitution, bi-partisanship, race relations, gender rights—all of these will be part of our curriculum. We will critique the campaigns as they unfold in real time—political ads, talking points, debates and damage control. And we will analyze plays, narrative and documentary films, and other forms of art and entertainment to determine how they have historically reflected or shaped political action and thought. Expect a field trip to a stage performance in each quarter and readings in political analysis, political geography, polling, and diverse sources of day-to-day political journalism. The Fall Quarter will follow the campaigns as they develop and culminate in national, state, and local elections. Prepare for an exciting and potentially bumpy ride!</p><p>Winter Quarter will see the Inaugural Address of a new president and the start of a new US Congress. What do “lame duck” politicians hope to accomplish? How do newly elected and continuing politicians frame their plans for the future? What can we, as an informed electorate, anticipate from the next political cycle? Students who enroll in this program should expect to do independent research on the elections, study political rhetoric and events, analyze polls and election results, and gain a strong sense of the present state of affairs at local, state, and national levels, in the context of American political history. We will end this program as better informed citizens, more ready to exercise our rights from a position of knowledge.  </p></description>

    <minimum_credits>16</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>16</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>This interdisciplinary, introductory-level program will explore topics in physical geology and applied precalculus mathematics. It is designed for students with a desire to have a broader and deeper understanding of the Earth, of mathematical concepts and functions, and of applications of math to earth sciences. The study of lab and field sciences and mathematical problem-solving through rigorous, quantitative, and interdisciplinary investigations will be emphasized. We expect students to finish the program with a strong understanding of the scientific and mathematical concepts that help us investigate the world around us.</p><p>In fall quarter geology we will study fundamental concepts in Earth science including geologic time, plate tectonics, and earth materials. Winter quarter geology will focus on Earth processes including soil development, nutrient cycling, and climate change. In both quarters our precalculus material will focus on families of mathematical functions, including polynomial, trigonometric, exponential, and logarithmic functions. Pattern identification and conceptual understanding of mathematical ideas will be emphasized along with applications to geological sciences. Additional math topics will include symmetry and geometry (with applications to mineral structure), and introductory concepts in probability and statistics. Quantitative reasoning and statistical analysis of data will be emphasized throughout the program and students will participate in weekly geology-content-based workshops focusing on improving mathematical skills. Fall quarter we will focus on skill-building in the laboratory and math workshops with the goal of doing meaningful field-lab work later in the year. Students will conduct group projects, including library research and writing, with opportunities for fieldwork.</p></description>

    <title>The Art of Acting: Empathy, Integrity, Eloquence</title>
    <minimum_credits>8</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>8</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>
      What does it take to interpret the great works of dramatic literature with your whole body and mind? The art of acting is inherently interdisciplinary.  It helps you develop empathy, integrity, eloquence, imagination, flexibility, discipline, logic, research, critical analysis, and a well-trained voice and body. This program will include intense training in voice, body, and emotional technique.  We will study the history and theory of acting styles and apply our learning to preparing short performance pieces. Our methods will include self-reflection through journaling; analysis of dramatic structure and of individual characters; rigorous vocal exercises; and scene work from great plays. Students will also be required to pursue, outside of class time, a disciplined physical practice of their choice, such as yoga, Tai Chi Chuan, or a martial art.  Texts will include Benedetti&apos;s translation of Stanislavski&apos;s classic work,
      <em>An Actor&apos;s Work</em>
      and Linklater&apos;s
      <em>Freeing the Natural Voice</em>
      . Credit will be awarded in Acting and Voice.

    <title>Political Shakespeares</title>
    <minimum_credits>16</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>16</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>Shakespeare’s scripts are in many ways notoriously conservative. Women dress up as men, only to be railroaded into marriage at the end of the play; Jews and people of color are regularly treated horribly by otherwise likeable characters; servants are routinely sidelined into supporting roles. Early in the 20th century, E.M.W. Tillyard went so far as to argue that the plays were written expressly for the purpose of maintaining the Elizabethan social order. Since the 1960s, however, scholars and theater professionals have been working to draw out the subversive content of the plays, arguing that Shakespeare’s representation of oppressive social norms can be read as a critique of those norms, as well as a prefiguration of our own contemporary political struggles. In the spirit of these subversive readings and productions, we will ask what, if anything, can Shakespeare’s plays DO for us in America of 2016? What kind of work can we make them perform?</p><p>This program is designed for students who want to engage in the project of reading literature against the grain. Liking Shakespeare is not a prerequisite. Rather, our focus will be on reimagining the potential of these plays by reading them alongside critical theory texts focused on race, class, gender, and disability, among other targeted identities. Students will read one play per week, along with sample pieces of critical theory, and write essays applying particular theoretical lenses to the plays.</p><p>This is not an acting program per se, but students will be expected to participate fully in weekly exercises that will help us better understand the plays as scripts designed for performance. Equally important, students will be expected to engage in thoughtful and occasionally challenging conversations about forms of power and privilege operating in the texts and on our own bodies. The program will be divided equally between creative and analytical modes of thought. Both are integral to the final project, in which students will research, rehearse, and perform sample scenes that express their interpretations of the plays.</p></description>

    <description><p>In winter quarter, students will continue to learn the mechanics of Russian grammar and new vocabulary to enable them to develop thematic presentations prompted by the topics covered in class. The class setting will provide students with ample opportunities for dialog and productive interaction in the target language. We will also start exploring selected works by such literary masters as A. Pushkin, L. Tolstoy, and A. Chekhov, to name a few, in order to understand not only the specifics of Russian grammar and vocabulary but also the complexities of Russian character and the Russian way of thinking as documented and preserved by outstanding Russian authors.</p></description>

    <maximum_credits>4</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>Multitrack Composition is the study of audio technology and its role in changing the art of music composition and production. This three quarter long sequence is concerned with the use of modern recording technologies as instrument. The use of signal processing, tape/computer based manipulation, and the structure of multitrack recorders and audio consoles allow a great number of techniques to be created on the fly to generate, modify, and document musical sound</p><p><br/> The course is for musicians and engineers who want to develop compositional, technical and collaborative skills in modern production. This is a lab course with limited (20) positions available. Please make sure you complete an application and speak with the faculty regarding your skills.  If you have any questions, please contact the faculty.</p></description>

    <title>East and West: Sanskrit and Greek Dance and Theatre</title>
    <minimum_credits>16</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>16</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>In this program, students will learn about two traditions of theatre and movement that come out of a common origin. They will study both spoken Greek theatre and gestural movement coming out of Sanskrit from South Asia. The gestural movement in Sanskrit theatre came out of various peoples not understanding Sanskrit, resulting in the creation of dance theatre that is communicable to one and all. Thus, they will learn a language similar to sign language. All students will be participating in both theatre and dance/gestural language workshops, resulting in a performance that incorporates material from both traditions. They will rehearse in order to produce theatre/movement/gestural language from both traditions. Performance art is also communication art. We will explore two traditions of performance art that will include technical theatre. There will be interactive lectures, two workshops, and rehearsals every week. Attendance is imperative.</p></description>

    <title>Movements: African-American Culture in the (Long) 20th Century</title>
    <minimum_credits>16</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>16</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>Movements emerge out of adverse political conditions and embody new creative strategies and possibilities. This program will explore how African-American writers, media makers, musicians, artists, and community activists use a range of methods to resist white supremacy and foster resilience within their communities. We will examine interrelated political, literary, artistic, and musical movements that have emerged from African-American experience through the “long 20th century,” beginning at Reconstruction and continuing into the present day. Our program trajectory will be historical, and will consider the arts as a primary connective tissue among the movements up for consideration. Our work together will bring us to the Harlem Renaissance, the civil rights movement, the Black Arts movement, Afrofuturism, Neo Soul, and Black Lives Matter. We will consider how the unique conditions and histories of African-Americans have shaped these movements, and how they have interacted with other artistic and social-justice movements.</p><p>In fall quarter students will learn to read African-American cultural texts—including film, music, visual art and literature—to understand the relationships of people and communities, their sense of identity and possibilities for solidarity across differences. Through workshops students will develop skills in visual and media literacy, library and community-based research, digital photography and video editing, creative and expository writing, analytical reading and viewing, and literary analysis.</p><p>In winter quarter students will bring their historical studies into the present day by conducting collaborative research projects examining contemporary African-American movements. Students will be encouraged to use the range of skills they have developed in the program to plan, execute, and share these projects with the broader Evergreen community.</p></description>

    <title>Mediaworks:  Re/presenting Power and Difference</title>
    <minimum_credits>16</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>16</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>What does it mean to make moving images in an age of omnipresent media, information overload, social inequality, and global capitalism? What&apos;s the relationship between aesthetic form and power across race, class, gender, sexuality, and other axes of difference? How can we understand the interplay between popular media and experimental modes? How do we critically engage with the history and traditions of media practices while testing the boundaries of established forms? What responsibilities do media artists and producers have to their subjects and audiences? How can media makers represent or transform the “real” world? Can media artists contribute to social change? As media artists, how do we enter debates around social and political justice? How do we critically engage new media as a form of activism and cultural critique? Students will engage with these questions as they gain skills in film/video/television history and theory, critical analysis, media production, collaboration, and critique.</p><p>This is the foundational program for media arts/media studies at Evergreen, linking theory with practice. The program emphasizes media technology and hands-on production practices along with the study of media history and theory—inquiry that is central to developing strategies of representation in our own work as media artists. As creative critics, we will gain fluency in methodologies including close reading and formal analysis, mapping narrative and genre, unpacking power from feminist, critical race, de-colonial, and anti-capitalist perspectives, and cultural, historical, and technological framing of commercial and independent media production. These analytical skills will help us understand strategies that artists have employed to challenge, mobilize, and re-appropriate mainstream media forms. As critical creators, we&apos;ll learn foundational production skills and experiment with alternative approaches including documentary, nonfiction, video art, autobiography, essay films, remix, and research/writing for and about media. In addition to production assignments, program activities will encompass analysis and criticism through screenings, readings, seminars, research, and critical writing. We&apos;ll also spend significant time in critique sessions discussing our creative and critical work.</p><p>In fall students will explore ways of seeing, listening, and observing in various formats, focusing intensively on 16 mm film production and completing both skill-building exercises and short projects. These collaborative exercises and projects will have thematic and technical guidelines consistent with program curriculum. Our production work will be grounded in the study of concepts and methodologies from media history and theory, including significant critical reading, research, and writing. In hands-on workshops and assignments we&apos;ll analyze images as communication and commodities and investigate how images create and contest meaning in art, politics, and consumer culture. Collaboration—a skill learned through practice—will be an important aspect of our work in this learning community.</p><p>In winter students will delve deeply into field- and studio-based video/audio production and digital editing, using the CCAM studio and HD video technologies. We&apos;ll do this learning in conjunction with studying the social and technological history of television and video. Our production work will be primarily collaborative, although students will conclude the quarter by working on an independent project proposal.</p><p>In spring, as a culmination of the conceptual, collaboration, and production skills developed in fall and winter, students will create independent projects, individually or collaboratively. Technical workshops, screenings, research presentations, and critique discussions will support this emerging work.</p></description>

    <title>Catastrophe: Community Resilience in the Face of Disaster</title>
    <minimum_credits>16</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>16</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>This program will explore the role of natural and human-made disasters—including earthquakes, tsunamis, hurricanes, floods, droughts, volcanic activity, landslides, wildfires, pandemics, wars, attacks, uprisings, and radioactive and toxic leaks—in shaping human society and consciousness. A central focus will be on how many of these place-based upheavals are becoming more common or intense in the climate crisis, and how communities can plan, respond, and adapt under new conditions. The program will apply the lessons from elsewhere in the world to locally in the Pacific Northwest.</p><p>
      On one hand, many so-called “natural” disasters have their roots in exploitation of the Earth and human beings, and social inequalities put the greatest burden of recovery on the poor (such as in earthquakes in Haiti and Nepal). “Disaster capitalism” is often used to centralize political and economic control in the aftermath of mass catastrophes, as Naomi Klein describes in
      <em>The Shock Doctrine</em>
      . These inequalities will be worsened as climate change generates more intense storms, sea-level rise, droughts, and flooding.
    </p><p>
      On the other hand, responses to disasters (such as hurricanes Katrina and Sandy) have become opportunities to build better relationships to each other and our ecosystems, as Rebecca Solnit describes in
      <em>A Paradise Built in Hell</em>
      . Planning for “disaster cooperativism” strengthens the ability of local communities and cultures to sustain shocks (such as climate change), unite communities across racial and cultural barriers, and promote greater social and ecological equality.
    </p><p>Our inquiry will draw insights from communities that have survived disasters and are recovering from historical trauma, including Indigenous and other colonized peoples, war refugees, and military veterans. It will learn from Indigenous epics that describe disasters through oral tradition, and methods of resilience that Native societies have used to persevere over the centuries. These insights will be explored through texts, lectures, workshops, field trips, films, art, and literature.</p><p>
      The program will explore how communities and nations can democratically prepare and practice for disasters, as Elaine Scarry describes in
      <em>Thinking in an Emergency</em>
      . Planners and activists can use emergency planning and response to increase awareness of ecological ways to prevent future disasters, the need to share resources among neighbors, and deepen lasting cooperation. In particular, climate change adaptation can be effectively used a reason to quickly make necessary changes for a healthier future that otherwise may take many more years to implement.
    </p><p>Our inquiry will be conducted at the intersections of climate justice studies, Native studies, and geography. It will use varied research methodologies as tools of inquiry, including ethnographic interviews that establish narratives (storytelling), community mapping, film analysis, government document research, and case studies of disasters. Students will have the opportunity to participate in community emergency response training.</p></description>

    <title>Spanish, Beginning II (A)</title>
    <minimum_credits>4</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>4</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>This year-long sequence of courses covers the first year of Spanish. </p><p>Have you wanted to learn Spanish so you can communicate face-to-face when you take that long-dreamed of trip to the sunny beaches of Mexico, Central or South America?   Have you noticed that you hear more Spanish being spoken in the various community locations you frequent such as grocery, hardware and department stores?   Are you curious about the culture of the people that now constitute the largest ethnic minority in the United States?  Have you come to the conclusion that being able to communicate in Spanish would greatly increase your professional or academic flexibility and value?  Did you study Spanish previously and want to “brush up” on your skills? Any and all of these are excellent reasons to study Spanish, and one of the Spanish classes offered at Evergreen will meet your needs.</p><p>Beginning Spanish II may be the best class for you if you have fairly recent or familial experience with the language and a good grasp of the fundamentals of grammar such as conjugation of verbs and the appropriate use of <em>ser/estar</em> . Sometimes, students with recent, more advanced study, whether through real world or academic experience, are ready for Beginning Spanish III.   One of the Spanish language faculty can assist you in finding the right class for your needs.  </p><p>Classes are highly interactive, safe environments to practice your new skills.   A wide range of learning activities is provided so that students learn to read, write, speak and understand the language.   Students use a written text and workbook for self-study.   An online learning vehicle is also used so that students are immersed in the various components of the language.   Students have access to a language lab that incorporates Rosetta Stone for additional practice.   Cultural activities are integrated into the classes so that students learn not only the language but also the major cultural values and traditions of countries where Spanish is spoken.   A culminating language fair is held during spring quarter in conjunction with other language classes and provides language students with opportunities to display their own learning as well as learn about the other cultures represented by those languages.   Come join us and begin expanding your world – present and future!</p><p>The following is a short description of the material covered in each of the Beginning Spanish classes:</p><p>Beginning Spanish I: Beginning Spanish I students acquire the skills to understand written and oral language and to express themselves in written and oral language about the following: greetings, introductions, expressions of courtesy, academic life, days of the week, schedules, family, identifying and describing people, professions and occupations, leisure activities, sports, asking for and giving directions within a city or campus, travel and vacation arrangements and activities, months and seasons of the year and weather.    Students acquire the following grammatical structures: use of the verbs <em>hay</em> and <em>gustar</em> , conjugation of verbs in the present tense including stem-changing verbs, <em>ser</em> and <em>estar</em> , noun/adjective agreement, subject/verb agreement, and various idiomatic expressions related to the topics studied.</p><p>Beginning Spanish II: Beginning Spanish II students acquire the skills to understand written and oral language and to express themselves in written and oral language about the following: vacations and other free time activities, months of the year, seasons and weather, clothing and shopping, negotiating a price and buying, colors, daily routines and time expressions, food and meals.   Students acquire the following grammatical structures: use of the reflexive mood and preterit tense, including verbs <em>ser</em> and <em>ir</em> in the preterit, demonstrative pronouns, direct and indirect object pronouns, and various idiomatic expressions related to the topics studied.</p><p>Beginning Spanish III: Beginning Spanish III students continue to build their knowledge base of the foundational communicative structures, including: use of reflexive verbs, indefinite and negative words, preterite of irregular and stem-changing verbs, double object pronouns, the imperfect tense, contrasting uses and meanings of preterite and imperfect tenses, familiar and formal commands, and the present subjunctive.   These structures are acquired while communicating about the following: describing one’s daily personal hygiene and life routines, shopping for and describing food and preparing meals, parties and celebrations, family relationships and stages of life, identifying parts of the body and symptoms and medical conditions to obtain medical assistance and daily domestic chores and routines.</p></description>

    <description><p>
      Nowadays, the word
      <i>border</i>
      conjures images of the U.S.-Mexico border, patrol agents, walls and barbed wire. Yet there are many kinds of borders: between racial, ethnic, and cultural groups; between social classes; between genders and sexualities; and even between belief systems, languages, and different ways of knowing. They are real and they are metaphorical.  Depending on who you are, you may barely notice some borders, while others may seem impossible to cross. What forces construct—and deconstruct—these various types of borders?  
    </p><p>Economic systems involve many borders. Businesses and policy makers determine how fruits of economic labor are distributed between profits and wages, white collar and blue collar, and between Wall Street and Main Street. Behaviors of real estate agents and bank policies create barriers for people of color buying homes in predominantly white neighborhoods. Immigration status delineates who has the right to work and fully participate in society. What determines which residents, workers, and groups are protected? Who is, and is not, allowed to move freely and why? </p><p>Borders also play out in our identities, in sometimes conflicting ways. Society defines simplistic, often binary boxes—black-white, female-male, gay-straight, young-old, among others—that do not capture a range of experiences along a continuum. The intersections between different aspects of our selves create tensions between generations, within cultural groups, among political activists, within classrooms, or among friends.  </p><p>We will combine literature, history, economics, and political economy to examine the role borders play in identities, economic welfare, and community self-determination. While we will be cognizant of all types of borders during both quarters, we will begin fall quarter with the impacts of the international borders dividing the United States from Latin America. In winter we will shift our primary focus to the peoples living within the United States. Students will gain an in-depth ability to critically analyze a range of texts in social context and to use political economic models. We will work systematically on critical reading, writing, and collaboration skills. Quantitative study will focus on international economics and personal finance. We will also cross the campus border to surrounding communities though field trips and some community-based learning with local organizations. </p><p>By the end of the program we will be better able to understand both the forces that create and enforce borders, and the forces that may modify or erase them, sometimes reinforcing patterns of domination, but other times enabling liberatory social change. </p></description>

    <description><p>Language and mathematics represent two areas of human cognition characterized by significant complexity and abstraction. In this program we will study linguistics and mathematics, as well as the mental processes and structures associated with each of these areas of thought and knowledge. We will analyze language structure, including the study of phonology (speech sounds), syntax (sentence structure), and semantics (linguistic meaning). We will also study mathematics with the goal of illuminating the nature of mathematical thinking. Topics in math will include mathematical logic and proofs, number systems, and introductory concepts from set theory and abstract algebra.</p><p>Alongside our studies of linguistics and mathematics, we will engage in seminar reading and discussion relating to cognitive processes associated with language and mathematical thinking. We will explore such questions as: How does the human mind handle abstraction? What is the role of metaphor in language and math? Can particular aspects of language and math be identified as learned or innate? How do children learn language skills (such as speaking and reading) and mathematics (such as numerical and spacial reasoning)? How does mathematical thinking emerge across cultures?</p><p>The work for this program will include solving math problems, writing proofs, studying abstract principles of grammar, and reading and writing about cognition and mental structure.</p></description>

    <title>Psychology and Mindfulness</title>
    <minimum_credits>16</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>16</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>Mindfulness is the ability to fully attend to what is at hand and be in the present moment. Mindfulness is being applied to a variety of professional fields, including health care and education, to improve effectiveness and enhance well-being. The practice of mindfulness can increase our individual and collective resiliency to respond to changing personal and global situations in adaptive and creative ways.</p><p>The program will focus on mindfulness through theory, practice, and its application in relation to developmental psychology and abnormal psychology. Questions to be explored include how is mindfulness being integrated into working with people at various developmental stages of life? How can mindfulness be applied to emotional health? How is mindfulness being integrated in working with physical and mental health?</p><p>Fall quarter will focus on developing a foundational understanding of constructive thought and emotion from both Eastern and Western perspectives based on philosophy, psychology, and neuroscience. Students will study developmental psychology of birth through adolescence in terms of emotional, physical, and mental development. Winter quarter will focus on mindfulness, destructive thought and emotions through exploring habitual patterns of thought, emotion, and behaviors. Students will study human development from adult, geriatric, and end of life perspectives. Spring quarter will focus on how mindfulness is being applied in clinical settings to promote physical and mental health. Students will study abnormal psychology and see how mindfulness is being integrated into the treatment of mental health, pain, addictions, hypertension, and other health conditions.</p><p>Mindfulness will be explored through theoretical, applied, and expressive arts projects. Each quarter will include a full-day mindfulness retreat. In addition, students will also look at how these dimensions of mindfulness interface with developmental and abnormal psychology.</p><p>Students will have an opportunity to learn in many ways using diverse modalities and multiple intelligences. We will integrate mindfulness practices into our studies, including movement, integrative health practices, and expressive art workshops (no prior experience necessary). We will participate in community readings, rigorous writing assignments, theoretical tests, and critical study of important texts.</p></description>

    <title>Spanish, Beginning III</title>
    <minimum_credits>4</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>4</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>This year-long sequence of courses covers the first year of Spanish. </p><p>Have you wanted to learn Spanish so you can communicate face-to-face when you take that long-dreamed of trip to the sunny beaches of Mexico, Central or South America?   Have you noticed that you hear more Spanish being spoken in the various community locations you frequent such as grocery, hardware and department stores?   Are you curious about the culture of the people that now constitute the largest ethnic minority in the United States?  Have you come to the conclusion that being able to communicate in Spanish would greatly increase your professional or academic flexibility and value?  Did you study Spanish previously and want to “brush up” on your skills? Any and all of these are excellent reasons to study Spanish, and one of the Spanish classes offered at Evergreen will meet your needs.</p><p>Students with recent, more advanced study, whether through real world or academic experience, are ready for Beginning Spanish III.  </p><p>Classes are highly interactive, safe environments to practice your new skills.   A wide range of learning activities is provided so that students learn to read, write, speak and understand the language.   Students use a written text and workbook for self-study.   An online learning vehicle is also used so that students are immersed in the various components of the language.   Students have access to a language lab that incorporates Rosetta Stone for additional practice.   Cultural activities are integrated into the classes so that students learn not only the language but also the major cultural values and traditions of countries where Spanish is spoken.   A culminating language fair is held during spring quarter in conjunction with other language classes and provides language students with opportunities to display their own learning as well as learn about the other cultures represented by those languages.   Come join us and begin expanding your world – present and future!</p><p>The following is a short description of the material covered in each of the Beginning Spanish classes:</p><p>Beginning Spanish I: Beginning Spanish I students acquire the skills to understand written and oral language and to express themselves in written and oral language about the following: greetings, introductions, expressions of courtesy, academic life, days of the week, schedules, family, identifying and describing people, professions and occupations, leisure activities, sports, asking for and giving directions within a city or campus, travel and vacation arrangements and activities, months and seasons of the year and weather.    Students acquire the following grammatical structures: use of the verbs <em>hay</em> and <em>gustar</em> , conjugation of verbs in the present tense including stem-changing verbs, <em>ser</em> and <em>estar</em> , noun/adjective agreement, subject/verb agreement, and various idiomatic expressions related to the topics studied.</p><p>Beginning Spanish II: Beginning Spanish II students acquire the skills to understand written and oral language and to express themselves in written and oral language about the following: vacations and other free time activities, months of the year, seasons and weather, clothing and shopping, negotiating a price and buying, colors, daily routines and time expressions, food and meals.   Students acquire the following grammatical structures: use of the reflexive mood and preterit tense, including verbs <em>ser</em> and <em>ir</em> in the preterit, demonstrative pronouns, direct and indirect object pronouns, and various idiomatic expressions related to the topics studied.</p><p>Beginning Spanish III: Beginning Spanish III students continue to build their knowledge base of the foundational communicative structures, including: use of reflexive verbs, indefinite and negative words, preterite of irregular and stem-changing verbs, double object pronouns, the imperfect tense, contrasting uses and meanings of preterite and imperfect tenses, familiar and formal commands, and the present subjunctive.   These structures are acquired while communicating about the following: describing one’s daily personal hygiene and life routines, shopping for and describing food and preparing meals, parties and celebrations, family relationships and stages of life, identifying parts of the body and symptoms and medical conditions to obtain medical assistance and daily domestic chores and routines.</p></description>

    <description><p>If you are in your last year of undergraduate study at Evergreen, this course will help you to reflect on your education – its overall shape, and its significance both for yourself and for the world you will live in. You will engage in a series of reflective workshops and exercises to help you to reveal and articulate the shape of your education. Seminar readings will be largely drawn from texts that have been central to students&apos; own studies. Through this work we will explore connections among each others&apos; studies and consider what it means to have a liberal arts education. You will also write and revise with care your Academic Statement, which you may include in your transcript.<b> Note:For students admitted to Evergreen beginning in 2013-14, a transcript Academic Statement is a graduation requirement.</b></p></description>

    <maximum_credits>4</maximum_credits>
    <description><p><span>Calculus is the mathematical study of change. This course is designed for students interested in further studies in science, mathematics, engineering, technology and economics.</span></p><p><span> In the third quarter of this thematically-integrated course, students will cover a full year of calculus through small-group discussions, interactive lectures, and hands-on laboratory investigations. We will learn about limits, rate of change, differentiation and its rules, optimization, integration and its applications (area under the curve, volumes of revolution, arc length and surfaces), methods of integration, differential equations and multi-variable calculus. We will take a numerical, algebraic and graphical approach to the main concepts of calculus. This class will cover many of the traditional topics of a first-year calculus sequence. <br/></span></p></description>

    <title>French - First Year II</title>
    <minimum_credits>4</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>4</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>This year-long sequence of courses in French emphasizes mastery of basic skills through a solid study of grammatical structures and focus on interactive oral activities.  Classes use immersion style learning and students are surrounded by authentic French from the start.  Student work encompasses all four language skills: listening, speaking, reading and writing.  They will develop accurate pronunciation, build a useful vocabulary, work regularly in small groups and learn conversational skills.  Classes are lively and fast-paced with a wide variety of creative, fun activities including music, poetry, videos, role-play, and web sites.  Winter quarter themes focus on regional French traditions, cuisine, fables and poetry.  Through aloud reading and discussions in French, students will acquire vocabulary proficiency, accurate pronunciation, fluidity, and dialogues.  Throughout the year, students use the Language Laboratory to accelerate their skills.</p></description>

    <title>Community Resilience: Social Equity and Environmental Issues</title>

    <maximum_credits>8</maximum_credits>
    <description><p><i>Community Resilience: Social Equity and Environmental Issues </i>is a program about thriving in the midst of potentially catastrophic shifts. We will be thinking and talking from the perspectives of sociology and community studies along several lines of inquiry:</p><ul><li>the ways in which environment and nature are socially constructed in history, and how various social forces contribute to the identification, emergence, and community responses to environmental issues.</li><li>the effects of inequality – how social aspects of environmental realities in the U.S. are manifested along the lines of race, income and wealth.</li><li>the promise of equity, especially transformative community responses to climate crisis. Here we will focus on innovative ways of reorganizing communal life, already underway around the world.</li></ul><p>Several of our program “texts” will be serious games, learning activities through which we can explore issues and develop abilities necessary to effectively engage “wicked” problems (complex problems without an endpoint, which evolve and take new directions over time). Game-based learning fosters skills in collaboration, analytical thinking, decision making, and strategic innovation – capacities vital to community resilience. </p><p> </p><p>Please note that our work will address equity aspects of community organization, environmental issues, and social transformation. This program is not a science-based investigation into global warming, or an investigation of environmental science.</p><p> </p><p>Community Resilience: Social Equity and Environmental Issues<i> is the third of three programs in the Community Resilience series. Junior and senior students new to the series are welcome. (First- and second-year students who began the series in Fall or Winter are welcome to continue through Spring quarter.) </i></p></description>

    <description><p>As external pressures on schools increase—through such forces as standardized testing and public accountability—many people concerned about education would argue that we have lost sight both of the active learning of the individual student and of the social conditions in which our school systems exist.</p><p>This program will explore the question: In what ways can an understanding of language, learning, and creativity clarify our vision of the education of children, lead to more pedagogically sound classroom practice, and meet social justice goals of equity and opportunity? Focusing primarily on language and the literary arts, this program will examine the psychological, social, and philosophical foundations of language development; the teaching of writing within constructivist and social-constructivist pedagogy; literature and literary theory as they relate to all levels of elementary and secondary education; and the historical tensions between philosophy of education and educational practice in the past century. Students will also participate in weekly writing groups as one way to observe closely the interaction between language, writing, and learning.</p><p>In spring quarter, we will draw together these strands in studying the current political struggles between traditional and constructivist education, with particular attention to the teaching of writing and literature in the schools and to arts education in general. In addition, students will conduct classroom observations (in elementary or secondary classrooms) and/or significant reading-research projects on topics in language, literature, the arts, and public education.</p><p>The 12-credit option will enable students to meet specific requirements for Washington State teacher certification. Students may earn the additional four credits in any of the following areas: children’s literature, adolescent literature, multicultural literature, or language skills/structure. (Please note that only 2-3 choices will be available each quarter.) Students will earn these credits through participating in a weekly small-group seminar and completing significant independent work in coordination with the curriculum of the 8-credit core of the program.</p></description>

    <description><p><span>For beginning and returning students, this 4-credit class is designed to strengthen students&apos; reading, writing, and critical thinking skills in relation to Evergreen&apos;s Five Foci (Interdisciplinary Study, Collaborative Learning, Learning Across Significant Differences, Personal Engagement, and Linking Theory with Practical Applications). Students will read, write about, discuss in seminar, and do workshops focused on a common theme. This quarter, the theme will be the place of higher education in contemporary society. Students will also do research and writing on a topic of particular importance to them in their own college education. Through doing this work, students will sharpen the abilities needed to shape a strong Liberal Arts education at Evergreen. </span></p></description>

    <maximum_credits>4</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>This year-long sequence of courses in French emphasizes mastery of basic skills through a solid study of grammatical structures and focus on interactive oral activities.  Classes use immersion style learning and students are surrounded by authentic French from the start.  Student work encompasses all four language skills: listening, speaking, reading and writing.  They will develop accurate pronunciation, build a useful vocabulary, work regularly in small groups and learn conversational skills.  Classes are lively and fast-paced with a wide variety of creative, fun activities including music, poetry, videos, role-play, and web sites.  Spring quarter themes focus on development of reading skills through tales, legends and viewing Francophone films from the Francophone world alongside grammatical study.  Through aloud reading and discussions in French, students will acquire vocabulary proficiency, accurate pronunciation, fluidity, and dialogues.  Throughout the year, students use the Language Laboratory to accelerate their skills.</p></description>

    <description><p>This year-long course is designed for those who are in between Beginning and Intermediate Level, but beyond basic Beginner level.  It is targeted to bring student skills up with overview and review of first year structures moving quickly to more advanced grammar. Classes will be conducted entirely in French.  Students need to have a working knowledge of basic structures, particularly present and past tenses.  The primary objectives are communicative interactions in French, alongside enhanced development of grammatical proficiency.  Students will practice all four language skills: listening, speaking, reading and writing. They will learn not only to express themselves in French, but to understand written and spoken French and discover much they didn&apos;t know about themselves.  Spring quarter students will read a short novel and work with its companion film. Throughout the year, students use the Language Laboratory to accelerate their skills.</p></description>

    <description><p><span>Komm und lern Deutsch! In this third course of a year-long sequence of courses for beginning German students will cover basic grammatical concepts, vocabulary, and conversation.  Students will develop basic skills in speaking, reading, translating, and writing standard high German.  Students will also learn about culture, traditions, and customs of the German people, new and old.  Through involvement in children’s stories, music, and activities in the language laboratory, students will also become familiar with idiomatic expressions.  By the end of the year, students will improve their oral skills to the point of discussing short films and modern short stories and learning how to write a formal letter, a resumé, or a job application. Classes will use a communicative method and will move quickly toward being conducted primarily in German.Taught by a NATIVE SPEAKER.</span></p></description>

    <title>Health for All of Us: Staying Healthy While We Create an Equitable System</title>
    <minimum_credits>8</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>8</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>This three-quarter program will explore the definitions, determinants, and implications of health for individuals, communities, and larger populations.  How do individuals define health and wellbeing?  How do culture, economics, and institutional racism affect the equitable attainment of health?  Why are some groups of people systematically healthier than others?  What can we do about the systematic differences that result in health inequity in the United States?  How do people who wish to eliminate barriers to equity remain healthy themselves?</p><p> The program will examine the context of individual health and wellbeing, in terms of the World Health Organization definition of health: a state of mental, physical, and social well-being.  We will consider health psychology, the ways that behavior and culture influence individual perceptions of health, illness, and interactions with the healthcare system. Students will explore the social determinants of population health in The United States.  Health literacy and Health activation will be examined as ways to link individual self-efficacy and autonomy to effective interaction with the health care system. The class will consider the potential for popular culture, including hip-hop, other spoken word art, visual art, and music to provide tools for the development of health autonomy in oppressed communities.   The importance of individual self-awareness and health preservation for those who would catalyze change will also be explored.</p><p>This program is designed for students who would like to enhance their understanding of the social, cultural, and political factors that influence health and health care in the United States. By the end of the third quarter, students will understand more about the relationships between individual wellbeing, culture, the social determinants of health, and health care.  They will also have the tools to remain healthy themselves as they advocate for improvements to the current and inadequate healthcare system in the United States.  </p></description>

    <title>Scientific and Artistic Inquiry</title>
    <minimum_credits>16</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>16</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>
      We often think of art and science as polarized disciplines, yet the processes of scientific and artistic inquiry are remarkably alike. Both the scientist and the artist work with the material world, asking questions about what it does, how it works, why it matters, and 
      <em>what happens </em>
      if
      <em>….?</em>
       Both science and art require a significant knowledge base, imagination, and a sense of wonder. Each discipline relies on critical engagement by others in the field.  Scientists and artists 1) require the development of skills that enable close observation and fresh perspectives, 2) are inherent problem-solvers and creators of new knowledge, 3) engage in exhaustive revision, reiteration, and practice, and 4) need to develop strong skills in synthesis and interpretation of outcomes and  diverse kinds of information. This program will examine the similarities between scientific and artistic processes and inquiry through lectures, field studies, laboratory, and studio assignments. This program is an especially good fit for students who have previously felt they don’t belong in the arts or sciences.
    </p><p>
      Fall Quarter we’ll explore histories of science and art, using texts --
      <em>The People’s History of Science</em>
      and
      <em>The Invention of Art --</em>
       that question conventional accounts, including the dominant culture’s biased assumption that scientific thinking is largely a Euro-American enterprise. Part of our work in fall will involve learning how First Peoples gained scientific knowledge and developed technological innovations through trial-and-error in many cases, well
      <em>before</em>
      Europeans
      <em>. </em>
      Students will learn skills for contributing to, and learning from, seminars, lectures, and trial-and-error in labs, field work and the studio.  Through weekly labs and studio sessions, students will learn introductory skills and knowledge of fresh water ecology and introductory drawing instruction.  No prior experience in any of these disciplines is necessary!
    </p><p>Building on the knowledge and skills gained in fall quarter, students will learn how to read scientific articles, use their drawing skills to explore intaglio printmaking (etching and engraving). They’ll learn stream ecology through small group projects and experience the challenges and rewards of collaborative, interdisciplinary research through a major project incorporating scientific and artistic modes of demonstration in winter quarter.  Although central themes of the program will remain, student learning will be deepened by putting theory into practice in the studio, field, and lab. The focus will be on developing skills and practice in the scientific and creative process, from observations to communication.</p></description>

                   In order to support new students’ transitions into the program, those joining the program in winter will be expected to read (1) Introduction of
                   <i>The Invention of Art</i>
                   by Shiner and Chapter One of
                   <i>A People’s History of Science</i>
                   by Conner, (2) write a 750-word (maximum) informal essay demonstrating learning from the texts, due 9 a.m. by Monday of week 2, and (3) students should also read Chapter 24 of
                   <i>Freshwater Ecology: Concepts and Environmental Applications</i>
                   by Walter Dodds (e-book available through Evergreen Library). To demonstrate learning from this text, students will complete an open-book, take-home worksheet by 9 a.m. Monday of Week 2.  Failure to complete the assignments by the deadline will result in the loss of two credits. Please contact Carri LeRoy (
                   <a href="mailto:leroyc@evergreen.edu">leroyc@evergreen.edu</a>
                   ) and Lisa Sweet (

    <title>French - Second Year II</title>
    <minimum_credits>4</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>4</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>This year-long course is designed for those who are in between Beginning and Intermediate Level, but beyond basic Beginner level.  It is targeted to bring student skills up with overview and review of first year structures moving quickly to more advanced grammar. Classes will be conducted entirely in French.  Students need to have a working knowledge of basic structures, particularly present and past tenses.  The primary objectives are communicative interactions in French, alongside enhanced development of grammatical proficiency.  Students will practice all four language skills: listening, speaking, reading and writing. They will learn not only to express themselves in French, but to understand written and spoken French and discover much they didn&apos;t know about themselves.    Winter quarter themes will include theater scenes, role-play and work with films.  Throughout the year, students use the Language Laboratory to accelerate their skills.</p></description>

    <title>Advocating for a Sustainable Future</title>
    <minimum_credits>8</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>8</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>How can we advocate for positions and promote informed decision-making about issues in the public sphere?  In this program, we will begin by looking at advocacy and proposals targeting a just transition to clean energy.  Is this an extreme case or a reachable goal?  As a class, we will work down from global environmental and social justice concerns to local issues of interest.  Guest speakers will provide current information about local issues, and we will take day-long field trips to view areas at risk and see some positive outcomes of local advocacy and action.  Student groups will select an issue on which to focus and develop a panel presentation, pamphlet, article, social media campaign, or other product that serves as effective advocacy.  The objective of the advocacy could range from educating the public to engaging citizens in action to influencing decision makers.  In the process, methods of quantitative and qualitative analysis will be introduced and combined with scientific and public policy research to assess the complex landscape of proposals for a sustainable future. Students will work to improve their own fluency with numerical information and will focus on developing ways to highlight, clarify, and effectively communicate numerical data. Academic and journalistic writing, storytelling methods, and other modes of communication will be developed to create informative, influential products intended for specific audiences.</p></description>

    <description><p>Scientific inquiry into human behavior and cognition is a dynamic and rapidly growing field that influences personal development and diverse careers. This course examines essential aspects of the human experience (neurology, sensation and perception, personality, learning, memory, cognition, emotion) and political, economic, and cultural influences. Contemporary trends and specific sub-disciplines (neuropsychology, childhood development, gerontology, organizational behavior, wellness, etc.) will be addressed. Those seeking underpinnings for work in mental health and social work, education, medicine, public policy, and law, will find this course indispensable. Students will demonstrate skill at applying theory to practice in “psychological notebooks”, integrative response papers and group activities.</p></description>

    <title>Writer's Workshop: Writing for Change</title>
    <minimum_credits>8</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>8</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>
      How do we use writing effectively to propel social movements and change?  Many genres of writing, from academic papers to poetry, provide the information to engage the public in critical issues such as inequality and human rights.  We will gain foundations in several areas over two quarters in order to deepen our knowledge and educate others on student selected topics.  In winter, we will focus extensively on how to use research as a tool of persuasion, and to present our findings effectively.  Students will draft and revise a journalistic or magazine style piece, as well as complete an essay, that address current topics and crises that have both a local and global angle.  We will pay particular attention to theories of persuasion and the work of Marshall Ganz in influencing social movements.  In spring, we will expand to the use of creative writing that may influence critical societal issues.  For example, how might students use poetry, fiction, or science fiction to draw readers into “story” that ultimately engages them in critical issues?  Is there fiction for our generations that have the impact of
      <i>The Grapes of Wrath</i>
      ? How do we construct characters, narratives, and scenes that galvanize our readers and audiences?  Throughout both quarters, we will engage in many writing exercises and workshops, ranging from interviewing to spoken word poetry.

    <title>Inscribing the Body: Embodiment and the Performance of Identity in Creative Writing</title>
    <minimum_credits>4</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>4</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>In what ways is writing necessarily gendered? Or raced? Or seen through the lens of class?  This class will take up &quot;the body&quot; as a site of radical cultural production as expansively as possible, considering some of the forms in which bodies are othered through language, including through discourses of disability, gender performance, and other zones of often-felt difference and social dislocation. Though this is primarily a creative writing class, our writing will push itself outside its usual modes of expression. We will explore texts anthologized in the recent collection Troubling the Line, as well as in past collections, such as texts from The Black Arts Movement.  We will discuss and critique the rich tradition of &quot;somatic&quot; practices in the world of performance and live art, including the work of artists such as Marina Abramovic, and we will familiarize ourselves with important recent experiments in poetry and prose by authors such as kari edwards, Theresa Hak Kyung Cha, and Renee Gladmann. Our end goal will be to curate a show and live reading that provides us a space to test out some of our textual experiments.</p></description>

    <title>Undergraduate Research: Civic Intelligence Research and Action Laboratory (CIRAL)</title>
    <minimum_credits>6</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>6</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>Civic intelligence attempts to understand how &quot;smart&quot; a society is in addressing the issues it faces and to think about—and initiate—practices that improve this capacity. It is an interdisciplinary area of inquiry that includes the sciences—social and otherwise—as well as the humanities. Visual art, music, and stories, are as critical to the enterprise as the ability to analyze and theorize about social and environmental issues.</p><p>This learning opportunity is designed to allow students of various knowledge and skill levels to work with a high level of autonomy on the design and implementation of real-world research and action projects in virtually any field. Students will collaborate via issue-oriented &quot;clusters&quot; with students, faculty, and others inside and beyond Evergreen. The undergraduate research opportunity will help students develop important skills in organizational and workshop design, collaboration, analysis and interpretation, written and oral communication, critical thinking skills, and interpersonal skills. We also expect to focus on the development of online services, information, and tools, including civic engagement games and online deliberation.</p><p>Although there are many ways to engage in this research, all work will directly or indirectly support the work of the Civic Intelligence Research and Action Laboratory (CIRAL). These opportunities will include working with the &quot;Home Office.&quot; The home office work will focus on developing the capacities of the lab, including engaging in research, media work, or tech development that will support the community partnerships. Other work can include direct collaboration outside the classroom, often on an ongoing basis. We are also hoping to support students who are interested in the development of online support for civic intelligence, particularly CIRAL. This includes the development of ongoing projects such as e-Liberate, a web-based tool that supports online meetings using Roberts Rules of Order, and Activist Mirror, a civic engagement game, as well as the requirements gathering and development of new capabilities for information interchange and collaboration.</p></description>

    <title>Performing the Text: Creative Writing as Dissent</title>
    <minimum_credits>4</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>4</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>What does it mean to perform the text? What happens when genres collide? This creative writing program will bring together several terms often thought to be well-defined—including &quot;poetry,&quot; &quot;prose,&quot; &quot;theater,&quot; &quot;politics,&quot; and &quot;essay&quot;—and, through experiments in writing, reading, and collaborating, re-narrate their meanings and implications. Along the way we’ll investigate key concepts and texts in poets theater, guerilla poetry, and other forms of performance-based text by writers such as Kaia Sand, Hannah Weiner, Raul Zurita, and Tracie Morris, mining them to create our own individual and collaborative writings. During the quarter, our meetings will consist of weekly seminars, lectures, and &quot;language labs&quot;—times for brainstorming, rehearsing, and trying out language experiments.</p></description>

    <title>The Global Hunt for Civic Intelligence</title>
    <minimum_credits>8, 12</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>8, 12</maximum_credits>
    <description><p class="p1"><br/><span>This program focuses on the social phenomenon that we call &quot;civic intelligence.&quot; </span><br/><br/><span>It may seem elusive, yet civic intelligence is all around us — if we know what to look for. It can be seen locally — in a community garden project, for example — and it can be seen globally as well — addressing climate change, for example — and anywhere in between on issues such as education, social equity, or environmental restoration. </span><br/><br/><span>Civic intelligence is the ability of groups of diverse sizes and composition to address shared significant issues effectively and equitably. This can take the shape of new approaches to social service, such as Robert Eggers&apos; DC Kitchen. It can take the form of new initiatives such as the Sustainable Prisons Project that Evergreen helped launch or supporting economically disadvantaged neighborhoods to define and struggle for their own health objectives. Or &quot;democracy vouchers&quot; that were recently adopted in Seattle via the initiative process. These exciting examples just begin to scratch the surface of what it means to be civically intelligent.</span><br/><br/><span>While the term civic intelligence is not in common usage, the idea is not new. John Dewey, the American psychologist, philosopher, educator, social critic and political activist (whose insights helped inspire Evergreen&apos;s educational philosophy), was a proponent of the concept, although he didn&apos;t put a precise name on it. Nevertheless, the necessity—and the difficulties—of thinking and acting together are universal and require us to consider a wide variety of perspectives, including social movements, education, government and democracy, community studies, organizational studies, systems theory, and design. Because civic intelligence requires action, the program also requires active engagement. </span><br/><br/><span>We are using the metaphor of the hunt to focus on finding phenomena that&apos;s often hidden. We will also use the metaphor of an expedition as a broader, more holistic and organized approach to orienting our research and action. </span><br/><br/><span>In Fall quarter, we posed questions and used our social imagination to envision how our hunt might unfold. We identified, discussed, and analyzed potential projects and organizations that seemed to demonstrate civic intelligence, including efforts in our region. </span><br/><br/><span>In Winter and Spring quarters, we will continue the expedition through research and interaction and begin to evaluate, sum up, and think about ways that the work could continue to expand and evolve. How is the best way to record our findings? Or publicize them? How  should we communicate with other researchers and practitioners? In Spring we are tentatively planning to convene a public event in relation to our work. </span><br/><br/><span>Students who elect to take the 12 credit option will participate in the Civic Intelligence Research and Action Laboratory or CIRAL. The lab is designed to allow students of diverse interests and skills to work in issue-oriented &quot;clusters&quot; with students, faculty, and others inside and beyond Evergreen who are engaged in real-world projects that integrate research and action. These opportunities will also include developing the capacities of the CIRAL lab itself, including engaging in research, media work, or tech development. </span><br/><br/><span>Integrating theory and practice, we will learn civic intelligence by doing it. We will consciously leverage Evergreen&apos;s underlying philosophy as a nontraditional, experimental school to explore how students can take a more active role in their education and in their interactions in the world. Students in this program will take an active role in how the program is conducted. </span><br/><span><br/></span></p></description>

    <title>Art, Mindfulness and Psychology: Racial Identity through the Lifespan</title>
    <minimum_credits>8, 16</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>8, 16</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>This program will use art, psychology, and mindfulness to explore the intersectionality of race, racial identity and societal health. The practices of mindfulness and creating art can increase our individual and collective resiliency to be able to respond to racial identity issues and structural oppression in adaptive and creative ways.  Mindfulness and the body will be a central focus of the work.  In the studio, we will focus on building skills as well as the expressive qualities of art, to explore non-verbal ways of processing our readings, writings, and discussions about race. The program will integrate mindfulness through theory, practice and its application in relation to developmental psychology, racial identity, and art practice.  Questions to be explored include: How are mindfulness and art making being integrated into working with people at various developmental and racial identity stages of life?  How do systems of racial identity live in the individual, family, and social bodies?  How can the practices of mindfulness and creating art be integral to the healing of racism?</p><p>The program offers 16 and 8 credit options.  All students will explore racial identity through the lifespan by developing skills in mindfulness, drawing and ceramics through intensive studio practice. Students taking 16 credits will also study developmental psychology and related quantitative reasoning skills for social sciences. </p><p>In fall, the program will focus on child and adolescent developmental psychology. In the ceramics lab, students will work though the basic methods of forming in clay and learn essentials for glazing and firing.  Students will also be introduced to basic drawing skills. Constructive critique sessions on key pieces will help students to develop their ideas. In winter, students will focus on adult, geriatric and end of life developmental psychology. Building on the foundational skills and concepts in ceramics and drawing from the fall, students will develop a series of pieces that address the complexity of their own understanding of racial identity.</p><p>Students will have an opportunity to learn using diverse modalities and multiple intelligences.  The program will participate in in depth dialogue, art-making, writing assignments, theoretical tests for developmental psychology studies, and critical study of important texts. This program is designed as a two-quarter program of study preparatory for careers and further study in psychology, fine arts, art therapy, education and cultural studies.</p></description>

    <title>Introduction to Environmental Studies: Land</title>
    <minimum_credits>16</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>16</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>In this program, we will explore the complexities of environmental issues in terrestrial (land) environments. We will use climate change as a central theme, demonstrating how social phenomena and natural environments are intertwined. We will also explore how local forests and communities affect, and are affected by, climate change. We will focus especially on forests, which dominate the land-base of the Pacific Northwest, and are central to the evolving global agreements on climate change. Because environmental issues are not strictly science problems, and not strictly social problems, our focus will be equally divided between the social and natural sciences.</p><p>For the social science component, students will be introduced to several key approaches to examining the environment-society relationship, including explanations of the social determinants of the destruction of the environmental commons as well as their solutions. We will explore various theories about the environment-society relationship, including those that focus on population growth, economic growth, technological innovation, and social justice, using examples and case studies from the local and global environments as appropriate to illustrate concepts. Students will consequently develop familiarity with key debates in the broad field of the environmental social sciences, and develop the capability of engaging with this scholarly conversation by formulating and defending a well supported position in these contentious debates. Students will apply this learning to the context of the global atmospheric commons, critically evaluating policies to mitigate climate change, including those that involve carbon sequestration in forests. Student learning will be facilitated by a variety of texts, films, workshops and seminar discussion that will delve into these topics in various ways.</p><p>For the natural science component, students will learn about climate change and forest ecology from a carbon cycling perspective. Students will learn to do basic forest measurements, inventory carbon sequestration in forests, and identify the dominant tree and forest species of our region. Weekly field labs will give students hands-on experience working with our local forests in a series of permanent forest measurement plots in the Evergreen State College forest reserve. Students will then learn about how these measurements are related to global carbon budgets and how global carbon budgets are related to climate change.</p><p>Our studies will use a combination of weekly lectures in social science and forest ecology, data analysis labs, seminars, workshops, and weekly field labs to accomplish our goals. The program is also designed to give students a foundation for understanding multiple environmental issues such as conservation biology, pollution, invasive species biology, and bioengineering.</p><p><strong>This program will be repeated in winter quarter. Students who take this program in fall should not register for the winter quarter repeat.</strong></p></description>

    <description><p>Following Frankl&apos;s existentialist urgings toward hope and meaning, as well as the humanists’ emphasis on self-actualization, leading scholars in psychology founded &quot;positive psychology&quot; in 1998. Since that time, we now have a better understanding of humans at their best. This worldwide collaborative effort has attempted to balance early psychology’s focus on psychopathology. In this class, we will study correlates to life satisfaction and examine empirical science as well as practical strategies for promoting well being, quality of life, and resilience. Students will engage in experiential activities related to gratitude, hope, savoring, leadership, forgiveness, teamwork, curiosity, humor and playfulness, self-regulation, altruism, etc. The goal of this course is for students to develop a general body of knowledge (and experience) about the new social science regarding the more positive aspects of human existence. We will be “living” much of this material, so this information should be directly applicable to your personal and professional development.</p></description>

    <description><p>While art is clearly influenced by culture, it can also be influenced by place. This program explores place-based arts such as basketweaving, plant arts, and nature journaling, and their eco-cultural foundations. Students gain a basic understanding in several areas including Pacific Northwest ecosystems and their dominant plant species; Coast Salish culture, history, and traditional arts; and dominant ecosystems associated with an element of one’s own cultural heritage. Students also develop the ability to critically analyze and communicate relationships between place-based arts and the places with which they are associated.  During spring quarter, the new Indigenous Fiber Arts Studio opens its doors.  In preparation, students consider the form and function of the studio, the process of creating it, and influences of landscape on the building––as both a home for art and art itself––as well as influences of the building on the landscape. This leads us to exploration of landscape as interactive and place as relational, as we also help design and create “garden” spaces that support the Fiber Arts Studio.   </p></description>

    <description><p>This course will explore two beliefs that are strongly held by many Americans: that we have little to learn from other countries, and that we are better off going it alone rather than working through alliances or supranational organizations such as the United Nations. But the US has much to gain by learning from the administrative and policy experiences of other countries.  And problems such as climate change, strengthening the global financial system, and unequal development require global solutions and working through both international and supranational organizations.We will explore the theory and reality of such organizations: why they are needed but also why they are very difficult to manage and lead.  We will also compare the US with political and administrative systems elsewhere and examine how they have crafted policy solutions that provide useful examples for the US.  We will also study the challenges to performing comparative research, the role of nongovernmental organizations,  and the cultural knowledge/skills needed to work effectively at the global level.  We will use lectures, seminars, films and workshops to explore these issues.  </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p></description>

    <title>Social Entrepreneurs: The Unsung Heroes of Community Building</title>
    <minimum_credits>4</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>4</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>Managers of non-profit organizations ( also known as social entrepreneurs)  are the  unsung heroes of the newly developed concept of  “socially responsible capitalism” . They are the champions of social movements geared at helping to right the wrongs of the competitive  free-market  capitalist system. They are the social architects for community building and implementing culture changes throughout the world, and most of all, for correcting the social imbalances caused by the highly competitive global market. This course is for students with strong interests in the field of  business management of non-profit organizations, community building and organizational development. Its focus is to help build the student’s managerial skills needed for operating  successful and effective community-based organizations. Specifically this course will explore the following learning areas:</p><ol><li>Analyzing the shortcomings of the free- market capitalist system and the need for the social entrepreneurs as corrective agents.</li><li>Developing  business plans and grant proposals for non-profit enterprises</li><li>Understanding the basic accounting system for non-profit enterprises and preparing the organization’s financial statements and tax reports.</li><li>Marketing the products and/or services of non-profit enterprises</li><li>Managing effectively the human resources of non-profit organizations.</li><li>Communicating effectively across cultural boundaries</li><li>Promoting ethical behavior in the organization.</li><li>Assessing the role of International non-governmental Organizations (INGO) in the global economy.</li></ol><p>Students will have the opportunity to explore the issues, challenges and opportunities which arise from working with various types of businesses across the boundaries of cultural difference. This course is designed to facilitate learning through active involvement with real-world situations, and as such, Students will have the opportunity to explore the issues, challenges and opportunities which arise from working with various types of businesses across the boundaries of cultural difference. This course is designed to facilitate learning through active involvement with real-world situations, and as such, students are expected to perform an in-service learning project with a local business or nonprofit organization. At the end of the quarter, students are expected to present their in-service learning findings to the class.</p></description>

    <title>The History and Future of Experiments in Music and Theater</title>
    <minimum_credits>16</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>16</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>To look at an artwork as an experiment means to see how it was, in its time, a step towards what was new, uncertain or without evidence. The ways in which an experiment was brought about could happen in many different ways: with its content (the plot, the characters, the harmonies), with its structure (repetition or the lack of it, disturbing the natural sequence of events, undermining the form), or with other aspects of the material that makes up the artwork.</p><p>Both music and theater use time for their unfolding, and so, share aspects of composition and development. In our class, we&apos;ll be reading, listening to, and discussing artworks of the past and experiments of the present. Some of the older authors and composers we might study are Shakespeare, Shaw, Brecht, Mozart, Ravel and Schoenberg.  Some of the contemporary experimenters might be Robert Wilson, Pina Bausch, Adrianne Kennedy, Chaya Czernowin and Luigi Nono. From these conversations, we&apos;ll develop assignments and performance exercises for ourselves to create now.</p><p>Through a combination of seminars, a movement and gesture experimentation studio, coached rehearsals, lectures and presentations, shared attendance at performances, and our own performances, the class will study music and theater pieces – how they were experimental in their time, and how might we continue and move on from that experimentation in our time. We will make experimental works together using our growing awareness of what’s been done before and why.</p><p>As one center of activity during fall quarter, each student will participate in three group projects.  Each group will create a performance based on and in response to the experiments we&apos;ve studied. These performances will be presented to and discussed with the class. The question of “what is experimental now” will be a primary focus.</p><p>As a center of activity during winter quarter, each student will remain in one group for the entire quarter, as if forming a temporary company, and that group will develop their project and their ideas for &quot;what is experimental now&quot; for a final public performance. As their work develops over the quarter, each group will present its scripts, music, and rehearsals to the class, explaining their ideas and inviting discussion.</p><p>Each quarter, students will be asked to write a research paper, addressing some part of the authors, composers and artworks studied. A draft of the paper will be due in week 5, and a final version will be due in week 10. Primary emphasis will be placed on understanding of the intentions of the authors, composers and artists studied, and their contribution. Students will develop writing skills as an additional emphasis.</p></description>

      To complete their degree, MES students are required to complete a 16 credit thesis, the prospectus for which is finished in the Fall quarter during Case Studies. At the end of Case Studies, and prior to Winter quarter, students are assigned a faculty mentor, or &quot;reader.&quot;  Each reader is assigned a CRN (course reference number) for Winter quarter and a different CRN for Spring quarter, and students will be notified of their reader&apos;s CRN by email from the MES office prior to registration for each quarter.  Students will take eight thesis credits each quarter. In addition to the thesis, students are required to attend an evening thesis workshop, which is usually offered on occasional Tuesday or Thursday evenings throughout the Winter and Spring quarters.  Students will be notified of exact details during Fall quarter. See our
      <a href="http://www.evergreen.edu/mes/thesisresources.htm">Thesis Resources</a>
      page for more information.

    <description><p><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">Imagine every creative artifact—story, poem, essay, video essay—is the result of a process of radically optimistic disruption. Using writing, moving image and sound as modes of creative and critical inquiry, participants in this program will seek to understand and make use of the generative potential of processes that require a deliberate and mindful break, rupture or deviation from our sense of meaning and how it is represented and communicated. We will explore concepts and processes such as adaptation, recursion, translation, mutation, permutation, erasure, multiplication, fragmentation, hybridity, and more.</span></p><p>Over the course of two quarters, students will generate a body of creative work in text, moving image, and audio, engaging in a process-based interrogation of the relationships between form and content. Working iteratively, students will radically adapt their work in response to successive formal constraints designed to catalyze leaps of imagination, to inspire rigorous critical inquiry, to cultivate a deeper connection to individual voice, and to introduce a variety of creative forms and practices.</p><p>Program participants will learn about and develop skill with the elements of narrative, lyrical and time-based discourse through workshops, presentations, seminar, screenings, critique, and through iterative critical and creative writing assignments. Participants will experiment with different ways of engaging their work independently and as a community of artists: developing a sustaining creative practice, building and participating in an online community, and going away together for extended creative retreats.</p><p>Texts and assignments will facilitate deeper awareness of the relationship between critical and creative thought and practice. There will be a strong emphasis on writers and artists whose perspectives and work exist in the borderlands of identity, genre, and discipline. Authors and media artists currently being considered for the program reading list include Claudia Rankine, Lia Purpura, Bhanu Kapil, Susan Howe, Teresa Hak Kyung Cha, Pipilotti Rist, Laurie Simmons and others. </p></description>

    <title>Geopolitics, Energy, Economics and Stewardship of the Pacific Northwest</title>
    <minimum_credits>16</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>16</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>This program examines the political, ecological and energy-related foundations of the Pacific Northwest’s culture and economy. The unique mix of energy, natural resources, agriculture, manufacturing, military, high technology and finance have created a diverse cultural and economic base. The regional economy, led by manufacturing, agriculture, forest products and finance, served the region well during most of the 20th century, creating a variety of sources of employment and opportunities for families to achieve a high quality of life.</p><p>Changes in the late 20th and early 21st century present new challenges. As we explore these changes, our goals are to define a concrete vision of a sustainable economy in the Pacific Northwest that will account for employment, prosperity and preservation and restoration of the environment, as well as to examine the roles public policy and entrepreneurship can play to ensure it is achievable, and to understand why it is important to transition to a sustainable future. We believe innovation, creativity and stewardship will help achieve the goals of this program to positively benefit the region.</p><p>Three overarching topics will be explored in depth. Pacific Northwest energy regimes—including natural gas, hydroelectric sources and emerging technologies of tidal, geothermal and wind—will be examined. Energy is vital to the Pacific Northwest because of the comparative advantages on price the region has long enjoyed. We will examine the composition of, and changes in, the regional economy, including how to understand key economic relationships, how technology and other emerging sectors impact education, demographics, employment, wage structures and demands for infrastructure and tax base. To fully understand energy and the regional economy, we will integrate considerations of how economics, governance and ecology are now at critical turning points.</p><p>This program is organized around class work that includes lectures, workshops, book seminars and field trips. Assignments will include seminar papers, field trip reports, briefing papers, individual and team research and a final project and presentation.</p></description>

    <title>Plant Chemical Ecology: The Secret Life of Plants</title>
    <minimum_credits>16</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>16</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>In order to survive, organisms need to obtain energy, successfully reproduce, and avoid their enemies. The survival strategies of animals often include movement: stalking prey, visually or audibly communicating, or escaping/avoiding their enemies. Plants, however, cannot rely on movement-based strategies since they are rooted in place. So how can plants survive if they cannot run away when threatened? Do they communicate with other organisms? What can they do to attract mates or beneficial partners? The key to these questions can be found in a more subtle strategy used by plants: the production of a vast array of chemical compounds, known as plant hormones and secondary metabolites.</p><p>These plant chemicals serve as the basis for plant communication within their ecosystems by mediating interactions between plants and mutualists such as pollinators, seed dispersers, and microbial partners as well as enemies such as pathogens, herbivores, and competitors. This program will focus on increasing students&apos; understanding of “the secret life of plants”- that is, the the unseen chemical world of plants that ultimately determines the distribution, abundance, and diversity of species in an ecosystem. Lectures, labs, and seminar readings will focus on topics in plant morphology, physiology, chemistry, and ecology including a survey of the major classes of secondary metabolites found in plants and their known ecological functions as well their distribution in major plant families.</p><p>In labs, students with have the opportunity to practice techniques and experiments in plant chemistry for separating and analyzing mixtures of secondary metabolites, such as extraction, distillation, and chromatography. In botany and plant physiology labs, students will become familiar with family-level characteristics of major groups of plants, as well as learn techniques for measuring plant growth and plant response to stress using plant chemical bioassays and culturing techniques for plant pathogenic and symbiotic fungi. Students will participate in group and individual research projects focusing on topics in plant chemical ecology that may include data collection and analysis, scientific writing, and library research. Group research projects will culminate in contributing to the program’s popular science blog and a final group presentation.</p></description>

    <description><p>In what ways do our positive emotions/perceptions enhance our ability to see reality? Are there effective methods for training the mind to cultivate positive thought/emotions? Students will analyze the nature of constructive emotion/thoughts, their influence on our mental stability and brain physiology, and methodologies for influencing and improving mental development and function. Students will explore the correlation between mental training of the mind and physiological changes in the brain. We will also examine the nature of the genuine happiness from Eastern and Western psychological models of mind/emotion as well as from a traditional epistemological model of cognition based on Indo-Tibetan studies.</p></description>

    <title>Introduction to Environmental Studies: Water</title>
    <minimum_credits>16</minimum_credits>

    <description><p><strong>This program is a repeat of the program in fall quarter.  Students who take the program in fall should not register for the winter quarter program.</strong></p><p>This program is designed to serve as a foundation for advanced programs in environmental studies. As such, it will survey a range of disciplines and skills essential for environmental problem-solving from both a scientific and social science perspective. Specifically, we will study ecological principles and methods, aquatic ecology, methods of analysis in environmental studies, American political and economic history of environmental policy-making, microeconomics, and political science. This information will be used to analyze current issues on a range of topics in environmental studies.</p><p>The focus of this program will be on aquatic systems. We will examine the major physical and chemical characteristics of aquatic environments and factors controlling species diversity, distribution, and productivity of aquatic organisms. Current issues such as marine pollution, harmful algal blooms, over-fishing, and global climate change will be discussed. These scientific issues will be grounded in the context of politics, economics, and public policy. In addition, we will examine how the values of democracy and capitalism from the founding era to the present influence resource management, and the scope and limitations of governmental policy-making, regulatory agencies, and environmental law. Understanding the different levels (federal, state, local) of governmental responsibility for environmental protection will be explored in-depth. Field trips, seminar, and case studies will offer opportunities to see how science and policy interact in environmental issues. Finally, we will introduce quantitative methods relevant to environmental studies.</p><p>Material will be presented through lectures, seminars, labs, field trips/field work, and quantitative methods. Laboratory and field trips will examine microscopic life in aquatic systems and will examine the ecology of estuarine habitats.</p></description>

    <maximum_credits>16</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>Neuroscience continues to be one of the fastest growing areas of biology and is at the cutting edge of technical and conceptual advances in the life sciences. If you want to know how animals (including humans) touch, hear, see, smell, and remember things, then you need to study ions, molecules, cells, neural networks, brain structure and behavior. We will first learn about the function of the brain’s cellular computers: neurons. We will learn how neurons differ from other cells, how they generate electrical signals, and how they communicate with one another via synapses. We will then investigate how neurons cooperate in circuits by studying five sensory systems: vision, touch, hearing, taste and smell. Cellular and molecular mechanisms will be emphasized alongside the physics and mathematics of neurobiology. In the mathematics workshops we will study linear, exponential, and logarithmic functions using a problem-solving approach to college algebra. Collaborative learning will be emphasized. Strong emphasis will be placed on developing students&apos; quantitative skills in order that they be prepared to undertake future scientific programs.</p><p>Our learning goals will include development of analytical and critical thinking, quantitative reasoning, reading, and writing skills. Weekly activities will include lectures, presentations, labs, workshops, and seminars. Students will be required to submit weekly homework assignments, lab and workshop reports, and seminar papers and to contribute actively to the learning community. Students who successfully complete the math portion of the program will receive five credits of Algebraic Thinking for Science and be prepared for precalculus I.</p><p><strong>Note: This program will be repeated spring quarter.  Students taking the program winter quarter should not register for the spring repeat.</strong></p></description>

    <description><p>In Introduction to Woodworking, students will engage in the foundational skills necessary to produce a piece of artisan furniture safely. Study will include design elements and concepts, fabrication methodogy, aesthetic and working properties of wood species, finish types and their application, assembly techniques, and machine and hand tool skills, and an introduction to artisan furniture as a means of personal expression. Given the basic materials necessary to produce a small table, students will develop design options within the parameters set by the volume and species of wood to be used, develop necessary fabrication skills, and produce a small side table using basic joinery techniques.</p></description>

    <description><p>When is a thing a thing, and when is it nothing? On what objects do we place importance and why? How do we establish the use or uselessness of objects? In a creative practice, how do we know when something we have been working on is complete?</p><p>During this spring quarter program, we will consider our relationship to objects and object making. We will study and discuss skill and deskilling in the arts, and material hierarchy and contingency. With the goal of developing a personal visual vocabulary, participants will begin by discussing what we admire and collect, while considering and questioning our aesthetic predispositions. Students will quickly move on to create a collection of completed objects, using material experiments to develop their ideas and explore the line between what makes a piece done or undone. In the fine metalsmithing studio we will focus on hollow form techniques, advanced construction, and joining skills. Using mixed media in the context of metalsmithing will also be investigated, and discussed alongside broad considerations of material use, value, hoarding, and waste.</p><p>Students in this program should look forward to spending a significant amount of time outside of class working on studio work. We will attend the Evergreen Art Lecture Series, and weekly seminars, lectures and workshops will center on discussions of craft, art, and design. Reading and writing in preparation for weekly seminars will feed visual and material research done in the studio. Regular work reviews will encourage listening, group problem solving, and thoughtful critique.  The development of a regular drawing practice will be emphasized and students will keep a sketchbook specific to the program.</p><p>By the end of the program, students will have developed a portfolio of writings, illustrations, and images related to their studio investigations, and will edit and produce a supplemental printed companion to the physical series of work made throughout the quarter.</p></description>

    <title>Design Thinking for Public Service</title>
    <minimum_credits>4</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>4</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>In this course, we apply a design thinking perspective to contemporary administrative, social, and physical problems and challenges. Design thinking brings together people from different disciplines to effectively explore, in collaboration, human-centered approaches to contemporary challenges. While we&apos;ll study the theory of design thinking, the main focus of this course is on the application of design thinking in communities and administration. We will examine both design as a physical element to create/make/sustain communities as well as design as a method for social innovation, service delivery, and management. We&apos;ll study design thinking, cases of social and communal innovation using design thinking, and work together to apply design thinking to real-world situations. Our learning laboratory is the City of Tenino. This course is applicable for students interested in social and administrative innovation, city planning, and community building.</p></description>

    <title>Social Entrepreneurs: The Unsung Heroes of Community Building</title>
    <minimum_credits>4</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>4</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>Managers of non-profit organizations ( also known as social entrepreneurs)  are the  unsung heroes of the newly developed concept of  “socially responsible capitalism.” They are the champions of social movements geared at helping to right the wrongs of the competitive  free-market  capitalist system. They are the social architects for community building and implementing culture changes throughout the world, and most of all, for correcting the social imbalances caused by the highly competitive global market. This course is for students with strong interests in the field of  business management of non-profit organizations, community building and organizational development. Its focus is to help build the student’s managerial skills needed for operating  successful and effective community-based organizations. Specifically this course will explore the following learning areas:</p><ol><li>Analyzing the shortcomings of the free- market capitalist system and the need for the social entrepreneurs as corrective agents.</li><li>Developing  business plans and grant proposals for non-profit enterprises</li><li>Understanding the basic accounting system for non-profit enterprises and preparing the organization’s financial statements and tax reports.</li><li>Marketing the products and/or services of non-profit enterprises</li><li>Managing effectively the human resources of non-profit organizations.</li><li>Communicating effectively across cultural boundaries</li><li>Promoting ethical behavior in the organization.</li><li>Assessing the role of International non-governmental Organizations (INGO) in the global economy.</li></ol><p>Students will have the opportunity to explore the issues, challenges and opportunities which arise from working with various types of businesses across the boundaries of cultural difference. This course is designed to facilitate learning through active involvement with real-world situations, and as such, students are expected to perform an in-service learning project with a local business or nonprofit organization. At the end of the quarter, students are expected to present their in service learning findings to the class.</p></description>

    <minimum_credits>16</minimum_credits>

    <description><p>In this program in experimental creative writing, two-dimensional design and visual and literary theory, we will work to look past the commodity function of art toward more social, political, and utopian possibilities.  In doing so, we will emphasize the importance of the gifting traditions that weave together individuals and communities in Northwest Indigenous nations, as well as the push for new languages and alternative routes for circulation in and among poetic communities. Along the way, we will engage in artistic research, drawing and digital design, as well as pursue experiments in constraint-based writing, close reading, and academic essay writing.</p><p>Through two-dimensional drawing and design we will explore and research the historical and contemporary perspectives of traditional and innovative Indigenous artists from the Pacific Northwest regions.  We will address diverse visual languages, design strategies, pattern recognition, and regional traditions. Working only on paper, students will learn to create unique images and illustrations that are guided by the principles and elements of design. Students will create a conceptual body of work that will interact with their creative writing practice.</p><p>In our creative writing practice, we will explore how collecting, shaping and re-shaping found language might bring the surprise of self-recognition, strike a familiar chord in an unfamiliar way. We will ask how working within the constraints of found or overheard textual material might disrupt our senses of self and offer new ways of accessing one another and our shared symbolic order. In an attempt to produce creative work differently, our creative writing will take up experimental procedures, e.g., using source texts as material to manipulate, distort, transform and otherwise “translate” language using combinatorial play, de-structuring and re-structuring.  Students will spend the quarter working on a series of creative writing pieces that will be brought together, edited and self-published as individual “chapbooks” in our end-of-the-quarter final creative writing projects.</p><p>We invite students to take up these practices in the spirit of collaboration and art-making beyond the acquisition of skills.  We will situate our practices in relation to the dominant art canon and contemporary world(s) of art.  We will also work to develop different forms of literacies, including poetic, visual, cultural and political.</p><p>
      In art history and practice, we will read from texts such as
      <em>S&apos;abadeb the Gifts: Pacific Coast Salish Art and Artists</em>
      ,
      <em>Contemporary Coast Salish Art</em>
      , and
      <em>The Truth About Stories: A Native Narrative.</em><em> </em>
      Our literary and poetic interlocutors will likely include recent and contemporary critical theorists, poets, and philosophers such as Derrida, Barthes, Blanchot, Sianne Ngai, Lyn Hejinian, Kwame Anthony Appiah, as well as Freud, Kristeva, and others.
    </p><p><strong>This program will be repeated in winter and spring quarters. Students who take this program in fall should not register for the winter or spring quarter repeat.</strong></p></description>

    <description><p>Policymakers at the state and national levels are deeply concerned that some students in public schools succeed while others don&apos;t. They seek to address this achievement gap by legislating curriculum that focuses on ensuring – among other aims – that all children read and write at a certain level by a certain age. At the same time, policy-makers, educators, and parents face the reality that children&apos;s abilities to benefit from opportunities to learn are affected by systemic biases related to ethnicity, class, and a wide range of learning and developmental needs.  To help illuminate these conflicting realities and discover possible ways to make education more meaningful for more children and youth, this program will focus on theories of child development, how the structures and development of the brain impact learning, the impact of race and class on access to learning opportunities, and ways to support the cognitive, social, and emotional development of the range of students who attend public schools, including those with special needs. </p><p>Learning opportunities in this program will include reading a range of texts, creating written and other visual responses to and analyses of the texts, participating in workshops, completing a self-as-learner project, and producing and presenting a culminating project about an area of interest related to the program content.</p></description>

    <title>Furniture Design I</title>
    <minimum_credits>4</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>4</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>Furniture design I is a course in the preparation and construction of a piece of furniture of the student’s original design. Students enrolling in this course must have successfully completed Introduction to Woodworking or have significant prior experience in joinery and fabrication in wood, and the instructor’s authorization. In Furniture Design I, students will be introduced to furniture design from an historical perspective. Emphasis will be placed on the mid-nineteenth century to the present day, noting the progression and the enduring qualities of philosophy, design concepts and fabrication methodologies. Our study will focus on designers and makers from the Arts and Crafts movement, the International Style, Art Deco, Mid-Century Modern, Craft Revival, and artisan furniture makers of the Pacific Northwest. Students will develop original designs through engaging in the design process; consultation with the instructor and their design team members, defining design parameters, sketching design ideas, critiquing design options among the design teams, producing scale drawings, cut lists and fabrication sequences; and production of a scale model of their final design.</p></description>

    <title>The Geography of Polar Regions</title>
    <minimum_credits>16</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>16</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>This program focuses on the regional dynamics that form the environmental conditions of the Arctic and Antarctic. The two regions share similar and contrasting physical and social settings.  The Arctic is an ocean surrounded by land and has been inhabited by indigenous peoples for approximately 10,000 years with increasing Euro-American dominance in the last 100 years.  In contrast, Antarctic is a continent surrounded by ocean and has only been sporadically inhabited by humans. This program will investigate the interactions of the physical conditions, exploration, economic attractiveness, political conditions, and indigenous populations of the two sub-regions.</p><p>The program will focus on the Arctic during fall quarter. This region is a complicated mixture of seawater, sea ice, isolated islands, and land areas surrounded by eight nations. The physical geography of the area is being strongly affected by warming temperatures. Newly accessible natural resources and healthy fisheries challenge indigenous populations as countries attempt to control these resources. We will investigate the role of the Arctic Council as the political organization in “control” of the Arctic region. Students will deliberate in a mock Arctic Council to understand indigenous relations with Euro-American political states, impacts of changing land uses, the role of research in decision-making, and the globalization of the Arctic.  Our learning will be enhanced by a multi-day trip to the North Cascades Institute and National Park.</p><p>We will examine Antarctica in winter quarter and compare it with the Arctic. Antarctica is governed by a 1958 treaty that emphasizes peace and scientific research.  Established research stations and tourism operations bring thousands of people to the continent each year, introducing conflict and exploratory activities that defy the intent of the treaty. We examine the development of the whaling industry, the physical geography, sea ice, climate and climate change, animal life including extremophiles, explorations and claiming of the continent, and contemporary political and economic activities in the sub-region.</p><p>Students will develop knowledge of physical and social processes that have defined the two regions, compare and contrast regional differences, and gain experience in scientific methods including quantitative and qualitative research, and geographic information systems (GIS). Students will participate in field trips to local sites with polar conditions. Guest speakers and multi-media presentations will provide further polar learning. Student learning will be measured by participation and completion of lab work, participation in field trips, note-taking and journal writing, research projects, and participation in lecture, seminar and workshops.</p></description>

    <title>The Narrative Tableau: Conceptual Strategies in Studio Photography</title>
    <minimum_credits>16</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>16</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>This program will explore the range of challenges, problems and possibilities in conceptualizing, constructing, and photographing in a studio environment. Students can expect to use a broad range of materials (cameras, printing techniques, etc.) but all shooting will remain on film (35mm, medium, and large format). While students can expect to print from those negatives in traditional black and white and color darkrooms, the program will also cover the process of scanning negatives and producing digital prints from those scans. The primary focus of the program will be how to formulate the outlines of a cohesive body of work, conduct research for that content, and for students to ultimately produce images based on that research in a controlled, studio environment.</p><p>We will employ strategies for challenging basic assumptions about the role and lexicon of the constructed image as well as immerse ourselves in the rich history of narrative tableaus (still lifes, historical paintings, etc.) as they have developed over the course of art history. Students will be asked to place their work and ideas within the context of contemporary photography and contemporary art, more generally, as the photograph has become an almost ubiquitous surrogate for lived experience. Students will be especially challenged to confront how their photographs are situated within the context of representation and depiction (addressing the inevitable conclusion that all images are, at their core, political in one way or another).</p><p>Students will be responsible for providing a written statement regarding their final body of work, which will reflect the quarter’s accumulation of research, transformation, and final production. Students can expect to edit down their quarter’s worth of images to 8-11 final photographs, which will constitute their final body of work. There will be weekly lectures, critiques, and seminars in addition to workshops and studio time. Students will also be required to attend the weekly Critical and Cultural Theory lecture series. Students can expect weekly reading assignments followed with written responses and formal participation in each seminar.</p></description>

    <description><p>From the molecular structure of DNA to the development of the telescope, this introductory level one-quarter program will explore historic breakthroughs and discoveries in science and medicine. Through lectures, seminars, inquiry-based laboratories, and writing workshops we will study the lives and works of people who pursued groundbreaking research and contributed to our modern understanding of science and the natural world. Students will learn about their varied life experiences, struggles and achievements, as well as the way their work was influenced by social trends and historic events. Our readings, discussions, and expository writing assignments will be concerned with integrating and interpreting these themes. This work will emphasize critical thinking as well as the development of proficient writing and speaking skills. This program is intended for students seeking to gain a general introduction to the biology, chemistry, history, and philosophy behind some major advancements in science as part of a liberal arts education. This program will provide a strong framework for students to be successful in subsequent lower division science programs.</p></description>

    <minimum_credits>16</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>16</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>To look at things as a system simply means to notice how the change of a part can change the whole. What implications does this have in the worlds of music and movement, social behavior, and theater? How does looking at something as a system change the thing we look at? How does it influence our ideas and actions? This program invites students who are interested in investigating the idea of system as well as creating systems of composition in sound and movement.</p><p>One cybernetic concept we&apos;ll explore is that of emerging properties. How can we, as composers of movement and of sound, compose the smallest elements so that their dynamic result is significantly different from their individual behavior? In other words, can we compose the dynamics of a system so that its resulting whole is not merely sum of its parts? And does this attitude towards composition mirror in some fashion the workings of the world we live in?</p><p>The readings that we will study range from aesthetics to anthropology and from the mathematics of information theory to the biology of cognition. Students should be prepared to address some difficult texts, ones that richly give back with careful reading.</p><p>Students will collaborate on a group composition project, a group research project, and a solo performance project during the quarter. They will also participate in weekly readings, seminars, and workshops in music and movement notations systems and scores, theater, and the study of cybernetics.</p><p>Among the authors we will read are: Gregory Bateson, Samuel Beckett, Bertolt Brecht, and Ludwig Wittgenstein. There will also be a readings packet containing articles by Herbert Brün, Friedrich Engels, Franz Kafka, Humberto Maturana, Heinz von Foerster, and Warren Weaver.</p><p>The combination of fiction, scientific research, and philosophy will allow us to learn about the range and the reach of cybernetics, and the range and the reach of our creative potential.</p></description>

    <minimum_credits>16</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>16</maximum_credits>
    <description><p><strong>This program is a repeat of the program in fall quarter.  Students who take the program in fall should not register for the winter quarter program.</strong></p><p>In this program, we will explore the complexities of environmental issues in terrestrial (land) environments.  We will use climate change as a central theme, demonstrating how social phenomena and natural environments are intertwined. We will also explore how local forests and communities affect, and are affected by, climate change. We will focus especially on forests, which dominate the land-base of the Pacific Northwest, and are central to the evolving global agreements on climate change. Because environmental issues are not strictly science problems, and not strictly social problems, our focus will be equally divided between the social and natural sciences.</p><p>For the social science component, students will be introduced to several key approaches to examining the environment-society relationship, including explanations of the social determinants of the destruction of the environmental commons as well as their solutions.  We will explore various theories about the environment-society relationship, including those that focus on population growth, economic growth, technological innovation, and social justice, using examples and case studies from the local and global environments as appropriate to illustrate concepts. Students will consequently develop familiarity with key debates in the broad field of the environmental social sciences, and develop the capability of engaging with this scholarly conversation by formulating and defending a well supported position in these contentious debates. Students will apply this learning to the context of the global atmospheric commons, critically evaluating policies to mitigate climate change, including those that involve carbon sequestration in forests. Student learning will be facilitated by a variety of texts, films, workshops and seminar discussion that will delve into these topics in various ways.</p><p>For the natural science component, students will learn about climate change and forest ecology from a carbon cycling perspective. Students will learn to do basic forest measurements, inventory carbon sequestration in forests, and identify the dominant tree and forest species of our region. Weekly field labs will give students hands-on experience working with our local forests in a series of permanent forest measurement plots in the Evergreen State College forest reserve. Students will then learn about how these measurements are related to global carbon budgets and how global carbon budgets are related to climate change.</p><p>Our studies will use a combination of weekly lectures in social science and forest ecology, data analysis labs, seminars, workshops, and weekly field labs to accomplish our goals.  The program is also designed to give students a foundation for understanding multiple environmental issues such as conservation biology, pollution, invasive species biology, and bioengineering.</p></description>

    <minimum_credits>4</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>4</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>This four-credit module (weekend only) of the 16-credit program Psychology and Mindfulness will focus on clinical applications of mindfulness. Mindfulness will be explored through theoretical, applied and expressive arts projects. In addition, students in enrolled in the sixteen-credit module (week days and weekend) will also look at how these dimensions of mindfulness interface with developmental and abnormal psychology. Sixteen-credit students will study abnormal psychology and see how mindfulness is being integrated into the treatment of mental illness, pain, addictions, hypertension, and other health conditions. Students will also study quantitative reasoning skills for social sciences.</p><p> </p><p>For CRNs, please see the Psychology and Mindfulness 16-credit catalog listing:</p><p><a href="http://www.evergreen.edu/catalog/2016-17/programs/psychologyandmindfulness-14248">http://www.evergreen.edu/catalog/2016-17/programs/psychologyandmindfulness-14248</a></p></description>

    <minimum_credits>16</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>16</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>This program is designed to serve as a foundation for advanced programs in environmental studies. As such, it will survey a range of disciplines and skills essential for environmental problem-solving from both a scientific and social science perspective. Specifically, we will study ecological principles and methods, aquatic ecology, methods of analysis in environmental studies, American political and economic history of environmental policy-making, microeconomics, and political science. This information will be used to analyze current issues on a range of topics in environmental studies.</p><p>The focus of this program will be on aquatic systems. We will examine the major physical and chemical characteristics of aquatic environments and factors controlling species diversity, distribution, and productivity of aquatic organisms. Current issues such as marine pollution, harmful algal blooms, over-fishing, and global climate change will be discussed. These scientific issues will be grounded in the context of politics, economics, and public policy. In addition, we will examine how the values of democracy and capitalism from the founding era to the present influence resource management, and the scope and limitations of governmental policy-making, regulatory agencies, and environmental law. Understanding the different levels (federal, state, local) of governmental responsibility for environmental protection will be explored in-depth. Field trips, seminar, and case studies will offer opportunities to see how science and policy interact in environmental issues. Finally, we will introduce quantitative methods relevant to environmental studies.</p><p>Material will be presented through lectures, seminars, labs, field trips/field work, and quantitative methods. Laboratory and field trips will examine microscopic life in aquatic systems and will examine the ecology of estuarine habitats.</p><p><b>This program will be repeated in winter quarter.  Students who take this program in fall should not register for the winter quarter repeat.</b></p></description>

    <description><p>Participants in this program will engage creative writing—their own and that of published authors—as a nexus for critical and creative inquiry, delving into the content and characteristics that mark the work and words of women writing today in very different voices from different perspectives. What are women saying to us—about themselves, about us, about the world? How do fiction, creative nonfiction, and poetry serve as modes of critical engagement? What can we say in these modes that can’t be said any other way? How do we as readers and writers of any gender or sexual identification listen to what is said by women? How can we respond? How do we speak for ourselves and for others?</p><p>Program participants will &quot;locate&quot; themselves and their work in a cultural and critical context, and will contribute to the discourse of contemporary writers. We will study and practice the elements of narrative and lyrical discourse through workshops, presentations, seminar, critique and through iterative critical and creative writing assignments. There will be an emphasis on formal hybridity, the relationship between critical and creative thought and practice,  as well as on development of a sustaining creative writing practice. Participants will experiment with different ways of engaging their work independently and as a community of artists: developing a daily writing practice, building and participating in an online community, and going away together to the Washington coast for a 4-day writing retreat.</p><p>Participants will develop two significant creative projects throughout the quarter, and will work together to conduct a research project on a set of women writers they agree on together as a way of extending and augmenting our shared reading list; using primary creative texts, secondary critical texts, and biographical works they will conduct a rich and dimensionally complex investigation.</p><p>Authors currently being considered for the program reading list include Claudia Rankine, Lidia Yuknavich, Maggie Nelson, Bhanu Kapil, Lia Purpura, Anne Carson, and others. </p></description>

    <title>Do Organizations Really Need HR?</title>
    <minimum_credits>4</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>4</maximum_credits>
    <description><p><span>
        With many firms now implementing full employee self service functions and subcontracting other HR traditional roles and responsibilities, is there a need for the HR department in organizations?  This course 
        <span>
          explores the position of HR, investigating pivotal questions such as: does making HR a separate business function still make sense? Should HR return to a narrower personnel role? Should key areas like talent management be reassigned to leadership and management functions outside of HR? What about strategic and legal roles of HR? This course also discusses whether or not there is an opportunity for a more integrated and leaner HR function. Students in this course will learn about the traditional and contemporaneity role that HR plays in the flatter and less centralized organizations and research and develop strategies that can be used to integrate this role into other functions. The primary objective of this course is to develop a HR model that better fits the needs of emerging organizations in the new economy.
          <span>This course provides students with the opportunity to practice critical thinking, reflecting, collaborating, researching and learning through individual and group activities, discussions and seminars, and team projects.</span>

    <title>Organizational Behavior: Attitude, Behavior, Impact</title>
    <minimum_credits>4</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>4</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>People in organizations are its ultimate competitive advantage.  It is, however, a challenge to predict human behavior in groups and within organizations. Organizational behavior (OB) studies individuals, groups, and structures and their interactions in organizations.  OB is an interdisciplinary field that includes sociology, psychology, anthropology, ethics, information technology, economics, communication, and management. Learning OB allows leaders and managers understand, explain, influence and predict human behavior.  This course is designed to expose students to critical theories and conceptual models of OB for analyzing, understanding, and managing human behavior within organizations. Through readings, seminars, small group activities, research, reflection journals, and a final project, students in this course will learn the foundations and underlying theoretical frameworks that impact individual and group attitudes and behaviors and increase their critical thinking skills to identify, analyze, and predict individual and group behavior within organizations. </p></description>

    <title>Making Change: Business Management in Turbulent Times</title>
    <minimum_credits>16</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>16</maximum_credits>
    <description><p class="p1">The title of this upper-division business program is intended to convey that we will study two aspects of “making change.”  Our primary focus will be on making change in the sense of how to respond to new challenges, foreseen or unforeseen, in the business environment.  We will consider both how to anticipate and respond to these challenges and also how to design an organizational structure that is resilient enough to adapt readily to whatever comes along.  We will also look at the need for and techniques of managing the routine aspects of a business or organization – that is, making change as represented by what happens (used to happen?) at the cash register during a business transaction.  If the manager doesn’t look after these sometimes boring and generally routine tasks the organization will founder.  While we will deal with business, most of what we study will apply also to government and nonprofit organizations.</p></description>

    <title>An Ethics of Generosity: Community In and Through Creative Writing, 2D Design and Visual and Literary Theory</title>
    <minimum_credits>16</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>16</maximum_credits>
    <description><p><strong>This program is a repeat of the program in fall quarter.  Students who take the program in fall should not register for the winter quarter program.</strong></p><p>In this program in experimental creative writing, two-dimensional design and visual and literary theory, we will work to look past the commodity function of art toward more social, political, and utopian possibilities.  In doing so, we will emphasize the importance of the gifting traditions that weave together individuals and communities in Northwest Indigenous nations, as well as the push for new languages and alternative routes for circulation in and among poetic communities. Along the way, we will engage in artistic research, drawing and digital design to include Adobe Photoshop and InDesign, as well as pursue experiments in constraint-based writing, close reading, and academic essay writing.</p><p>Through two-dimensional drawing and design we will explore and research the historical and contemporary perspectives of traditional and innovative Indigenous artists from the Pacific Northwest regions.  We will address diverse visual languages, design strategies, pattern recognition, and regional traditions. Working only on paper, students will learn to create unique images and illustrations that are guided by the principles and elements of design. Students will create a conceptual body of work that will interact with their creative writing practice.</p><p>In our creative writing practice, we will explore how collecting, shaping and re-shaping found language might bring the surprise of self-recognition, strike a familiar chord in an unfamiliar way. We will ask how working within the constraints of found or overheard textual material might disrupt our senses of self and offer new ways of accessing one another and our shared symbolic order. In an attempt to produce creative work differently, our creative writing will take up experimental procedures, e.g., using source texts as material to manipulate, distort, transform and otherwise “translate” language using combinatorial play, de-structuring and re-structuring.  Students will spend the quarter working on a series of creative writing pieces that will be brought together, edited and self-published as individual “chapbooks” in our end-of-the-quarter final creative writing projects.</p><p>We invite students to take up these practices in the spirit of collaboration and art-making beyond the acquisition of skills.  We will situate our practices in relation to the dominant art canon and contemporary world(s) of art.  We will also work to develop different forms of literacies, including poetic, visual, cultural and political.</p><p>
      In art history and practice, we will read from texts such as
      <em>S&apos;abadeb the Gifts: Pacific Coast Salish Art and Artists</em>
      ,
      <em>Contemporary Coast Salish Art</em>
      , Bill Holm&apos;s
      <i>Northwest Coast Indian Art</i>
      , and selections from Bill Reid&apos;s 
      <i>Solitary Raven</i>
      . Our literary and poetic interlocutors will likely include recent and contemporary critical theorists, poets, and philosophers such as Jordan Abel, dg nanouk okpik, Lyn Hejinian, Adam Phillips, as well as Saussure, Wittgenstein, Freud, and others.
    </p><p><strong>This program will be repeated in spring quarter. Students who take this program in winter should not register for the spring quarter repeat.</strong></p></description>

    <description><p>How do trees, and forest communities, function? What makes them tick? What determines the tallest trees in the world? What makes trees some of the oldest organisms on earth? These and many other questions about trees have long captivated humans. In this program, we will closely examine trees in their variety of form and function. We will use our studies to learn how understanding of tree form and function integrates study of botany, mathematics, physics, chemistry, geography and ecology.</p><p>Our studies will be divided between those that focus on individual trees, forests and whole forests. We will also read classic and recent texts about human interactions with trees and how our relationships to trees still help shape our collective identities and cultures. Students will learn how to read and interpret recent scientific studies from peer-reviewed journals and be challenged to reconcile popular belief about the roles of trees with scientific observations. Day trips, workshops, labs and a multiple-day field trip will allow us to observe some of the largest trees on the West Coast and observe and measure trees in extreme environments. Communication skills will be emphasized, particularly reading scientific articles and writing for scientific audiences. We will also practice skills for communicating to a broader public using nonfiction and technical writing.</p></description>

    <title>Gateways for Incarcerated Youth: Acknowledging the Past, Claiming the Future</title>
    <minimum_credits>16</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>16</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>This program offers Evergreen students the opportunity to co-learn with individuals incarcerated in a medium/maximum-security institution for juvenile males institution (Green Hill Institution in Chehalis, Washington). It is high stakes work that demands consistent engagement and self reflection—approximately 10-12 hours a week in class and 4-6 hours a week at the institution (including travel time) and a 20 hour a quarter involvement in other activities (such as fundraising) that help support and expand the educational resources available to the incarcerated youth.</p><p>A fundamental principle of the Gateways program is that every person has talents and valuable experiences that can contribute to our shared learning. It is our job as human creatures to encourage each other to seek out and develop our passions and gifts. These values are manifested in the practices of popular education, central to our work in the prison classroom.</p><p>Our goal is to create an environment in which each person becomes empowered to share their knowledge, creativity, values and goals by connecting respectfully with people from other cultural and class backgrounds. The main feature of popular education is that it empowers those seeking education to be the local experts in shaping their own course of study. Popular education works through conscientization, the ongoing process of joining with others to examine socioeconomic conditions, to reflect critically on those conditions, and thereby to imagine new possibilities for living. In order to do this work successfully, students will practice learning how to meet other learners &quot;where they are at&quot; (literally, in order to better understand the conditions that put some of us in prisons and others in colleges). Students will also develop or hone their skills in contextualizing and analyzing socioeconomic phenomena. Most importantly, students will learn that solidarity does not mean &quot;saving&quot; other people or solving their problems—it means creating conditions that allow them to articulate those problems through genuine dialogue and supporting them as they work toward their own solutions.</p><p>Program participants will have the opportunity to reflect on how different individuals access and manifest their learning as they gain experience in facilitating discussions and workshops. In the process of collectively shaping the Gateways seminar, they will also learn how to organize productive meetings and work through conflict. Students will take increasing responsibility for designing, implementing and assessing the program workshops and seminars. Throughout the program we will seek to expand our collective knowledge about various kinds of relative advantage or privilege while continually working to create a space that is welcoming and generative for all learners.</p><p>High stakes community-based work requires trust, and trust requires sustained commitment.  This program requires that all participants be ready to fully commit themselves to the program.</p></description>

    <description><p>This ten-week program is designed to give students an intensive interdisciplinary introduction to critical and creative reading and writing, on the one hand, and scientific fieldwork and forest ecology, on the other.  Our curriculum aims to identify parallels between the sciences and the humanities on behalf of articulating transdisciplinary theories and practices that are adequate to the urgent scientific, ethical, and political questions that confront our cultural moment. </p><p>We will explore how observation and analysis are vital to both the sciences and the humanities and, will apply these skills across a variety of fields. We will read from a wide range of authors and genres from a wide range of time periods, and we will experiment both with writing styles and with lab equipment. We will conduct long-term ecological monitoring and embrace revision in our compositions. Our 1000-acre campus forest and our 750,000-book library will be the primary fieldsites of our interdisciplinary inquiry. Call these branches of our investigation “forest space” and “book space.”</p><p>We will ask, and try to answer, tough questions that challenge how we view the world. What needs to be the case for things to be otherwise? This question, in particular, will allow us to address the fact and possibility of change --- of transformation and metamorphosis --- in both the human and the natural worlds, and perhaps also to understand some of the ways in which our understandings of nature and culture have come into being in the first place. What is the relationship between evolution and revolution, between photosynthesis and rhetoric? How do patterns influence processes? How can we identify, define, describe, observe, and analyze the objects of our inquiry—whether that be a 14-line sonnet on the page of a book, or a meter-squared quadrat in the forest?</p><p>This program will give you the chance to stretch your creative, analytical, logical, and critical muscles while preparing you for a successful journey through Evergreen. No experience necessary, some assembly required, all students welcome. We proceed on the premise that there’s no such thing as bad weather, only bad gear. So come prepared to write and to perambulate outdoors, and bring a good notebook and a good writing utensil, a good pair of boots and good raingear. The only way to do this right is by writing, and going for some long walks in the woods.</p><p><strong>This program will be repeated in winter and spring quarters. Students who take this program in fall should not register for the winter or spring quarter repeat.</strong></p></description>

    <description><p>Are destructive emotions innately embedded in human nature?  Can they be eradicated?  A growing body of Western research has examined these and other questions through the perspectives of Eastern psychology and philosophy which view destructive emotions, perceptions, and behaviors as the primary source of human suffering.  To alleviate this suffering, Eastern psychology has developed a rich and varied methodology for recognizing, reducing, transforming, and preventing these destructive forms of mind and emotion.  After examining the nature and function of the afflictive mind/emotions, students will choose one emotion to study in-depth and develop effective East/West interventions to transform this emotion/state of mind.</p></description>

    <title>American Crime and Punishment: Exploring Incarceration and Its Human Consequences</title>
    <minimum_credits>16</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>16</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>Today, the United States incarcerates more people -- both in raw numbers and per capita -- than any other nation on the planet.  How have we arrived at this place in the world and where do we go from here?</p><p>This program will examine the history, the present, and the future of criminal imprisonment in the U.S. We will study the formal institutions driving incarceration policies over the course of American history and we will look at who are the people behind the bars, their families, their communities, and what are public attitudes towards them.</p><p>Students will learn about the U.S. legal system, from the trial courts in our own communities to the appellate court decisions that establish the framework for the criminal law. We will study the evolution of the U.S. criminal justice system and its roots in the political and economic forces affecting our nation throughout its history. We will consider particular historical touchstones that still echo in our prisons and courts today, including the Jim Crow laws of the post-Reconstruction South, the origins of the War on Drugs, the Red Scares of the early and mid-20th century, and post-9/11 law enforcement. We will also explore creative alternatives to crime and punishment and the economic and political obstacles to reforming the criminal law.</p><p>Our work will include learning how to read and understand relevant Supreme Court precedent and how to do basic legal research to better understand these cases. We will also study and critique existing statutory laws that affect the rights of defendants.</p><p>We will complement this theoretical understanding with the voices of prisoners themselves, reading literature, essays and poetry written about and by the men and women who have been imprisoned, or even executed, by the state. Students will read prison writers and poets such as Eugene Debs, Eldridge Cleaver, Etheridge Knight, Jimmy Santiago Baca, Troy Davis, and Mumia Abu-Jamal, as well as writers like James Baldwin, who wrote eloquently on behalf of the incarcerated. We will explore the importance of storytelling in legal advocacy for the accused and convicted and in related social change movements.</p><p>During the quarter, students will build skills in critical reading, writing, and collaboration, as well as independent self-directed research. We hope to spend time in the community observing the actual practice of the criminal justice system by visiting trial courts and the Washington State Supreme Court. Program content will also include film and video, in-class speakers, and meeting with community groups working towards criminal justice reform.</p><p><strong>This program will be repeated in winter quarter. Students who take this program in fall should not register for the winter quarter repeat.</strong></p></description>

    <description><p>Teacher candidates in the Master in Teaching program benefit from two full-time, 10-week, student teaching experiences. Consistent with our goals for graduate-level teacher preparation, the winter quarter is provided between the two student teaching assignments for personal reflection, continued growth in classroom teaching knowledge and skills, attention to professional activities and development of a professional growth plan.</p><p>Having two internship placements at different grade levels and in different schools provides teaching experiences in subject endorsement area/s with a variety of public school students. Candidates are placed in classrooms where cooperating mentor teachers have been identified by school districts as appropriate mentors for our teacher candidates. One student teaching placement is in a diverse, urban setting.</p><p>The first experience begins in late August or early September in accordance with the public school calendar. This model is based on research indicating that having a student teaching experience in the opening weeks of the school year contributes positively to the success of a first-year teacher.</p><p>The second assignment begins in early spring and continues toward the end of the academic year. With this second opportunity, candidates: (a) enhance their teaching practices, (b) gain an understanding of how teachers organize the curriculum in the closing months of the school year (c) make comparisons between different school settings and grade levels and (d) demonstrate ability to gain entry and get to know the assets in new communities.</p><p>The narrative evaluation of student teaching performance is based on the Evergreen faculty supervisor’s observations in combination with the assessment of the cooperating mentor teacher. We use Danielson’s model for assessment (adapted for pre-service teacher education), which is one of the 3 assessment models used in Washington State for continuing teachers. As required by the state of Washington, candidates must demonstrate a positive impact on student learning. They must also pass a state-required Teacher Performance Assessment (edTPA) administered and evaluated by Pearson to be recommended for certification.</p></description>

    <description><p>Rigorous quantitative and qualitative research is an important component of academic learning in Environmental Studies. This independent learning opportunity is designed to allow advanced students to delve into real-world research with faculty who are currently engaged in specific projects. The program will help students develop vital skills in research design, data acquisition and interpretation, written and oral communication, collaboration, and critical thinking skills—all of which are of particular value for students who are pursuing a graduate degree, as well as for graduates who are already in the job market.</p><p><b>Pauline Yu</b>
      (marine science) studies the developmental physiology and ecology of marine invertebrates. She is interested in the biochemistry of the seawater-organism interface, developmental nutritional biochemistry and metabolic depression, invasive species, carbonate chemistry (ocean acidification), and cultural relationships with foods from the sea. Students have the opportunity to collaboratively develop lines of inquiry for lab and/or field studies in ecology, developmental biology, physiology, marine carbonate chemistry and mariculture.

    <description><p>Advanced Research Methods (ARM) is a required course for the MPA&apos;s Public Policy Concentration, and is open as an elective for other MPA students. In order to take this course, students must have completed the MPA first year Core program and either be enrolled in, or completed, the MPA second year Core program. Advanced undergraduate students can apply for instructor permission to enroll on a space available basis.</p><p>Advanced Research Methods examines advanced and multivariate statistical methods from a practical viewpoint using SPSS and Microsoft Excel. Our aim is to introduce students to a variety of statistical research techniques as well as enhance their ability to read and interpret research findings.  </p><p>Though this course takes place over of two intensive weekends, the learning will not be hurried. Our focus will be on becoming better users and readers of research and workplace data. Our task – and it is an important task – is to learn how to analyze data sensibly and in context to enhance decision-making and organizational performance.</p></description>

    <title>Foundations of Public Policy</title>
    <minimum_credits>4</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>4</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>“Public Policy” is the sexy alter ego of public administration. The study of policymaking tantalizes us. It suggests that if we can unlock the secrets to how and when big policy decisions are made, and have an impact on those decisions, we can also benefit groups and causes we care about. The reality is more nuanced. The models describing the policy process don’t provide any magic buttons to push, but they do provide a variety of helpful frames for making sense of a complex reality. And despite the advent of “fact-free” campaigning, the study of policy analysis and mastery of policy analysis skills remain critical to effective governance.</p></description>

    <maximum_credits>4</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>Advanced GIS is a fast-paced course designed to teach graduate students to use Geographic Information Systems (GIS) for mapping, spatial data management, and spatial data analysis. Instruction is based on reading assignments, lectures, and weekly hands-on labs using ArcGIS 10.1, including both desktop and online mapping tools for collaboration and presentation. </p><p>
      Evaluations are based on the quality of student-produced map and analysis products and two quizzes. Students should have experience with quantitative software and must be able to demonstrate a solid understanding of MS Windows file management practices. Students will be expected to use the Esri software suite outside of class, for performing hands-on mapping assignments.  Student versions of the ArcGIS software will be made available, but support is limited to college computers (note: ArcGIS Desktop software runs only under MS Windows, see requirements:
      <a href="http://resources.arcgis.com/en/help/system-requirements/10.1/"><strong>http://resources.arcgis.com/en/help/system-requirements/10.1</strong></a>
      ).

    <title>Design Thinking for Public Service 2-Credit</title>
    <minimum_credits>2</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>2</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>In this course, we apply a design thinking perspective to contemporary administrative, social, and physical problems and challenges. Design thinking brings together people from different disciplines to effectively explore, in collaboration, human-centered approaches to contemporary challenges. While we&apos;ll study the theory of design thinking, the main focus of this course is on the application of design thinking in communities and administration. We will examine both design as a physical element to create/make/sustain communities as well as design as a method for social innovation, service delivery, and management. We&apos;ll study design thinking, cases of social and communal innovation using design thinking, and work together to apply design thinking to real-world situations. Our learning laboratory is the City of Tenino. This course is applicable for students interested in social and administrative innovation, city planning, and community building.</p><p>Use this CRN to register for 2-credit option:  10334</p></description>

    <title>Elections and the Economy</title>
    <minimum_credits>16</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>16</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>Are you interested in the future of our economy?  Do you want to find out how public policy relates to economics? This November, voters will be called upon to make choices about future leadership and public policy at all levels of government. Topics that have been raised and will continue to be discussed through the elections - and that may guide the policies of successful candidates - include wages and incomes, inequality, budget and trade deficits, financial sector oversight, among others. All these topics are fundamentally related to the economy, particularly to macroeconomics, and yet the analysis of candidates&apos; economic positions receives less public attention than it merits.</p><p>This program will equip students to better understand and assess candidates’ economic positions. Looking closely at national and state campaigns and their aftermath, students will analyze the positions of candidates from the perspective of economics and develop the tools to carefully examine candidates’ positions. We will also gain an historical perspective by devoting attention to several candidates and their positions on the economy from the 19th and 20th centuries. Students will learn the methods and the data that support this kind of work. </p><p>Students will demonstrate their learning in a number of ways, including mock video campaign ads that capture candidates’ perspectives on the economy and papers analyzing candidates’ economic positions taken from the content of their websites or campaign presentations. Following the election, we will explore the results to determine the impact of the economic issues on the outcome. Students will prepare a research paper on this subject focusing on a demographic group – state, gender, ethnicity, urban/rural – to determine what economic factors, if any, may have influenced their voting patterns.</p></description>

    <title>Environmental Advocacy</title>
    <minimum_credits>4</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>4</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>Prevention and resolution of environmental problems depends significantly on effective environmental advocacy.  Science, government regulation, and market mechanisms are insufficient without it.  The purpose of this elective is to learn and practice skills needed to be an effective environmental advocate, including analysis of a contested policy situation, development of an effective strategy to affect its outcome, and methods for implementing the strategy through organized, collective action.  This knowledge is useful for those working within government, the private sector, environmental advocacy groups, and as citizen activists.  We will study cases that illustrate the successes and failures of various attempts to influence events, including guest lectures by participants in those cases.  We will learn to practically apply social science theoretical frameworks in ways that help create effective strategy.  The course provides a critical survey of approaches to environmental advocacy – from global to local – emphasizing strengths and weaknesses.  Students will research, write and present on a case of their choosing, preferably from their own experience, that illustrates the principles we study.  After taking the course, students should have improved abilities to diagram the sequence of events leading to an environmental policy decision, locate decision points and key players, find pivotal opportunities for intervention, assemble coalitions capable of effecting change, and act ethically and appropriately to carry out strategy from within their role in the public or private sector.</p><p class="MsoNormal"><strong>Faculty Biography:</strong></p><p><em>Ted Whitesell, Ph.D.</em>, is a broadly trained cultural geographer with special interests in political ecology and conservation.  As a freshman at the University of Colorado, Ted co-founded the CU Wilderness Study Group. After graduation, Ted ran the Colorado Wilderness Workshop, the only statewide preservation organization at the time. From 1975 to 1985, he was a leader of the Southeast Alaska Conservation Council, campaigning to secure designation of the first wilderness areas in the Tongass National Forest. He was recognized as the most accomplished environmental leader in the country of 25 years of age or less by the Tyler Foundation.  Later, he earned a Ph.D. in geography from the University of California, Berkeley, investigating grassroots proposals for conservation and development in the Amazon rainforest of Brazil. Ted came to The Evergreen State College in 1998 and is affiliated with two planning units – Environmental Studies and Sustainability &amp; Justice.  His students published a major book in April 2004, called <em>Defending Wild Washington</em> (The Mountaineers Books). His most recent research was a collaborative investigation of tribal perspectives on marine protected areas in western Washington.</p><p> </p></description>

    <minimum_credits>4</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>4</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>This year-long sequence of courses covers the first year of Spanish. </p><p>Have you wanted to learn Spanish so you can communicate face-to-face when you take that long-dreamed of trip to the sunny beaches of Mexico, Central or South America?   Have you noticed that you hear more Spanish being spoken in the various community locations you frequent such as grocery, hardware and department stores?   Are you curious about the culture of the people that now constitute the largest ethnic minority in the United States?  Have you come to the conclusion that being able to communicate in Spanish would greatly increase your professional or academic flexibility and value?  Did you study Spanish previously and want to “brush up” on your skills? Any and all of these are excellent reasons to study Spanish, and one of the Spanish classes offered at Evergreen will meet your needs.</p><p>You may need to start with Beginning Spanish I  if you have little or no experience with learning the language or if your previous experience with studying the language was some years ago.  </p><p>Classes are highly interactive, safe environments to practice your new skills.   A wide range of learning activities is provided so that students learn to read, write, speak and understand the language.   Students use a written text and workbook for self-study.   An online learning vehicle is also used so that students are immersed in the various components of the language.   Students have access to a language lab that incorporates Rosetta Stone for additional practice.   Cultural activities are integrated into the classes so that students learn not only the language but also the major cultural values and traditions of countries where Spanish is spoken.   A culminating language fair is held during spring quarter in conjunction with other language classes and provides language students with opportunities to display their own learning as well as learn about the other cultures represented by those languages.   Come join us and begin expanding your world – present and future!</p><p>The following is a short description of the material covered in each of the Beginning Spanish classes:</p><p>
      Beginning Spanish I: Beginning Spanish I students acquire the skills to understand written and oral language and to express themselves in written and oral language about the following: greetings, introductions, expressions of courtesy, academic life, days of the week, schedules, family, identifying and describing people, professions and occupations, leisure activities, sports, asking for and giving directions within a city or campus, travel and vacation arrangements and activities, months and seasons of the year and weather.    Students acquire the following grammatical structures: use of the verbs
      <em>hay</em>
      and
      <em>gustar</em>
      , conjugation of verbs in the present tense including stem-changing verbs,
      <em>ser</em>
      and
      <em>estar</em>
      , noun/adjective agreement, subject/verb agreement, and various idiomatic expressions related to the topics studied.
    </p><p>
      Beginning Spanish II: Beginning Spanish II students acquire the skills to understand written and oral language and to express themselves in written and oral language about the following: vacations and other free time activities, months of the year, seasons and weather, clothing and shopping, negotiating a price and buying, colors, daily routines and time expressions, food and meals.   Students acquire the following grammatical structures: use of the reflexive mood and preterit tense, including verbs
      <em>ser</em>
      and
      <em>ir</em>
      in the preterit, demonstrative pronouns, direct and indirect object pronouns, and various idiomatic expressions related to the topics studied.
    </p><p>Beginning Spanish III: Beginning Spanish III students continue to build their knowledge base of the foundational communicative structures, including: use of reflexive verbs, indefinite and negative words, preterite of irregular and stem-changing verbs, double object pronouns, the imperfect tense, contrasting uses and meanings of preterite and imperfect tenses, familiar and formal commands, and the present subjunctive.   These structures are acquired while communicating about the following: describing one’s daily personal hygiene and life routines, shopping for and describing food and preparing meals, parties and celebrations, family relationships and stages of life, identifying parts of the body and symptoms and medical conditions to obtain medical assistance and daily domestic chores and routines.</p></description>

    <title>Enduring Stories (at Grays Harbor)</title>
    <minimum_credits>4</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>4</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>Our stories are expressions of our values, our identity, our culture, and our history, and they help us make meaning of our experiences. We communicate our stories not only through words, but also through cultural practices and traditions - music, dance and craft, how we grow and prepare food, our celebrations and rituals. Using this broad conceptualization of story, students will explore the purpose and value of story in family, community, cultural and occupational life in the Harbor and outlying region. We will consider what stories and cultural practices shape the dominate narrative, what stories are left out, and who decides which stories we hear. Students will also consider how the process of constructing narratives impacts our individual and collective behavior. Students connect theory with practice by conducting fieldwork that documents and interprets a tradition or cultural practice in their own lives. The project will help students locate their own story within the local, regional, and national narratives. </p></description>

    <description><p>In this world of information explosion, we are constantly bombarded by numbers. How do you make sense of those numbers? How can you tell which are used correctly and which are not? How can we use statistical tools to inform, to explore and to empower? What are the larger frameworks behind those numbers? How do we use quantitative reasoning to enhance our understanding of the society and make changes? This class will put statistics into context. We will cover basic statistical concepts and processes used in social sciences including descriptive and inferential statistics. Focus will be placed on real life scenarios and sense making practices. Besides workshops, students will conduct a research project and practice statistical analysis. This course meets the statistics prerequisite requirements of the Evergreen Master of Public Administration (MPA) program.</p></description>

    <description><p>Public Finance Policy will review finance and fiscal policy challenges facing federal, state, and local governments. We will examine issues central to public expenditure programs, and taxation policies. Students will seek practical solutions to planning, implementation, and reporting problems in public finance. The course will discuss budgetary formation, deliberation, adoption, implementation and execution. Further, each aspect of finance policy will be examined in order to understand the process, functions, and history of public budgeting reform. The course will discuss revenue policy, the spending of public resources, dynamics of changing budget processes, and issues associated with balancing budgets. Students –  in the role of citizens, administrators, and public officials –  shall engage public finance policy issues of concern to them in pursuit of fairness.</p></description>

    <description><p>
      In its first words on the subject of citizenship, Congress in 1790 restricted naturalization to ‘white persons.’   [T]his racial prerequisite to citizenship endured for over a century and a half, remaining in force until 1952.   From the earliest years of this country until just a generation ago, being a &quot;white person&quot; was a condition for acquiring citizenship.” -- Ian Haney Lopez,
      <em>White By Law</em>
      , 1.
    </p><p class="style8">Most people do not realize that the notion of the United States as a “white” majority nation is largely a construction of law, and that people of many different nationalities who were deemed “not white” for purposes of immigration became “white” over the course of U.S. social and legal history.  The current legal regime that imposes severe criminal penalties for violations of immigration law provisions is a recent development in U.S. law, and constitutes a dramatic change in the legal approach to immigration and immigrants from the Western Hemisphere, especially Mexico.   </p><p class="style8">Within the context of the impending presidential election, we&apos;ll study the major legal and historical events that have shaped and continue to structure the debates over immigration. We’ll examine the current landscape of immigration law and policy as well as restrictionist and immigrant-rights movements.  We’ll critically analyze how concepts of race are embedded in immigration law and policy and how those embedded concepts shape the laws and their operation today. We will examine current controversies about immigration, immigrant workers, labor movements, and the varied ways communities respond to the most recent immigration boom.</p><p>Students will build some basic legal skills through reading and researching important cases and laws.   </p></description>

    <minimum_credits>4</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>4</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>This course focuses on the biology that underlies conservation and restoration issues around the world. There are many ways to approach the study of conservation and restoration biology and this course will mostly emphasize the scientific elements of these disciplines. The course will also will provide you with a practitioner&apos;s perspective of the relationship of biology and policy from work done in Washington State. This course will introduce you to the literature, controversies, and promising methodologies for a variety of conservation/restoration biology applications. In addition, a number of local experts will come in and provide perspectives on their work in applied fields of conservation. We will read, discuss, and write on a variety of topics. Your assignments include written and oral exercises, and peer evaluations aimed at helping you develop your ideas and increase your ability to communicate those ideas. This course will introduce you to the principal concepts and methodologies of conservation and restoration biology, enrich your understanding of the scientific contributions necessary for solving conservation problems, foster your understanding of the scientific process in general and as applied in conservation settings, and further your powers of analysis and ability to communicate effectively.</p><p><strong>Faculty Biography</strong><br/><em>Timothy Quinn, Ph.D.</em>, has served as chief scientist of the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife’s habitat program since 1999.

    <maximum_credits>4</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>It is widely agreed that an environmentally literate and concerned citizenry is crucial to environmental quality and long-term sustainability--but how and where is environmental and sustainability literacy fostered? And where &quot;environmental education&quot; occurs, is it effective?  This class explores the history, philosophical underpinnings, and current trends in environmental education for both youth and adults, in both formal sectors (schools and colleges) and non-formal ones. This class provides a theoretical and practical introduction to the field of environmental education and interpretation. It will be useful to students interested in environmental teaching or communications as a career, or to those whose environmental work might involve education or outreach components. Note: A one-day Saturday field trip will be taken to Northwest Trek Wildlife Park in Eatonville, Washington; students should expect to pay a nominal entrance fee.</p><p><b>Course Outcomes:</b></p><ul><li>A theoretical grounding in environmental education (EE): its precursor fields and their various rationales, and the working principles to which EE professionals aspire. </li><li>An introductory understanding of learning theory and of the types of educational settings that foster meaningful, lasting learning.</li><li>A working knowledge of several arenas in which environmental education is practiced, with attention to both the opportunities and challenges for volunteer and professional environmental educators.</li><li>A framework for evaluation of environmental education programs.</li><li>An understanding of the increasingly politically charged nature of environmental education and implications for professional practice.</li><li>The student&apos;s own construction of the promise of environmental education as well as some of its shortcomings and tensions----and a more complex &quot;concept map&quot; of the field.</li><li>An introductory understanding of social marketing approaches to fostering environmentally responsible behaviors.</li><li>A heightened awareness of environmental literacy as a global imperative.  </li></ul><p><strong>Faculty Biography:</strong></p><p><em>Jean MacGregor, M.S.,</em> is a Senior Scholar at the Washington Center for Improving the Quality of Undergraduate Education at The Evergreen State College. She directs the Curriculum for the Bioregion Initiative, a faculty and curriculum development initiative, whose mission is to prepare undergraduates to live in a world where the complex issues of environmental quality, community health and wellbeing, environmental justice, and sustainability are paramount.  The Curriculum for the Bioregion initiative involves hundreds of faculty members at colleges and universities throughout Washington State. Prior to work at Evergreen, she helped develop the environmental studies program at Warren Wilson College near Asheville, North Carolina.  Earlier in her career, she developed and/or evaluated environmental education programs for both youth and adults at nature centers and science museums, and in various outdoor and wilderness learning settings.</p></description>

    <title>Introduction to GIS</title>
    <minimum_credits>4</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>4</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>
      This course will teach students how to use the versatile technology of Geographic Information Systems (GIS).  GIS is more than map-making.  A GIS integrates computer hardware, software, and data for capturing, managing, analyzing, and displaying all forms of geographically referenced information across a wide variety of disciplines. GIS technology is increasingly used by physical and social scientists, policy makers, businesses, environmental and conservation organizations, utilities, public health providers, the military, and educators, to name a few.  More and more organizations are using spatial data and analysis to help them make decisions relating to acceptable land uses, allocation of resources and assets, fairness and social wellbeing, and many other needs. Instruction will rely strongly on weekly hands-on labs and homework exercises to guide students through a public policy decision process from beginning to end over the duration of the quarter.  Students will learn to manage spatial data and tools, mainly using the
      <a href="http://www.esri.com">Esri suite of software</a>
      commonly known as ArcGIS. No previous experience with GIS is required.  Student versions of the ArcGIS software suite will be made available for home use (but technical support is limited to college computers).
    </p><p><strong>Faculty Biography</strong><br/><em>Michael Ruth, M.Sc.,</em>
      is a professional GIS practitioner for Esri (Environmental Systems Research Institute, Inc).  Mike has been a project manager and consultant for Esri, helping a wide variety of agencies learn and exploit geographic information systems.  His clients have included major non governmental organizations, tribal and state governments, and US federal agencies.  Mike studied Environmental Science in college, later specializing in Geology at George Washington University.  For his Masters degree, Mike completing a field mapping project studying the geology of the western Dominican Republic along the Haiti border area.  After completing his Master of Science degree, Mike worked for the Spot Image Corporation, developing GeoTIFF and other satellite imagery methods for GIS integration.  Now at Esri, Mike has focused on Africa projects for non-profit organizations over the past few years.  Recent projects address the applications of GIS technology for improving polio vaccination success in Nigeria, agricultural improvement for small holder farmers in Tanzania, and participatory community conservation activities in the western Serengeti, among other projects.

Saul, M.A., M.E.S.,</em> received her BA in French and BS in Chemical Engineering from the University of Notre Dame and MA in Management from the Wharton School of Business (University of Pennsylvania) before turning her attention to environmental issues and eventually joining the MES program at Evergreen.  After completing her degree in 2009, she taught Statistics in the Evening and Weekend studies program and Qualitative Methods, an Energy elective and gCORE in the Graduate Program on the Environment. Kathleen then moved to the Center for Energy and Environmental Policy at the University of Delaware to pursue her PhD. Her dissertation research focuses on the displacement of people that results from large scale technology projects, with a focus those involving nuclear technology.  While at Delaware, she participated in research projects looking into the energy policy implications of the Fukushima nuclear disaster as well as alternative administrative forms for organizations devoted to energy conservation, efficiency, and sustainable energy options. She also taught in the undergraduate Introduction to Energy Policy and Sustainable Energy Policy and Planning courses.  Her engineering acumen, business sense, and environmental awareness all come together in understanding modern energy systems and the green energy economy.</p></description>

    <title>Learning Across Differences: Collaborations in Conservation and Sustainability in Prisons</title>
    <minimum_credits>4</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>4</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>This class will explore provocative, intersectional topics including restorative, social, and environmental justice, ecotherapy, mass incarceration, ecological restoration, Just Sustainability, institutional operations, institutional racism, prison abolition, transformative and punitive rehabilitation, and returning citizens’ experiences of reintegration. The Sustainability in Prisons Project (SPP) will serve as the case study. The SPP partnership supports more than 100 science, sustainability, and education programs statewide. Referencing SPP, we will consider limitations and opportunities for social, economic, and environmental sustainability in prisons. Diverse guest speakers will contribute critiques and potential innovations. Students will be challenged to think holistically and propose realistic solutions which would benefit incarcerated individuals, returning citizens, and communities.</p></description>

    <title>Poverty: What, Why, and How (at Grays Harbor)</title>
    <minimum_credits>4</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>4</maximum_credits>
    <description><p><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">Many of us have seen the ugly face of poverty. But what is poverty? Why is poverty so prevalent? Who are the poor? What are the underlying causes of poverty? Why is poverty a disease of the whole society (not just the poor)? How is poverty manifested in people’s everyday life? Why are certain racial and ethnic groups more likely to fall into poverty? How do economic processes contribute to poverty? What are the goals and purposes of social welfare programs? What are the limits of policy? How can we act as a community to eliminate poverty?</span></p><p>This course will explore poverty in the larger social context of increasing social inequality and use sociological theories to investigate various aspects of poverty and its particularities in the U.S.</p><p>Using poverty as our subject of inquiry, we will study sociological theories and key concepts and critically examine their applicability in class and poverty related issues. We will explore the intricate and complex relationship between social structure and individuals. Course activities will include lectures, seminar, and workshop, individual and group projects. Students will write seminar essays, self-reflection papers, and carry out a mini research project oriented toward action.</p><p>
      This course is complementary to
      <em>Community Connections: What Makes Communities Work.</em>
      It can also be taken as a separate course.

    <title>On Reading Well</title>
    <minimum_credits>4</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>4</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>
      This course will help students to develop clearer and more comprehensive understandings of literary texts, as well as to forge a more rewarding relationship with reading in general. In a supportive group environment, students will explore a range of reading strategies, including textual analysis, background research, response and summary writing, and recitation. Then they will apply these tools to an in-depth study of several works of nineteenth- and twentieth-century literature
      <em>.</em>
      Our overall goal is to become more resourceful, effective, and insightful readers.
    </p><p>
      Our winter texts will include Charlotte Bronte&apos;s
      <i>Jane Eyre</i>
      , Ray Bradbury&apos;s
      <i>Fahrenheit 451</i>
      , and Muriel Spark&apos;s
      <i>The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie</i>
      .

    <description><p>What does success look like? In this course we will endeavor to respond to this question on both personal and professional levels. It takes integrated thinking and discipline to become a successful project manager. Tools are only tools. In addition to building an awareness of your own management style, we will use real world client based applications to explore and understand the nuances of successful project management. Students will work hands on with a pre-selected client organization to apply their learning and develop a viable project management plan.</p></description>

    <maximum_credits>16</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>
      This full time one-quarter program will offer an intensive introduction to the concepts and methods of college-level general chemistry, providing the equivalent of a yearlong course in general chemistry. It will use an organizing theme that is based on the cycles and transformations of matter and energy at a variety of scales in both living and nonliving systems. Use of quantitative methods will be emphasized in all areas of the program, providing additional insights into these processes. Students will undertake assignments focused on interpreting and integrating all of the topics covered. The work will emphasize critical thinking and quantitative reasoning, as well as the development of proficient writing and speaking skills.
      <br/><br/>
      Program activities will include lectures, small-group problem-solving workshops, and laboratory work. Students can expect to spend several hours a day in lab each week, maintain laboratory notebooks, write formal laboratory reports and give formal presentations of their work. Group work will also include reading and discussion of topics of current or historical significance in chemistry. This will be a rigorous program, requiring a serious commitment of time and effort on the part of the student. Overall, it is expected that students will end the program with the ability to reason critically, solve problems and have hands-on experience with general chemistry.
      <br/><br/>
      This program will give students the chemistry prerequisite needed to pursue upper division work in chemistry, biochemistry and environmental science.

    <title>European Ethnobotany and Art</title>
    <minimum_credits>16</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>16</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>Students in this program will learn about medieval and early modern European botany and northern Renaissance art in a historical and cultural context, with some limited hands-on learning in herbology. Our study will include European herbals with an emphasis on the period between the 15th and 18th centuries, which was an important period in the history of western botany. We will explore how the rise of the market economy and scientific revolution influenced the rise of botany as a profession. The growing interest in plants, science and medicine at this time goes hand-in-hand with the development of the art as it moves toward a focus on nature and humanity in landscape painting and secular portraits and away from a single-minded attention on religion. However, spirituality is still a prime motivator of the age. In studying art of the northern Renaissance we will examine exquisite panel paintings, visionary illuminated manuscripts, expressionistic German Renaissance sculpture and the origins of printmaking. During the 16th century this world is shaken by the Reformation and religious wars—leading to the enigmatic, tortured subject matter of Grunewald and Bosch. We will also examine the claim that the witch-hunts constituted a kind of pogrom on women with healing knowledge and midwifery skills. Lectures and readings will cover the history of art, colonial botany, horticulture, medicine, and natural history from 1400 to 1800. In hands-on practicums, students will learn to prepare salves, tinctures, decoctions, and infusions. They will also spend time learning botanical illustration in watercolor and creating their own herbal in the form of a handmade book using the historical and beautiful Coptic Stitch. </p></description>

    <title>Ceramics: An Introduction</title>
    <minimum_credits>4</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>4</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>This course is intended as an overview of ceramic studio practices.  Students will learn a variety of wheel-thrown and hand-built ceramic techniques including slip-casting and sprig mold making.  Thematic projects are designed to aide students toward the development of an informed and personal style while gaining solid foundation skills in both functional and sculptural work. Critical analysis of resulting work will be scheduled through written observations and through group discussions.  Demonstrations will introduce students to clay types, kiln firing methods, glazing and related surfacing techniques.   Presentations on the history and contemporary application of ceramic arts will contextualize studio work. </p></description>

    <title>Counting on the Brain</title>
    <minimum_credits>16</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>16</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>Neuroscience continues to be one of the fastest growing areas of biology and is at the cutting edge of technical and conceptual advances in the life sciences. If you want to know how animals (including humans) touch, hear, see, smell, and remember things, then you need to study ions, molecules, cells, neural networks, brain structure and behavior. We will first learn about the function of the brain’s cellular computers: neurons. We will learn how neurons differ from other cells, how they generate electrical signals, and how they communicate with one another via synapses. We will then investigate how neurons cooperate in circuits by studying five sensory systems: vision, touch, hearing, taste and smell. Cellular and molecular mechanisms will be emphasized alongside the physics and mathematics of neurobiology. In the mathematics workshops we will study linear, exponential, rational, and logarithmic functions using a problem-solving approach to college algebra. Collaborative learning will be emphasized. A graphing calculator is required. Strong emphasis will be placed on developing students&apos; quantitative skills in order that they be prepared to undertake future scientific programs.</p><p>Our learning goals will include development of analytical and critical thinking, quantitative reasoning, reading, and writing skills. Weekly activities will include lectures, presentations, labs, workshops, and seminars. Students will be required to submit weekly homework assignments, lab and workshop reports, and seminar papers and to contribute actively to the learning community. Students who successfully complete the math portion of the program will receive six credits of Algebraic Thinking for Science and be prepared for precalculus I.</p><p><strong>Note: This program will be repeated winter and spring quarters.  Students taking the program fall quarter should not register for the winter or spring repeat.</strong></p></description>

    <description><p>What does it mean to have--and use--a voice on the internet? What can be said about--and done about--new structures of privacy, conversation, and agency in a radically connected society? We&apos;ll develop these questions, discussing current scholarship on society and communication in the internet connected age. And we&apos;ll learn the fundamentals of web development, using HTML and CSS, along with some very basic programming, to visually shape discourse on the web. We&apos;ll emphasize designing for generated content like blogs. We&apos;ll also work on writing for internet messages. The program will emphasize the persistence of communication through adaptation and advocacy.</p></description>

    <title>Health, Power, and Justice: A Native Perspective</title>
    <minimum_credits>16</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>16</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>What are the factors that determine our health? In what ways do race, class, and gender affect the health of individuals and communities? In this introductory program we will explore health and well-being within the contexts of narrative, power, and social justice. We will use an interdisciplinary lens of science and the humanities to question the embodied experiences of sickness and healing. Our focus will be on the linkages between Northwest places and Native American and Indigenous peoples, framing our discussions of health around themes of environmental and economic sustainability, social justice and education, and popular culture. We will question and examine competing public narratives, particularly how the health and wellness of Native people are portrayed in the medical field, museums, case studies, films, and texts. From the biological perspective, we will analyze the physiological and genetic basis for the apparent health disparities in these communities. We will explore scientific articles and texts about the effect of culture-based diets and nutrition on disease and immunity.</p><p>Through program workshops, students will develop a variety of skills, including the scientific method, historical research, quantitative and qualitative analysis of data, policy research and writing, film critique, interviewing, and oral history. Students will use these skills to become stronger writers and researchers, and importantly, community members. We will help students learn to listen and observe attentively, do close and critical reading with challenging texts, contribute clear and well developed writing, make relevant contributions to seminar discussions, and acquire research and laboratory skills in biology, history, and Native American studies. Guest presenters, documentary films, museum exhibits, and two field trips to tribal museums and urban community organizations will support our analysis.</p><p><strong>Note: This program will repeat winter quarter.  Students who take the fall program should not register for the winter repeat.</strong></p></description>

    <title>Economic and Community Development</title>
    <minimum_credits>4</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>4</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>Is community and economic development different or are the objectives similar? This course will provide a foundation of development while comparing and contrasting community and economic development approaches. Additionally, local and global development perspectives will be explored analyzing different economic and community development decisions. The intersection of community and economic development will be framed as well as the desired outcomes of each approach. This course will be split into lecture and discussion for part of the class as well as in class projects and group assignments for the remainder. Attendance is critical to the success of this class and will provide the best learning environment for this conversational exchange of ideas. A final group project will be a culmination of concepts and ideas throughout the semester and this paper and presentation will be completed by analyzing case studies of communities where there is an intersection of economic and community development.</p></description>

    <title>American Crime and Punishment: Exploring Incarceration and Its Human Consequences</title>
    <minimum_credits>16</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>16</maximum_credits>
    <description><p><strong>This program is a repeat of the program in fall quarter.  Students who take the program in fall should not register for the winter quarter program.</strong></p><p>Today, the United States incarcerates more people -- both in raw numbers and per capita -- than any other nation on the planet.  How have we arrived at this place in the world and where do we go from here?</p><p>This program will examine the history, the present, and the future of criminal imprisonment in the U.S. We will study the formal institutions driving incarceration policies over the course of American history and we will look at who are the people behind the bars, their families, their communities, and what are public attitudes towards them.</p><p>Students will learn about the U.S. legal system, from the trial courts in our own communities to the appellate court decisions that establish the framework for the criminal law. We will study the evolution of the U.S. criminal justice system and its roots in the political and economic forces affecting our nation throughout its history. We will consider particular historical touchstones that still echo in our prisons and courts today, including the Jim Crow laws of the post-Reconstruction South, the origins of the War on Drugs, the Red Scares of the early and mid-20th century, and post-9/11 law enforcement. We will also explore creative alternatives to crime and punishment and the economic and political obstacles to reforming the criminal law.</p><p>Our work will include learning how to read and understand relevant Supreme Court precedent and how to do basic legal research to better understand these cases. We will also study and critique existing statutory laws that affect the rights of defendants.</p><p>We will complement this theoretical understanding with the voices of prisoners themselves, reading literature, essays and poetry written about and by the men and women who have been imprisoned, or even executed, by the state. Students will read prison writers and poets such as Eugene Debs, Eldridge Cleaver, Etheridge Knight, Jimmy Santiago Baca, Troy Davis, and Mumia Abu-Jamal, as well as writers like James Baldwin, who wrote eloquently on behalf of the incarcerated. We will explore the importance of storytelling in legal advocacy for the accused and convicted and in related social change movements.</p><p>During the quarter, students will build skills in critical reading, writing, and collaboration, as well as independent self-directed research. We hope to spend time in the community observing the actual practice of the criminal justice system by visiting trial courts and the Washington State Supreme Court. Program content will also include film and video, in-class speakers, and meeting with community groups working towards criminal justice reform.</p></description>

    <title>Research Capstone in Psychology</title>
    <minimum_credits>16</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>16</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>This program is designed to provide a capstone opportunity within psychology (or closely related social science disciplines such as sociology or cultural anthropology) to conduct independent research projects within a supportive intellectual environment of other researchers. Research projects may be inductive or deductive in their approach, and may utilize qualitative or quantitative methodology. Research may be aimed at testing a well-established theory, replicating a study, crafting an elegant psychological experiment, designing and executing a written survey, conducting interviews, or engaging in observational ethnographic research. </p><p>Students will form research groups within the program based on shared research interests (or methodological interests or theoretical interests). Faculty will provide structured support to these learning communities across all aspects of the research process. Students entering this capstone program should do so with a particular research project in mind, although faculty will work one-on-one with students to help shape the nature of their project in both practical and theoretically meaningful ways.</p><p>Students will attend the annual meeting of the Western Psychological Association (WPA) in Sacramento, CA from April 27-30, 2017. This field trip will provide direct exposure to researchers in psychology, enabling students to talk with other researchers (many of whom are undergraduate or graduate students), find out about the latest trends in research psychology, and be intellectually stimulated by poster sessions, panel presentations, and talks by well-known scholars in the field.</p><p>Students who successfully complete this capstone program will have collected, analyzed, and written up their findings by the end of the spring 2017 quarter. This program is timed to correspond with the November 2017 deadline to apply to present research findings at WPA the following spring 2018 in Portland, OR.</p></description>

    <title>Art, Mindfulness and Psychology: Racial Identity through the Lifespan (8 credit option)</title>
    <minimum_credits>8</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>8</maximum_credits>
    <description><p><strong>
        This 8 credit program is part of the full-time, 16 credit program
        <em>Art, Mindfulness and Psychology: Racial Identity through the Lifespan</em>
        .  For complete program details, including schedule and CRNs, click
        <a href="http://www.evergreen.edu/catalog/2016-17/programs/artmindfulnessandpsychologyracialidentitythroughthelifespan-15553">here</a>
        .
      </strong></p><p>This program will use art, psychology, and mindfulness to explore the intersectionality of race, racial identity and societal health. The practices of mindfulness and creating art can increase our individual and collective resiliency to be able to respond to racial identity issues and structural oppression in adaptive and creative ways.  Mindfulness and the body will be a central focus of the work.  In the studio, we will focus on building skills as well as the expressive qualities of art, to explore non-verbal ways of processing our readings, writings, and discussions about race. The program will integrate mindfulness through theory, practice and its application in relation to developmental psychology, racial identity, and art practice.  Questions to be explored include: How are mindfulness and art making being integrated into working with people at various developmental and racial identity stages of life?  How do systems of racial identity live in the individual, family, and social bodies?  How can the practices of mindfulness and creating art be integral to the healing of racism?</p><p>The program offers 16 and 8 credit options.  All students will explore racial identity through the lifespan by developing skills in mindfulness, drawing and ceramics through intensive studio practice. Students taking 16 credits will also study developmental psychology and related quantitative reasoning skills for social sciences. </p><p>In fall, the program will focus on child and adolescent developmental psychology. In the ceramics lab, students will work though the basic methods of forming in clay and learn essentials for glazing and firing.  Students will also be introduced to basic drawing skills. Constructive critique sessions on key pieces will help students to develop their ideas. In winter, students will focus on adult, geriatric and end of life developmental psychology. Building on the foundational skills and concepts in ceramics and drawing from the fall, students will develop a series of pieces that address the complexity of their own understanding of racial identity.</p><p>Students will have an opportunity to learn using diverse modalities and multiple intelligences.  The program will participate in in depth dialogue, art-making, writing assignments, theoretical tests for developmental psychology studies, and critical study of important texts. This program is designed as a two-quarter program of study preparatory for careers and further study in psychology, fine arts, art therapy, education and cultural studies.</p></description>

    <title>Ireland in History and Memory</title>
    <minimum_credits>16</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>16</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>This two-quarter program explores Ireland and Irish America through the lenses of history, literature, politics, spirituality, the Irish language, film, poetry, and the arts. Fall quarter we begin with Irish ways of understanding the world, focusing on the roots of pre-Christian spirituality and traditional culture. We will examine the blend of pre-Christian and Christian cultures in the first millennium C.E., and move forward to the layered impact of the Vikings, Normans, and English. We end fall quarter with the Celtic Literary Revival (Yeats, Joyce, and others) at the turn of the 20th century. Winter quarter we shift to Irish America for four weeks, then focus our attention on Ireland from the 20th century and into the present.</p><p>Most weeks will include lectures, seminars, small-group work, songs, play-reading out loud, instrumental music practice, poetry, and a film. Short pre-seminar papers will often be required to focus your attention on each week&apos;s texts. In fall quarter three papers are required (on ancient Ireland, the English conquest, and the Celtic Revival). In winter, two larger papers are required (on Irish America and contemporary Ireland). At least one work of visual art—drawing, painting, collage, or sculpture—will be required each quarter (on the Famine and on the Troubles). The last week of fall and winter quarters will focus on collaborative, student-led productions. Students will learn to cook Irish food for a food-and-music gathering once each quarter.</p><p>Every student is expected to work intensively with the Irish-Gaelic language all year—no exceptions. Our work will include frequent lessons and short exams in grammar and pronunciation, as well as application of those lessons to Irish-language songs and poetry. Irish is a challenging language—it requires considerable skills in listening, bravery in speaking, and the ability to accept the existence of very strong regional accents while sorting out the meaning of the individual words and sentences. Similarly, you will be expected to learn to sing and play Irish music on a musical instrument if you cannot already play one. We will practice this music each week. This program is a prerequisite for the spring quarter visit to Ireland.</p><p> </p></description>

    <description><div class="description"><p>Rigorous quantitative and qualitative research is an important component of academic learning in Environmental Studies. This independent learning opportunity is designed to allow advanced students to delve into real-world research with faculty who are currently engaged in specific projects. The program will help students develop vital skills in research design, data acquisition and interpretation, written and oral communication, collaboration, and critical thinking skills—all of which are of particular value for students who are pursuing a graduate degree, as well as for graduates who are already in the job market.</p><p><strong>Lalita Calabria&apos;s research</strong>
        focuses on biodiversity and conservation of bryophytes and lichens in temperate North America. As a broadly trained plant biologist, Lalita uses a multidisciplinary approach to investigating these topics including floristic surveys, ecological studies, herbarium-based research and phytochemical studies of plants. Current activities in her lab focus on assessing the impacts of fire on lichen and bryophyte communities of oak woodlands and prairies, estimating biomass and functional group diversity of bryophyte and lichen ground layers in Puget Sound prairies and quantifying biological nitrogen fixation rates of moss-cyanobacteria symbiosis. Students with backgrounds in botany, ecology, or chemistry could gain skills in bryophyte and lichen identification, as well as, field monitoring methods and studying symbiosis of bryophytes and lichens. Students participating in this program would engage with ongoing research in Lalita’s lab and may have opportunities to develop their own research projects.

    <description><p>This program combines a recent history of the professions in the United States with intensive skills instruction and practice in the areas of professional writing, research, and quantitative reasoning. Through lectures, readings and film, we will explore the rise of the credentialed professions in the U.S. from their origin in the Industrial Revolution to their current status in U.S. society. We will focus primarily on the professions of law, social work and teaching. We will use these examples as case studies in the broader historical development of accredited professional education, the imperatives of licensing and continuing education, and the changing range of socioeconomic standing among the professions in the U.S. over time.</p><p>In this academic context, we will practice and improve college skills fundamental to all the professions, such as English composition and rhetoric, academic and policy research, and the basics of budgeting and financial planning for education and beyond. Students will have the opportunity to initiate new projects in research and writing, or to expand and undergraduate projects already under way. Other opportunities will include new research and classroom presentations about current credentialing education in chosen professions, as well as small group instruction and collaboration on the financial foundations of chosen professions past and present. This program will be research and writing intensive.</p></description>

    <minimum_credits>2</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>2</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>Like never before, the world we face today is increasingly complex, fragmented and uncertain. The political climate is polarizing, and in many places trust in government and our other institutions is eroding. This two-credit course is for both emerging and mature leaders who understand that more and more of our modern challenges are ones that call for a new kind of collective action. Such action requires that we move beyond adversarial agendas and into new kinds of consultative process and engagement strategies that bring out the best in our organizations and communities and foster true collaboration. The intent of this course is to help you to create resilient teams, organizations and communities and to support the development of people around you. Foundational elements of this course will include a look at different leadership styles and approaches, systems dynamics and complexity theory, and a host of participative process methodologies and principles.</p><p> </p></description>

    <title>Gender and Science: An Introduction</title>
    <minimum_credits>16</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>16</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>How do knowledge, power, language and gender interact? How has that interrelationship generated the very idea of gender and gender difference? How does our human understanding of the universe relate to ideas such as universality and objectivity? This introductory program explores and interrogates the gendered production of knowledge and its close relationship to power, human culture and the idea of nature.</p><p>The history of women’s intellectual production and thought has long been silenced or suppressed by patriarchal structures, and to a great extent continues today through institutionalized sexism, androcentrism, and heteronormativity. This fraught history will be unpacked, attendant with the celebration of women&apos;s and othered genders&apos; contributions to scientific knowledge. This program will provide an opportunity for lower division students to gain exposure to the interaction of the natural sciences and social sciences, the societal imprint on science about gender, traditional and critical perspectives on biology and the achievements of women with science. Students who wish to study further in science, science history, gender studies and/or critical theory will obtain a broad foundational overview in this program.</p><p>We will read feminist philosophy of science, sociological studies on science, work by and research on women scientists. We will conduct workshops to confront issues of gender socialization as it relates to quantitative reasoning. Topics to be examined through feminist lenses and laboratory investigations may encompass ecology, developmental biology, genetics, fertilization, reproduction, sex determination, sexuality, and gendered social norms. Books by Rachel Carson, Marlene Zuk and Cordelia Fine will be featured alongside work by Sandra Harding, Donna Haraway, and Patricia Hill Collins. Writing exercises, essays, in-class workshop and lab activities, and lab notebook observations will be emphasized.</p></description>

    <description><p><strong>Note: This program is a repeat of a program offered fall quarter.  Students who took the fall program should not register for the winter repeat.</strong></p><p>What are the factors that determine our health? In what ways do race, class, and gender affect the health of individuals and communities? In this introductory program we will explore health and well-being within the contexts of narrative, power, and social justice. We will use an interdisciplinary lens of science and the humanities to question the embodied experiences of sickness and healing. Our focus will be on the linkages between Northwest places and Native American and Indigenous peoples, framing our discussions of health around themes of environmental and economic sustainability, social justice and education, and popular culture. We will question and examine competing public narratives, particularly how the health and wellness of Native people are portrayed in the medical field, museums, case studies, films, and texts. From the biological perspective, we will analyze the physiological and genetic basis for the apparent health disparities in these communities. We will explore scientific articles and texts about the effect of culture-based diets and nutrition on disease and immunity.</p><p>Through program workshops, students will develop a variety of skills, including the scientific method, historical research, quantitative and qualitative analysis of data, policy research and writing, film critique, interviewing, and oral history. Students will use these skills to become stronger writers and researchers, and importantly, community members. We will help students learn to listen and observe attentively, do close and critical reading with challenging texts, contribute clear and well developed writing, make relevant contributions to seminar discussions, and acquire research and laboratory skills in biology, history, and Native American studies. Guest presenters, documentary films, museum exhibits, and two field trips to tribal museums and urban community organizations will support our analysis.</p></description>

    <title>Science Policy to Action</title>
    <minimum_credits>2</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>2</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>Imagine sitting at “the table,” negotiating science policy with international leaders. Or, researching and drafting a new invasive species law at the governor’s request. This course provides an introduction to science policy, with the goal of translating concepts into implementable action. We will study the actors in the science policy arena; analyze how the United States and international political institutions and processes govern science policy; and experience the roles of scientists and policymakers in creating and implementing policies through case studies covering a wide range of policy areas (e.g., water, health, climate, energy, environment). We also will explore how agencies, legislatures, and courts resolve resource-use conflicts, and the role of scientific information and uncertainty in this process. Background readings and in-class case studies focused on reaching a policy objective will prepare students for authoring a policy memo, and applying these skills to professional experiences. Science policy will come alive!</p></description>

    <title>Ireland in History and Memory: Study Abroad in Ireland</title>
    <minimum_credits>16</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>16</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>This spring quarter program allows up to 25 students to travel to Ireland for at least six weeks of study abroad. The first two weeks will include independent research; after that, we will meet in Gleann Cholm Cille in County Donegal for four weeks of intensive hands-on learning. Students will improve their language skills, learn traditional skills (singing, dancing, poetry writing, drumming, tin whistle playing, weaving, knitting) and explore the region, which is rich in archaeological features such as standing stones and dolmens. Upon their return at the end of May 2017, students will write a significant (20-page) integrative essay, combining the theory of Irish Studies, which they developed during fall and winter, with what they have learned in the practice of living and studying in Ireland. The prerequisite for this program is the successful completion of the Ireland in History and Memory program during fall and winter.</p></description>

                   We will travel to Gleann Cholm Cille in County Donegal, Republic of Ireland which will cost approximately $4,000 per student, including airfare. We will live in shared housing in a small Irish-speaking village next to a beach and surrounded by archaeological wonders that predate the Egyptian pyramids. We will experience daily (and nightly) classes in the Irish language, poetry writing, visual art, weaving, knitting, dancing, singing, archaeology, herbology, politics, and spirituality. We will also make short visits by bus to Northern Ireland and to several major local archaeological sites. Students must be able to hike on uneven territory and be fully prepared for wild Atlantic coastal weather. Students may leave for Ireland anytime between March 25 and April 20 to begin their independent research prior to meeting up with the group for their four weeks of study in Donegal, and everyone must return by May 30.

    <description><p>In their 2017-19 Strategic Action Plan the Washington Student Achievement Council (WSAC) defines two state goals to be attained by 2023:</p><p>All adults in Washington will have a high school diploma or equivalent</p><p>At least 70 percent of Washington adults will have a postsecondary education</p><p>The overarching big question for this class will be: What policy strategies would be most effective in achieving these goals? In the process, we will explore the role and limitations of state policy in addressing state education goals, always keeping the focus on what Washington is doing to address these issues. During our weekend together, students will choose and explore in depth a policy strategy that they believe would be an effective approach to help Washington achieve these goals. Independent time will be provided for individual students to research in depth their chosen strategies.</p><p>.</p></description>

    <description><p>Why are there 795 million people in the world without enough food - even though agricultural output has almost doubled in the last half century? What explains the concentration of the vast majority of the world’s hungry in developing countries? How does financing and speculation affect agricultural commodity and food prices across the globe? Do alternative forms of energy affect food and agriculture production and prices? Can non-conventional small-scale methods of agriculture feed the world? In this program, we&apos;ll use questions like these to guide our study of the economics, politics and environmental impacts of the modern industrial food system.</p><p>This program will offer an introductory examination into the issues of food, distribution, policy, and hunger from a political economic perspective. We will survey and compare food and agriculture issues in both industrialized and developing countries. Using economic concepts, we will look to provide an analytical understanding of these issues. Topics such as hunger, agricultural policy, food distribution, food sovereignty, food security, food aid, biotechnology and the Green Revolution, as well as other related themes will be explored throughout the quarter.</p><p>In addition to studying and critiquing the existing system, we will spend significant time exploring more sustainable alternatives to mainstream methods of food production, distribution and consumption. Students will learn to apply economic theories studied in class to specific aspects of the food system and undertake an independent project on an alternative to mainstream food production.</p><p>Students will be assigned weekly readings in addition to guest lectures and films. Assignments will include problem sets, weekly papers, and a research-based term paper in which they integrate and apply class material to a particular country. Students will also be asked to do in-class presentations and present their work in an end-of-quarter symposium.</p></description>

    <minimum_credits>0</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>0</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>Rigorous quantitative and qualitative research is an important component of academic learning in Scientific Inquiry. Research opportunities allow science students to work on specific projects associated with faculty members’ expertise. Students typically begin by working in an apprenticeship model with faculty or laboratory staff and gradually take on more independent projects within the context of the specific research program as they gain experience. Students can develop vital skills in research design, data acquisition and interpretation, modeling and theoretical analysis, written and oral communication, collaboration and critical thinking. These are valuable skills for students pursuing a graduate degree or entering the job market.</p><p><strong>Brian Walter</strong> (mathematics) is interested in problems relating to graphs, combinatorial games, and especially, combinatorial games played on graphs. He would like to work with students who have a strong background in mathematics and/or computer science and are interested in applying their skills to open-ended problems relating to graphs and/or games.</p></description>

    <title>Organizational Sustainability in Theory and Practice</title>
    <minimum_credits>4</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>4</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>Communities and organizations have substantial environmental and social impacts at both local and global scales. How do we evaluate the positive and negative values of those impacts? How do we define and assess organizational practices and associated impacts? What should we be measuring and tracking? And how do we use assessments to stimulate and guide positive organizational change?</p><p>To understand the theoretical and practical dimensions of these questions, this class will explore a variety of assessment tools designed for corporations and other organizations, communities, and colleges/universities. Students will develop a broad understanding of organizational sustainability and assessment tools, and a deeper understanding of the Sustainability Tracking, Assessment &amp; Rating System (STARS) developed by AASHE, the Association for the Advancement of Higher Education. (Evergreen faculty and staff, along with MES students, helped develop the pilot version of STARS.) Class work will include planning for and beginning the data collection for Evergreen’s first AASHE STARS assessment of organizational sustainability since 2011. Students will have the opportunity to continue this work in subsequent quarters through internships.</p><p><strong>Faculty Biographies</strong></p><p><em>Scott Morgan, M.P.A.,</em>
      is the Director of Sustainability at The Evergreen State College. He has a B.S. in Chemistry from Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology in Terre Haute, Indiana, with an emphasis upon organic chemistry and biochemistry, and a Master of Public Administration from The Evergreen State College. Evergreen’s Office of Sustainability coordinates and guides on campus sustainability efforts as well as institutional collaborations with community-based groups. Scott has worked in agriculture and private industry, founded and managed a small non-profit, taught GED and pre-college classes, and has spent the past few years immersed in the public sector. This diverse set of perspectives informs his recognition that long-term sustainability will require a dynamic harmony between environmental, social, and economic health. He is also actively engaged with the Thurston Climate Action Team, a public/private partnership dedicated to creating a healthy and sustainable future for Thurston County, WA by encouraging, coordinating, and leading action on climate change.

    <title>Academic Writing at Evergreen</title>
    <minimum_credits>4</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>4</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>This writing intensive course has two purposes. The first is to help students develop as academic writers, to engage in writing as intellectual work. We will work on developing &quot;rhetorical reading&quot; skills--noticing not only what something is about, but also how it is put together. Building on common readings, students will write and revise several academic essays. Students with more academic experience will have the option of writing essays in areas related to their academic concentrations. A key element for all students will be engaging in productive revision processes. We will also explore academic writing at Evergreen--in particular, the purpose and practice of Evergreen&apos;s Academic Statement. This course can serve as an introduction to academic writing; for more advanced students, it offers the opportunity to develop a stronger practice of revision.</p></description>

    <description><p><span>Standard written English has enough irregularities to make any careful writer or teacher nervous.  Given that it&apos;s impossible to memorize everything, what&apos;s a writer or teacher to do?  Which strategies for working on conventions of written English are most productive for you as a writer?  Which ones will engage any writers you find yourself working with?  This course is based on the premise that learning grammar happens best in the context of meaningful writing.  Expect to write, and think about writing, and develop both your grammatical vocabulary and your grammatical skills, all with the aim of becoming a more effective writer.  Class time will spent in workshops, so regular participation in essential.  All writers welcome.</span></p></description>

    <title>Undergraduate Research in Scientific Inquiry with A. Brabban</title>
    <minimum_credits>0</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>0</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>Rigorous quantitative and qualitative research is an important component of academic learning in Scientific Inquiry. Research opportunities allow science students to work on specific projects associated with faculty members’ expertise. Students typically begin by working in an apprenticeship model with faculty or laboratory staff and gradually take on more independent projects within the context of the specific research program as they gain experience. Students can develop vital skills in research design, data acquisition and interpretation, modeling and theoretical analysis, written and oral communication, collaboration and critical thinking. These are valuable skills for students pursuing a graduate degree or entering the job market.</p><p><strong>Andrew Brabban</strong> (biotechnology) studies the physiology and biochemistry of prokaryotes of industrial and agricultural importance. Students who commit at least a full year to a research project, enrolling for 4 to 16 credits each quarter, will learn a broad range of microbiology (both aerobic and anaerobic techniques), molecular (DNA analysis and cloning), and biochemical techniques (chemical and pathway analysis, protein isolation). Students will also have opportunities for internships at the USDA and elsewhere, and to present data at national and international conferences.</p></description>

    <description><p><em>Because we as human beings spend a good deal of our time interacting with other people--being influenced by them, influencing them, being delighted, amused, saddened, and angered by them--it is natural that we develop hypotheses about social behavior. In that sense, we are all amateur social psychologists.</em></p><p>
      Eliot Aronson,
      <em>The Social Animal</em>
      , 2012
    </p><p>
      In this full-time program, we will explore the fundamentals of social psychology, the field that bridges psychology and sociology, to examine how people think, feel, and behave because of the real (or imagined) presence of social others. This program starts with the premise that human beings are inherently
      <em>social</em>
      beings informed, influenced, and constituted by the social world. This social psychological view of the self explores the ways that individuals are enmeshed and embodied within the social context both in the moment and the long-term, ever constructing who we are, how we present ourselves to the world, and how we are perceived by others.
    </p><p>Through reading classic and newly published research studies in social psychology, twice-weekly seminar, lecture/workshop, film, and writing and research assignments, we will cover the fundamental topics within the field including: conformity, emotions, persuasion, obedience to authority, social cognition, stereotyping, prejudice, aggression, pro-social behavior, attraction, and love. We will also learn about and practice social psychological research methods and data analysis, including systematic observation, online survey, experiment, and interview. A final project will be to conduct interview-based, qualitative research on a social psychological phenomenon of each student&apos;s own interest.</p></description>

    <minimum_credits>4</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>4</maximum_credits>
    <description><p><span>
        This course is intended as an overview of painting techniques, concepts, and related history.  It has been designed for a broad range of students to become competent with composition, brushwork, and color application.  
        <span>It is recommended that students have some previous experience with college-level drawing courses.  Projects will include still-life, landscape, portraiture and color field abstraction paintings. Students will explore specific techniques through group activities which will provide the basis for individual exploration.  Thematic concepts will be discussed as primers to aide students toward loosely narrative work. Class time will be devoted to studio work, presentations, demonstrations, and critiques.  In addition, students will be expected to work outside of the designated class time to complete all required assignments.</span>

    <title>Public Service Delivery Networks</title>
    <minimum_credits>4</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>4</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>An important contemporary administrative issue is the delivery of public goods and services to citizens. This course will review how governments deliver services, primarily focusing on contracting and the resulting delivery networks. As Laurence O’Toole proclaims “Those tasked with public management must often seek to operate on structurally uncertain terrain, firmament that can include ties with patterns of not-for-profits and profit-seeking entities as well as multiple formally governed institutions”. Public sector organizations – at the federal, state, and local levels – form working relationships with communities, other governments, nonprofit, and for-profit firms through contracts. The course will discuss the tools managers need to form, operate, terminate, or transform these contracts. Students will examine contracting environments of their own interests and understand the dynamics, technical, and political aspects of contracting with different types of vendors in public service delivery networks. </p></description>

    <description><p>This considers methods, techniques, and directed experiences in fund raising and resource development practices. Theories of fund raising, donor motivation, leadership and ethical considerations are highlighted. The purpose of this course is to provide a foundation of knowledge about methods and techniques by which voluntary, nonprofit organizations plan, budget and raise funds. This is accomplished through an exploration of the theories and practice of philanthropy, non-profit operations and leadership. Students will also develop a deeper sense of abundance and scarcity of resources as well as the historical significance of philanthropy in American society.</p></description>

We will read from a wide range of authors and genres from a wide range of time periods, and we will experiment both with writing styles and with lab equipment. We will conduct long-term ecological monitoring and embrace revision in our compositions. Our 1000-acre campus forest and our 750,000-book library will be the primary fieldsites of our interdisciplinary inquiry. Call these branches of our investigation “forest space” and “book space.”</p><p>We will ask, and try to answer, tough questions that challenge how we view the world. What needs to be the case for things to be otherwise? This question, in particular, will allow us to address the fact and possibility of change --- of transformation and metamorphosis --- in both the human and the natural worlds, and perhaps also to understand some of the ways in which our understandings of nature and culture have come into being in the first place. What is the relationship between evolution and revolution, between photosynthesis and rhetoric? How do patterns influence processes? How can we identify, define, describe, observe, and analyze the objects of our inquiry—whether that be a 14-line sonnet on the page of a book, or a meter-squared quadrat in the forest?</p><p>This program will give you the chance to stretch your creative, analytical, logical, and critical muscles while preparing you for a successful journey through Evergreen. No experience necessary, some assembly required, all students welcome. We proceed on the premise that there’s no such thing as bad weather, only bad gear. So come prepared to write and to perambulate outdoors, and bring a good notebook and a good writing utensil, a good pair of boots and good raingear. The only way to do this right is by writing, and going for some long walks in the woods.</p><p><strong>This program will be repeated in spring quarter.

    <description><p>This course explores the historical evolution of federal, state and local housing policy. Students will learn about how analytical and political frameworks are used to create, evaluate and shape housing programs, projects and services. We will examine the continuum of subsidies and programs that are provided to everyone from high income earners and investors to people who are chronically homeless. We will compare and contrast how different housing policies are used to provide shelter, stimulate the economy, protect the environment and support sustainable growth.</p></description>

    <description><p>This is an intermediate to advanced class where students will be using older photographic methods and techniques.  We’ll be spending a significant part of this class learning about and using view cameras. Additionally, we&apos;ll be working with UV printing, lith films, pinhole cameras, and more.  There will be assignments based in these processes, and each student will produce a final project.  We’ll also look at the work of contemporary and historical artists using these methods.</p></description>

    <description><p><strong>This program is a repeat of the program in fall quarter. Students who take the program in fall should not register for the winter quarter program.</strong></p><p>What is knowledge? What is a document? What is a poem, an image, a medium, or a discipline? What does it mean to be asking these questions today, as we interface with multiple networks? In this reading- and writing-intensive program, we’ll explore real and virtual archives, emphasizing reading and research skills as well as media literacy. We’ll be centering many of our activities on the Evergreen Library.</p><p>Broadly, we’ll engage with two complementary activities: classification and critique. Through the former, we’ll explore the process of constructing structures of knowledge; through the latter, we’ll practice analyzing and criticizing them. As we synthesize these two approaches, we’ll be able to examine the social nature and construction of knowledge. With methods drawn from philosophy and library science, we’ll practice reading for both depth and breadth: close reading of particular texts and the efficient survey of potentially relevant resources. Assignments in this program will emphasize reading, writing and research practice, as well as creative experimentation with concepts and information.</p><p>We’ll critically engage with various library resources while developing research skills that will be valuable for future academic and creative projects. As we practice our skills in the use of various knowledge organization systems, we’ll also examine their conceptual underpinnings and social contexts. What defines a creative work and what are its boundaries? What does it mean for a book, a picture or a building to be ‘about’ something? What does a given knowledge structure tell us about its creators’ values, assumptions, and interests?</p><p>We’ll address the question of knowledge beginning with a study of the figure of the philosopher from Plato’s allegory of the cave to Kant and Foucault’s critiques of enlightenment. We’ll inflect our understanding of knowledge through concepts such as technical images, utopias, heterotopias, and pornotopias, drawn from media theory, narrative and experimental poetics, and gender and queer theory. This trajectory will allow us to situate ourselves personally, ethically, and politically in relation to concepts and manifestations of knowledge, medium, and archive.</p><p>In addition to the above-mentioned, our readings will include Thomas Kuhn, Vilèm Flusser, Beatriz Preciado, Jorge Luis Borges and Samuel R. Delany.</p><p><strong>This program will be repeated in spring quarter. Students who take this program in winter should not register for the spring quarter repeat.</strong></p></description>

    <title>Undergraduate Research in Scientific Inquiry with M. Paros</title>
    <minimum_credits>0</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>0</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>Rigorous quantitative and qualitative research is an important component of academic learning in Scientific Inquiry. Research opportunities allow science students to work on specific projects associated with faculty members’ expertise. Students typically begin by working in an apprenticeship model with faculty or laboratory staff and gradually take on more independent projects within the context of the specific research program as they gain experience. Students can develop vital skills in research design, data acquisition and interpretation, modeling and theoretical analysis, written and oral communication, collaboration and critical thinking. These are valuable skills for students pursuing a graduate degree or entering the job market.</p><p><strong>Mike Paros</strong> (physiology, microbiology, veterinary medicine) is interested in animal health, diseases that affect the animal agriculture industry, and basic ecology of bacteriophage in physiologic systems. Currently funded research includes the development of bacteriophage therapy for dairy cattle mastitis. A number of hands-on laboratory projects are available to students interested in pursuing careers in science, with a particular emphasis on microbiology.</p></description>

    <title>Undergraduate Research in Scientific Inquiry with J. Neitzel</title>
    <minimum_credits>0</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>0</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>Rigorous quantitative and qualitative research is an important component of academic learning in Scientific Inquiry. Research opportunities allow science students to work on specific projects associated with faculty members’ expertise. Students typically begin by working in an apprenticeship model with faculty or laboratory staff and gradually take on more independent projects within the context of the specific research program as they gain experience. Students can develop vital skills in research design, data acquisition and interpretation, modeling and theoretical analysis, written and oral communication, collaboration and critical thinking. These are valuable skills for students pursuing a graduate degree or entering the job market.</p><p><strong>Jim Neitzel</strong> (biochemistry) uses methods from organic and analytical chemistry to study biologically interesting molecules. A major focus of his current work is on fatty acids; in particular, finding spectroscopic and chromatographic methods to identify fatty acids in complex mixtures and to detect changes that occur in fats during processing or storage. This has relevance both for foods and in biodiesel production. The other major area of interest is in plant natural products, such as salicylates. Work is in process screening local plants for the presence of these molecules, which are important plant-defense signals. Work is also supported in determining the nutritional value of indigenous plants. Students with a background and interest in organic or analytical biochemistry will contribute to this work.</p></description>

    <title>Reservation-Based, Community-Determined Program: Contemporary Indian Communities in a Global Society (Peninsula)</title>
    <minimum_credits>12</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>12</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>This program&apos;s overall theme prepares students to understand the structural inequalities of wealth and economic development. Students will examine social problems in Native communities through multiple methods and perspectives and grow to understand the impacts of social and political movements, both past and present, by comparing Indigenous societies in the world. Each quarter, a nine-credit upper-division interdisciplinary sub-theme will be taught as part of the curriculum for the Reservation-Based, Community-Determined (RBCD) Program.</p><p>
      The fall 2016 sub-theme,
      <em>Indigenous Pathways to Rich and Thriving Communities,</em>
      will explore contemporary economic development issues in tribal communities. Students will examine the field of community and economic development, explore the values, vision, and principles that guide community and economic development efforts, the process of development, and change strategies such as asset building and community organizing. Students will address critical issues such as poverty, racism, and disinvestment and investigate challenges facing tribal communities. Students will explore political aspects of tribal sovereignty and continued development of self-governance as the basis for tribal community and economic development, self-determination, and community sustainability, all with a focus toward promoting, advocating for, and understanding economic development in Indian Country.  
    </p><p>
      The sub-theme for winter 2017 is
      <em>Building Healthy Communities</em>
      . Students will examine the field of social problems and policies while exploring the values, vision, and principles that guide efforts to identify and resolve social problems. They will study challenges to tribal communities, the process of building healthy communities and change strategies including community organizing and community empowerment. This component will explore the political aspects of tribal sovereignty and continued development of self-governance, as the basis for tribal community building and self-determination in Indian Country.
    </p><p>
      The sub-theme for spring 2017 is
      <em>Comparing Indigenous Societies through Social and Political Movements,</em>
      which uses a variety of methods, materials, and approaches to interpret, analyze, evaluate, and synthesize the impact of indigenous peoples’ history and politics on 21st century indigenous societies. Students will focus on movements and activism that changed Indigenous societies at various levels of the social/political landscape from local to international. Students will conduct research, debate, discuss, and analyze various aspects of Native American activism that altered or revised a community. Students will gain an understanding of ways in which diverse cultural, religious sociological, linguistic, ideological, historical, and communication factors play a role in Indigenous social movements throughout the world, and how efforts to promote human relations, international consciousness, and interconnectedness of Indigenous peoples can result in positive changes in the lives of Indigenous people everywhere.
    </p><p>Students will attend four, daylong upper-division Saturday classes at the Longhouse on the Evergreen Olympia campus each quarter. During the year, students will attend a total of three, two-credit classes in morning sessions. In the afternoon sessions, students will attend Battlegrounds, a one-credit class based on original case studies about contemporary issues in Indian Country.</p></description>

    <title>Reservation-Based, Community-Determined Program: Contemporary Indian Communities in a Global Society (Muckleshoot)</title>
    <minimum_credits>12</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>12</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>This program&apos;s overall theme prepares students to understand the structural inequalities of wealth and economic development. Students will examine social problems in Native communities through multiple methods and perspectives and grow to understand the impacts of social and political movements, both past and present, by comparing Indigenous societies in the world. Each quarter, a nine-credit upper-division interdisciplinary sub-theme will be taught as part of the curriculum for the Reservation-Based, Community-Determined (RBCD) Program.</p><p>
      The fall 2016 sub-theme,
      <em>Indigenous Pathways to Rich and Thriving Communities,</em>
      will explore contemporary economic development issues in tribal communities. Students will examine the field of community and economic development, explore the values, vision, and principles that guide community and economic development efforts, the process of development, and change strategies such as asset building and community organizing. Students will address critical issues such as poverty, racism, and disinvestment and investigate challenges facing tribal communities. Students will explore political aspects of tribal sovereignty and continued development of self-governance as the basis for tribal community and economic development, self-determination, and community sustainability, all with a focus toward promoting, advocating for, and understanding economic development in Indian Country.  
    </p><p>
      The sub-theme for winter 2017 is
      <em>Building Healthy Communities</em>
      . Students will examine the field of social problems and policies while exploring the values, vision, and principles that guide efforts to identify and resolve social problems. They will study challenges to tribal communities, the process of building healthy communities and change strategies including community organizing and community empowerment. This component will explore the political aspects of tribal sovereignty and continued development of self-governance, as the basis for tribal community building and self-determination in Indian Country.
    </p><p>
      The sub-theme for spring 2017 is
      <em>Comparing Indigenous Societies through Social and Political Movements,</em>
      which uses a variety of methods, materials, and approaches to interpret, analyze, evaluate, and synthesize the impact of indigenous peoples’ history and politics on 21st century indigenous societies. Students will focus on movements and activism that changed Indigenous societies at various levels of the social/political landscape from local to international. Students will conduct research, debate, discuss, and analyze various aspects of Native American activism that altered or revised a community. Students will gain an understanding of ways in which diverse cultural, religious sociological, linguistic, ideological, historical, and communication factors play a role in Indigenous social movements throughout the world, and how efforts to promote human relations, international consciousness, and interconnectedness of Indigenous peoples can result in positive changes in the lives of Indigenous people everywhere.
    </p><p>Students will attend four, daylong upper-division Saturday classes at the Longhouse on the Evergreen Olympia campus each quarter. During the year, students will attend a total of three, two-credit classes in morning sessions. In the afternoon sessions, students will attend Battlegrounds, a one-credit class based on original case studies about contemporary issues in Indian Country.</p></description>

This course is an introduction to statistics for students with limited if any formal exposure to data and data analysis, and no experience with statistics. This class will introduce the student to the statistical process, including data collection, ways of organizing data, an introduction to data analysis, and an opportunity to learn how practitioners present their findings.  We will examine several case studies, explore how data is used in explaining unusual events, and develop a more critical understanding about how statistics allows us to understand the world around us.</span></p></description>

    <title>Spanish, Beginning I</title>
    <minimum_credits>4</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>4</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>Have you wanted to learn Spanish so you can communicate face-to-face when you take that long-dreamed of trip to the sunny beaches of Mexico, Central or South America?   Have you noticed that you hear more Spanish being spoken in the various community locations you frequent such as grocery, hardware and department stores?   Are you curious about the culture of the people that now constitute the largest ethnic minority in the United States?  Have you come to the conclusion that being able to communicate in Spanish would greatly increase your professional or academic flexibility and value?  Did you study Spanish previously and want to “brush up” on your skills? Any and all of these are excellent reasons to study Spanish, and one of the Spanish classes offered at Evergreen will meet your needs.</p><p>You may need to start with Beginning Spanish I  if you have little or no experience with learning the language or if your previous experience with studying the language was some years ago.  </p><p>Classes are highly interactive, safe environments to practice your new skills.   A wide range of learning activities is provided so that students learn to read, write, speak and understand the language.   Students use a written text and workbook for self-study.   An online learning vehicle is also used so that students are immersed in the various components of the language.   Students have access to a language lab that incorporates Rosetta Stone for additional practice.   Cultural activities are integrated into the classes so that students learn not only the language but also the major cultural values and traditions of countries where Spanish is spoken.   A culminating language fair is held during spring quarter in conjunction with other language classes and provides language students with opportunities to display their own learning as well as learn about the other cultures represented by those languages.   Come join us and begin expanding your world – present and future!</p><p>
      The following is a short description of the material covered in Beginning Spanish I: Beginning Spanish I students acquire the skills to understand written and oral language and to express themselves in written and oral language about the following: greetings, introductions, expressions of courtesy, academic life, days of the week, schedules, family, identifying and describing people, professions and occupations, leisure activities, sports, asking for and giving directions within a city or campus, travel and vacation arrangements and activities, months and seasons of the year and weather.    Students acquire the following grammatical structures: use of the verbs
      <em>hay</em>
      and
      <em>gustar</em>
      , conjugation of verbs in the present tense including stem-changing verbs,
      <em>ser</em>
      and
      <em>estar</em>
      , noun/adjective agreement, subject/verb agreement, and various idiomatic expressions related to the topics studied.

    <description><p>Rigorous quantitative and qualitative research is an important component of academic learning in Scientific Inquiry. Research opportunities allow science students to work on specific projects associated with faculty members’ expertise. Students typically begin by working in an apprenticeship model with faculty or laboratory staff and gradually take on more independent projects within the context of the specific research program as they gain experience. Students can develop vital skills in research design, data acquisition and interpretation, modeling and theoretical analysis, written and oral communication, collaboration and critical thinking. These are valuable skills for students pursuing a graduate degree or entering the job market.</p><p><strong>Lydia</strong><strong>McKinstry</strong> (organic chemistry) is interested in organic synthesis research, including asymmetric synthesis methodology, chemical reaction dynamics, and small molecule synthesis. One specific study involves the design and synthesis of enzyme inhibitor molecules to be used as effective laboratory tools with which to study the mechanistic steps of programmed cell death (e.g., in cancer cells). Students with a background in organic chemistry and biology will gain experience with the laboratory techniques of organic synthesis,as well as the techniques of spectroscopy.</p></description>

    <description><p>Course Description TBA.</p><p><strong>Faculty Biography</strong><br/><em>Erin Martin, Ph.D.</em> , is an aquatic biogeochemist whose research focuses on examining the role of rivers in the global carbon cycle. Rivers are large sources of carbon to both the atmosphere and the ocean and are consequently critical to our understanding of the global carbon cycle.  While working in the Amazon Basin, her research demonstrated that bacteria living in the river produce high levels of carbon dioxide through respiration, and this carbon dioxide is subsequently lost to the atmosphere.  Her current research in the Mekong Basin (i.e. Cambodia) focuses on characterizing the type of organic carbon that is exported by large rivers to the ocean.  Specifically, she uses molecular tracers to determine where in the watershed the carbon originates from, and uses radiocarbon analyses to determine the age of this material.  Such information is necessary in order to understand the preservation of terrestrial carbon in the ocean, which can affect atmospheric carbon dioxide levels over long time scales.  Through her training (master’s and doctoral degrees from the School of Oceanography at the University of Washington), Erin has research experience working in streams, rivers, lakes, and the ocean.  Additional interests include ocean acidification, estuarine ecology, evaluating the impacts of dams on downstream processes, and microbial ecology.  Her past and present research has been conducted through collaborations with colleagues in Brazil, Cambodia, and the Pacific Northwest.</p></description>

    <title>Sustainable Forestry in Fire-prone Landscapes</title>
    <minimum_credits>4</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>4</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>This class provides an introduction to 21st-century forest ecosystem management, the design of forest restoration treatments, and the role of fire in dry forests. A three-day field trip will emphasize the unique issues facing restoration management of fire prone landscapes of the Pacific Northwest. The course materials will explore the underlying science and practice of sustainable forestry, and the interface with societal and economic forces including adapting policies to address 100 years of fire suppression, and climate change. The overall course objective is to increase student literacy and effectiveness in addressing natural resources management issues.</p><p><strong>Faculty Biography</strong><br/><em>Richard Bigley, Ph.D.,</em>
      is a forest ecologist who teaches sustainable forestry and on occasion a forest ecology class. His current work focuses on the restoration of riparian forests to older forest conditions in western Washington, and the ecology and management of headwater streams and wetlands. He works for the Washington State Department of Natural Resources (DNR). Over the last 21 years with DNR, he has served as the team leader for the Forest Ecology, Wildlife Science and the Habitat Conservation Plan Monitoring and Adaptive Management Teams. He also advises other organizations on the development of conservation plans. Before DNR, he worked as an ecologist for the Forest Service PNW Experiment Station and private industry. Richard earned a Ph.D. in Forest Ecology and Silviculture and a M.Sc. in Botany from the University of British Columbia. He has been an Assistant Professor at the University of Washington, College of the Environment, School of Forestry since 1994. As member of the Northern Spotted owl “5-year review” panel in 2004, Richard was a contributor to the first comprehensive evaluation of the scientific information on the Northern Spotted owl since the time of its listing as threatened under the Endangered Species Act in 1990. After his family, his passions are the science of natural resources management and conservation, and boating.

    <title>Environmental Humanities: Argument as Art/Art as Argument</title>
    <minimum_credits>4</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>4</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>Discourse in environmental governance, law, and policy consists almost entirely of argumentative writing. But how does art make arguments? Insofar as effective art and literature provoke feeling and reflection by invoking uncertainty and ambiguity, what do they have to do with argument? By what strategies do artists and writers communicate the transformation of their own point of view, their own movement from ignorance to knowledge? And what might we learn from them about how to translate our insights, persuade others of the validity of our perspectives, and teach new ways of seeing and knowing to myriad audiences? This creative and critical writing class will explore and experiment with argument as art, and art as argument.</p><p>We are often urged to think about audience when we compose arguments. Who are we trying to convince, and why? What should our attitude be towards (the question of) audience? How can we better understand the mutable and contingent relationship between writer and audience (readers, listeners, interlocutors)? How can we use our imagination to help clarify form, content, tone, and mode of address? The study of artists and writers concerned with environmental issues can help us think about our audiences and the most effective ways of engaging, challenging, educating, or motivating them.</p><p>The course will entail weekly readings and occasional screenings that exemplify artistic approaches to arguments concerned in a range of ways with environmental questions. Course readings will serve as models of argumentation as well as objects of analysis and inquiry. Creative and critical exercises will help students develop their academic writing and their ability to communicate effectively with diverse audiences.</p></description>

    <minimum_credits>4</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>4</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>What&apos;s the relationship between language and thinking, or between thinking and writing, and what does that relationship mean for us as writers?  The purpose of this course is explore the relationship between writing and thinking, language and thought, and to understand how becoming aware of that relationship can help us become more effective writers, better critical thinkers, and stronger analytical readers. Students in this course will tackle the question of writing and thinking head-on,  reading about it, writing about it, and reflecting on their own experiences as writers and thinkers. We&apos;ll also examine what it means to &quot;reflect&quot; on our experiences--the role reflection plays in learning.</p></description>

    <description><div class="description"><p>Rigorous quantitative and qualitative research is an important component of academic learning in Environmental Studies. This independent learning opportunity is designed to allow advanced students to delve into real-world research with faculty who are currently engaged in specific projects. The program will help students develop vital skills in research design, data acquisition and interpretation, written and oral communication, collaboration and critical thinking skills—all of which are of particular value for students who are pursuing a graduate degree, as well as for graduates who are already in the job market.</p><p><strong>Alison Styring</strong> studies birds. Current activity in her lab includes avian bioacoustics and avian monitoring and research in Evergreen’s campus forest and other nearby locations. Bioacoustic research includes field monitoring of local birds using audio recordings and microphone arrays, and editing and identifying avian songs and calls from an extensive collection of sounds from the campus forest as well as tropical forest sites in Borneo. Local research projects in the campus forest and nearby locations include Pacific wren mating and life-history strategy, cavity formation and use by cavity-nesting birds (and other cavity-dependent species), and monitoring long-term trends in bird populations and communities using a variety of standard approaches.</p></div></description>

    <title>Undergraduate Research in the Humanities with N. Koppelman</title>
    <minimum_credits>0</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>0</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>Students of the humanities who are nearing the end of their Evergreen education may wish to pursue a major research project, senior thesis or capstone project in their particular field of interest. Often, the goal is to contruct an original argument around a particular body of literature, set of ideas or historical events. These kinds of projects develop advanced research skills in the humanities, including the ability to read deeply and critically in a particular field, and to discover and engage with important theoretical writings in that field. Students will also gain valuable skills in reading, analyzing, synthesizing, writing and editing long pieces of complex prose. The best kinds of this work will be invaluable for graduate school applications, and will be an asset to those entering the job market directly following graduation.</p><p><strong>Nancy Koppelman</strong> (American studies) specializes in American social, literary, and intellectual history until 1920. Students who wish to study in these fields are welcome to propose research projects and senior theses. Particular interests include the social and intellectual history of the Puritans; the founding generation, immigrants, the working class, and the middle class; industrialization and reform movements; pragmatic philosophy; the history of childhood; and the history of technology and consumer culture. Students are also welcome to work with Nancy on her ongoing research projects on the histories of social/economic mobility and of individual physical movement.</p></description>

    <title>Sustainability: Reimagining the Built Environment and the Written Word</title>
    <minimum_credits>16</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>16</maximum_credits>
    <description><p><strong>This program is a repeat of the program in fall quarter.  Students who take the program in fall should not register for the winter quarter program.</strong></p><p>In this program, we will explore issues of sustainability in the context of the built environment and the community around us.  Through observation, academic and creative writing, research and presentation students will work to define sustainability in architecture--in new, existing, and hybrid structures.  Together, we will answer: How do elements relate to the users?  What is the influence of site?  How is energy use considered?  What does net-zero mean?   How can re-visioning the existing fabric work to achieve more sustainable structures and communities? </p><p>Our focus in this writing-intensive program will be on pursuing ideas and concepts that re-use, re-habilitate, re-energize, and re-define the existing fabric of the urban and suburban built environment.  Through discussion in small peer groups and critical and creative writings, we will examine the ideas presented in the literature.  Students will also practice honing their close reading skills through reflective writing exercises and will develop and articulate their new understandings by means of response papers, reflective journals, bibliographic summaries, and creative assignments. Students improve their ability to write thesis-driven essays defended with evidence from the assigned texts in weekly workshops. They will also be challenged to re-imagine and revitalize the conventional notion of an essay.</p><p>Students will visit local and regional examples of civic and commercial projects that exemplify sustainability goals to help students envision how these ideas are incorporated and expressed in the built form.  Through group research projects focused on site influences and design choices of existing projects, students will identify design elements, document materials choices, and understand energy use.  As part of a culminating project, students will create annotated site plans and use basic 2-D drawing skills in developing conceptual design proposals, supported by written arguments to propose solutions that can re-imagine and re-define a new use for an existing structure.</p><p> </p></description>

    <title>Undergraduate Research in Scientific Inquiry with P. Schofield</title>
    <minimum_credits>0</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>0</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>Rigorous quantitative and qualitative research is an important component of academic learning in Scientific Inquiry. Research opportunities allow science students to work on specific projects associated with faculty members’ expertise. Students typically begin by working in an apprenticeship model with faculty or laboratory staff and gradually take on more independent projects within the context of the specific research program as they gain experience. Students can develop vital skills in research design, data acquisition and interpretation, modeling and theoretical analysis, written and oral communication, collaboration and critical thinking. These are valuable skills for students pursuing a graduate degree or entering the job market.</p><p><strong>Paula Schofield</strong> (organic, polymer, materials chemistry) is interested in the interdisciplinary fields of biodegradable plastics and biomedical polymers. Research in the field of biodegradable plastics is becoming increasingly important to replace current petroleum-derived materials and to reduce the environmental impact of plastic wastes. Modification of starch through copolymerization and use of bacterial polyesters show promise in this endeavor. Specific projects within biomedical polymers involve the synthesis of poly (lactic acid) copolymers that have potential for use in tissue engineering. Students with a background in chemistry and biology will gain experience in the synthesis and characterization of these novel polymer materials. Students will present their work at American Chemical Society (ACS) conferences.</p></description>

    <title>Undergraduate Research in the Humanities with S. Davis</title>
    <minimum_credits>0</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>0</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>Students of the humanities who are nearing the end of their Evergreen education may wish to pursue a major research project, senior thesis or capstone project in their particular field of interest. Often, the goal is to contruct an original argument around a particular body of literature, set of ideas or historical events. These kinds of projects develop advanced research skills in the humanities, including the ability to read deeply and critically in a particular field, and to discover and engage with important theoretical writings in that field. Students will also gain valuable skills in reading, analyzing, synthesizing, writing and editing long pieces of complex prose. The best kinds of this work will be invaluable for graduate school applications, and will be an asset to those entering the job market directly following graduation.</p><p><strong>Stacey Davis</strong>
      (European history) specializes in French history from the 18th century to the present, as well as the history of French colonies in North and West Africa. Students who wish to study European social, cultural, political, intellectual or religious history from the Middle Ages to the present, including topics in the history of gender and sociocultural aspects of the history of art, are welcome to propose research projects. Students are welcome to work with Dr. Davis on her ongoing research projects on 19th-century political prisoners, notions of citizenship and democracy in modern Europe, memory and the history of aging.

    <description><p>Rigorous quantitative and qualitative research is an important component of academic learning in Scientific Inquiry. Research opportunities allow science students to work on specific projects associated with faculty members’ expertise. Students typically begin by working in an apprenticeship model with faculty or laboratory staff and gradually take on more independent projects within the context of the specific research program as they gain experience.

These are valuable skills for students pursuing a graduate degree or entering the job market.</p><p><strong>Rebecca Sunderman</strong> (inorganic/materials chemistry, physical chemistry) is interested in the synthesis and property characterization of new bismuth-containing materials. These compounds have been characterized as electronic conductors, attractive activators for luminescent materials, second harmonic generators, and oxidation catalysts for several organic compounds. Traditional solid-state synthesis methods will be utilized to prepare new complex bismuth oxides. Once synthesized, powder x-ray diffraction patterns will be obtained and material properties such as conductivity, melting point, biocidal tendency, coherent light production, and magnetic behavior will be examined when appropriate.</p></description>

    <title>Undergraduate Research in the Humanities with T. Speller</title>
    <minimum_credits>0</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>0</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>Students of the humanities who are nearing the end of their Evergreen education may wish to pursue a major research project, senior thesis or capstone project in their particular field of interest. Often, the goal is to contruct an original argument around a particular body of literature, set of ideas or historical events. These kinds of projects develop advanced research skills in the humanities, including the ability to read deeply and critically in a particular field, and to discover and engage with important theoretical writings in that field. Students will also gain valuable skills in reading, analyzing, synthesizing, writing and editing long pieces of complex prose. The best kinds of this work will be invaluable for graduate school applications, and will be an asset to those entering the job market directly following graduation.</p><p><strong>Trevor Speller</strong> (British/anglophone literature) specializes in British and Anglophone literature from the 17th century to the present. Students who wish to study literature and literary theory from the Middle Ages to the present are welcome to propose research projects, including capstone projects and senior theses. Previous projects have included studies of Virginia Woolf, Romantic women writers, and travel writing. Dr. Speller is looking for students to assist with his ongoing research projects around the rise of the novel, experimental literature, and conceptions of modernity.</p></description>

    <title>Reservation-Based, Community-Determined Program: Contemporary Indian Communities in a Global Society (Nisqually)</title>
    <minimum_credits>12</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>12</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>This program&apos;s overall theme prepares students to understand the structural inequalities of wealth and economic development. Students will examine social problems in Native communities through multiple methods and perspectives and grow to understand the impacts of social and political movements, both past and present, by comparing Indigenous societies in the world. Each quarter, a nine-credit upper-division interdisciplinary sub-theme will be taught as part of the curriculum for the Reservation-Based, Community-Determined (RBCD) Program.</p><p>
      The fall 2016 sub-theme,
      <em>Indigenous Pathways to Rich and Thriving Communities,</em>
      will explore contemporary economic development issues in tribal communities. Students will examine the field of community and economic development, explore the values, vision, and principles that guide community and economic development efforts, the process of development, and change strategies such as asset building and community organizing. Students will address critical issues such as poverty, racism, and disinvestment and investigate challenges facing tribal communities. Students will explore political aspects of tribal sovereignty and continued development of self-governance as the basis for tribal community and economic development, self-determination, and community sustainability, all with a focus toward promoting, advocating for, and understanding economic development in Indian Country.  
    </p><p>
      The sub-theme for winter 2017 is
      <em>Building Healthy Communities</em>
      . Students will examine the field of social problems and policies while exploring the values, vision, and principles that guide efforts to identify and resolve social problems. They will study challenges to tribal communities, the process of building healthy communities and change strategies including community organizing and community empowerment. This component will explore the political aspects of tribal sovereignty and continued development of self-governance, as the basis for tribal community building and self-determination in Indian Country.
    </p><p>
      The sub-theme for spring 2017 is
      <em>Comparing Indigenous Societies through Social and Political Movements,</em>
      which uses a variety of methods, materials, and approaches to interpret, analyze, evaluate, and synthesize the impact of indigenous peoples’ history and politics on 21st century indigenous societies. Students will focus on movements and activism that changed Indigenous societies at various levels of the social/political landscape from local to international. Students will conduct research, debate, discuss, and analyze various aspects of Native American activism that altered or revised a community. Students will gain an understanding of ways in which diverse cultural, religious sociological, linguistic, ideological, historical, and communication factors play a role in Indigenous social movements throughout the world, and how efforts to promote human relations, international consciousness, and interconnectedness of Indigenous peoples can result in positive changes in the lives of Indigenous people everywhere.
    </p><p>Students will attend four, daylong upper-division Saturday classes at the Longhouse on the Evergreen Olympia campus each quarter. During the year, students will attend a total of three, two-credit classes in morning sessions. In the afternoon sessions, students will attend Battlegrounds, a one-credit class based on original case studies about contemporary issues in Indian Country.</p></description>

    <description><p>This is an opportunity for students to work on faculty-driven scholarly and creative projects. By working with faculty in a studio and research “apprentice” model, students will gain hands-on experience in visual arts studio practices, film/media production practices, the creative writing workshop focused on craft, critical research and writing, library and archival research practices, and much more.</p><p><strong>Naima Lowe</strong> (experimental media and performance art) creates films, videos, performances and written works that explore issues of race, gender, and embodiment. The majority of her work includes an archival research element that explores historical social relationships and mythic identities. She is currently working on a series of short films and performances that explore racial identity in rural settings. Students working with Naima would have opportunities to learn media production and post-production skills (including storyboarding, scripting, 16mm and HD video shooting, location scouting, audio recording, audio/video editing, etc) through working with a small crew comprised of students and professional artists. Students would also have opportunities to do archival and historical research on African-Americans living in rural settings, and on literature, film and visual art that deals with similar themes. Students are generally best equipped for this option if they have taken at least one full year of studies in Media or Visual Arts in a program such as MediaWorks, NonFiction Media, or its equivalent.</p></description>

    <minimum_credits>16</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>16</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>An aquarium is a tank with at least one transparent side allowing observation of its water-dwelling inhabitants. For almost two millennia humans have been keeping organisms in aquaria for observation and investigation. This program will examine husbandry of organisms in aquaria. We will study the theory and practice of keeping a modern aquarium. The diversity of organisms suitable for aquarium life, metabolic demands of these organisms, aquarium water chemistry, and other areas related to successful maintenance of aquatic organisms will be covered. Topics in applied chemistry and applied biology directly related to aquarium science require that students have previous laboratory skills in biology and chemistry. In seminar, we will explore the history of private and public aquaria, and we will consider ethical questions surrounding captive animals in aquaria. Students will work in small groups to manage their own aquaria. We will spend one week visiting public aquariums on the Pacific Coast, and we will to learn about large scale aquarium management.</p></description>

      This is an opportunity for a small number of Sophomore-Senior students with a strong background in one or a combination of the following: visual art, art history, literature, creative writing, media theory, cultural studies, critical race studies, or African-American studies. Students with this background will participate in all of the activities and readings of

      , but also be asked to complete longer and more in-depth assignments and a large-scale project that will be developed over the course of the two quarters. These students will also act as peer mentors for the Freshman in the class, and will have opportunities to develop and supervise workshops and activities with those students.

    <description><p>In an era of recession, corporate malfeasance and political upheaval, how does a public organization maintain a responsible course and achieve the purpose for which it was created?</p><p>We’ll answer this question by first examining the function of audit in a democratic society—the function of oversight as a collective expectation and a political mandate, as well as a means for safeguarding and optimizing the use of communal resources and infrastructure.  With this historical and social background as our context, we will then explore the internal audit function as a crucial activity in the organizational life of a public entity, with special emphasis on the practical methods by which students can reasonably assure the success of the organizations they lead. </p><p>We’ll study the purposes, standards, and best practices of internal audit as it is (or should be) practiced in public organizations, with special emphasis on the concepts of risk, control, assurance and governance.  As civic leaders, we’ll also explore how to promote and engage with the internal audit function to achieve desired outcomes for our organizations and the public we serve.  The course will provide practical insight into organizational architecture and processes, and offer opportunities to reflect on professional commitments, public expectations, and the strategies available for achieving organizational success through internal audit and oversight.</p></description>

    <title>Undergraduate Projects in Critical and Creative Practices with J. Sandoz</title>
    <minimum_credits>0</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>0</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>This is an opportunity for students to work on faculty-driven scholarly and creative projects. By working with faculty in a studio and research “apprentice” model, students will gain hands-on experience in visual arts studio practices, film/media production practices, the creative writing workshop focused on craft, critical research and writing, library and archival research practices, and much more.</p><p><strong>Joli Sandoz</strong>
      (creative nonfiction) directs scholarly research focused on critique and/or the writing of creative nonfiction, or critique and/or design of analog games.  This opportunity is open to people nearing the end of their Evergreen education, who may wish to pursue a major research project, senior thesis, or capstone project in their particular relevant interest. Projects of this type bring together theory and application in the critical and creative pursuit of knowledge new to the researcher.  Outstanding creative and critical projects add value to graduate school and job applications, and can enhance skills in synthesis, analysis, and creative thinking and practice. Sandoz specializes in personal and lyric essays, and in board and card games; she does not sponsor projects centered on autobiography, memoir, or computer games (interesting as those topics are).

Her recent work in microbiology has focused on the biodiversity and distribution of Tardigrades in different ecosystems. She also aims to better understand the evolutionary principles that underlie the emergence, spread and containment of infectious disease by studying the coevolution of retroviruses and their hosts. Lastly, she is conducting snail surveys in Washington state to better characterize the species in the state, something that hasn’t been done in many decades. Depending on the project, students will gain experience in molecular biology technique, microbiology, field ecology, genetics, bioinformatics and tissue culture.</p></description>

Potential projects could include studies of mineral weathering, wildfires, and mercury cycling in ecosystems. Students could pursue these interests at the laboratory scale or through field-scale biogeochemistry studies, taking advantage of the Evergreen Ecological Observation Network (EEON), a long-term ecological study area. Students with backgrounds in a combination of geology, biology, or chemistry can gain skills in soil, vegetation, and water collection and learn methods of sample preparation and analysis for major and trace elements.</p></description>

    <title>Undergraduate Research in Scientific Inquiry with D. Bopegedera</title>
    <minimum_credits>0</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>0</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>Rigorous quantitative and qualitative research is an important component of academic learning in Scientific Inquiry. Research opportunities allow science students to work on specific projects associated with faculty members’ expertise. Students typically begin by working in an apprenticeship model with faculty or laboratory staff and gradually take on more independent projects within the context of the specific research program as they gain experience. Students can develop vital skills in research design, data acquisition and interpretation, modeling and theoretical analysis, written and oral communication, collaboration and critical thinking. These are valuable skills for students pursuing a graduate degree or entering the job market.</p><p><strong>Dharshi Bopegedera</strong> (chemistry) would like to engage students in two projects: (1) There is concern that toxic metals are found in unsafe quantities in children’s toys and cosmetics. She would like to engage a student in the quantitative determination of these metals, using the AA and the ICP-MS. Students who are interested in learning to use these instruments and quantitative analysis techniques will find this project interesting. (2) Science and education. With Dharshi, students will work with local teachers to develop lab activities that enhance the science curriculum in local schools. Students with an interest in teaching science who have completed general chemistry with laboratory would be ideal for this project. (3) Dharshi is also interested in looking at chemicals present in e-cigarettes. A student interested in this project could work on the organic or inorganic chemicals.</p></description>

    <maximum_credits>16</maximum_credits>
    <description><p><strong>Note: This program is a repeat of a program offered winter quarter.  Students who took the winter program should not register for the spring repeat.</strong></p><p>Neuroscience continues to be one of the fastest growing areas of biology and is at the cutting edge of technical and conceptual advances in the life sciences. If you want to know how animals (including humans) touch, hear, see, smell, and remember things, then you need to study ions, molecules, cells, neural networks, brain structure and behavior. We will first learn about the function of the brain’s cellular computers: neurons. We will learn how neurons differ from other cells, how they generate electrical signals, and how they communicate with one another via synapses. We will then investigate how neurons cooperate in circuits by studying five sensory systems: vision, touch, hearing, taste and smell. Cellular and molecular mechanisms will be emphasized alongside the physics and mathematics of neurobiology. In the mathematics workshops we will study linear, exponential, and logarithmic functions using a problem-solving approach to college algebra. Collaborative learning will be emphasized. Strong emphasis will be placed on developing students&apos; quantitative skills in order that they be prepared to undertake future scientific programs.</p><p>Our learning goals will include development of analytical and critical thinking, quantitative reasoning, reading, and writing skills. Weekly activities will include lectures, presentations, labs, workshops, and seminars. Students will be required to submit weekly homework assignments, lab and workshop reports, and seminar papers and to contribute actively to the learning community. Students who successfully complete the math portion of the program will receive five credits of Algebraic Thinking for Science and be prepared for precalculus I.</p></description>

    <maximum_credits>0</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>Rigorous quantitative and qualitative research is an important component of academic learning in Scientific Inquiry. Research opportunities allow science students to work on specific projects associated with faculty members’ expertise. Students typically begin by working in an apprenticeship model with faculty or laboratory staff and gradually take on more independent projects within the context of the specific research program as they gain experience. Students can develop vital skills in research design, data acquisition and interpretation, modeling and theoretical analysis, written and oral communication, collaboration and critical thinking. These are valuable skills for students pursuing a graduate degree or entering the job market.</p><p><strong>Donald Morisato</strong> (biology) is interested in the developmental biology of the <em>Drosophila</em> embryo, a model system for analyzing how patterning occurs. Maternally encoded signaling pathways establish the anterior-posterior and dorsal-ventral axes. Individual student projects will use a combination of genetic, molecular biological and biochemical approaches to investigate the spatial regulation of this complex process.</p></description>

There are some opportunities for students to develop cybersecurity games for teaching network security concepts and skills. In robotics, he is looking for students to develop laboratory exercises for several different mobile robotic platforms, including Scribbler, LEGO NXT and iRobot Create. This would also involve writing tools for image processing and computer vision using sequences of still images, video streams and 2.5-D images from the Kinect. In addition, he is open to working with students who have their own ideas for projects in these and related areas, such as machine learning, artificial intelligence, and analysis of processor performance.</p></description>

    <title>"As Real as Rain": The Blues and American Culture</title>
    <minimum_credits>16</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>16</maximum_credits>
    <description><p><em>“The blues is no joke. The blues is real as rain.” –</em>
      David Ritz, music writer
    </p><p>This program will provide an introduction to, and overview of, that magnificent and enduring American art form we know as “the blues”: its musical elements, African and African American roots and precursors, historical and stylistic evolution, major practitioners, and its influence on other musical genres (most notably, jazz, rhythm &amp; blues, rock &amp; roll, rock, and rap/hip hop). Equally importantly, we will examine its impact on American culture and, among other ventures, apply a blues theory of aesthetics to U.S. literature in general, and African American literature in particular.</p><p>
      Our primary written text will be the anthology,
      <em>Write Me a Few of Your Lines: A Blues Reader</em>
      (Steven C. Tracy, editor). Additional written texts will include biographical and autobiographical selections, fiction, poetry (including music lyrics), and scholarly articles on the blues. Weekly film screenings will include a range of fiction works and documentaries such as Martin Scorsese’s critically acclaimed series,
      <em>The Blues: A Musical Journey.</em>
      Finally, there will be extensive listening assignments that will provide the soundtrack for our journey from Africa to the southern United States, to the urban North, throughout our nation, and across the globe.
    </p><p>We will devote two weekly seminars to close readings of written texts, films, and music. In addition to short weekly writing assignments, students will produce a final project that will help them refine both their expository and creative nonfiction writing skills. There will be a weekly open mic opportunity for musicians—whether aspiring or experienced—to play and share the blues, as well as a three-day field trip to a major Pacific Northwest blues festival.</p></description>

    <title>Undergraduate Research in Scientific Inquiry with S. Shulman</title>
    <minimum_credits>0</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>0</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>Rigorous quantitative and qualitative research is an important component of academic learning in Scientific Inquiry. Research opportunities allow science students to work on specific projects associated with faculty members’ expertise. Students typically begin by working in an apprenticeship model with faculty or laboratory staff and gradually take on more independent projects within the context of the specific research program as they gain experience. Students can develop vital skills in research design, data acquisition and interpretation, modeling and theoretical analysis, written and oral communication, collaboration and critical thinking. These are valuable skills for students pursuing a graduate degree or entering the job market.</p><p><strong>Sheryl Shulman</strong> (computer science) is interested in working with advanced computer topics and current problems in the application of computing to the sciences. Her areas of interest include advanced programming languages and compilers, programming language design, programming languages for concurrent and parallel computing, and logic programming.</p></description>

    <title>Even When Erased, We Exist: North American Native Women Standing Strong for Justice</title>
    <minimum_credits>16</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>16</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>
      Native American women have been erased from history. It is not that they did not exist; it is that they were
      <em>made invisible</em>
      , omitted from history. At the same time, stereotypes such as &quot;squaw&quot; and &quot;princess&quot; have plagued Native women since 1492. Ironically, the history of Native women has reflected a different reality with a long tradition of standing strong for justice. Native women have stood to protect the lands and the natural world, their cultures, languages, the health of their families, and Tribal Sovereignty. But few learn about these Native women, who consistently defied the stereotypes in order to work for the betterment of their peoples and nations.
    </p><p>Drawing upon the experiences and writings of such women, we will explore the ways in which leadership is articulated in many Native American communities. We will critique how feminist theory has both served and ignored Native women. Through autobiographies, poetry, short stories, essays, research and films, we will analyze how Native women have argued for sovereignty and developed agendas that privilege community over individuality. We will explore the activism of 20th century Native women leaders, particularly in the areas of the environment, the family system and the law.</p><p>This program will implement decolonizing methodologies to give voice to some of these women, while deconstructing the stereotypes, in order to honor and provide a different way of knowing about these courageous Native American women, past and present. Students will develop skills as writers, researchers and potential allies by studying scholarly and imaginative works and conducting research. Through extensive reading and writing, dialogue, art, films and possible guest speakers, we will investigate important aspects of the life and times of some of these Native American women across the centuries.</p></description>

    <description><p>If you are in or nearing your last year of undergraduate study at Evergreen, this course is an opportunity to develop and refine your writing skills. It will help you polish a portfolio of your written work, including your final academic statement. If you are developing a capstone project, senior thesis, independent research, an internship, or other culminating assignment, these skills will help you improve your final product.</p><p>The aim of the program is to help you become an independent writer capable of both reading and revising your own writing. We will aim for professional competence that will serve you now and beyond Evergreen. Because writing is a social act, you will participate in lively group critiques, complemented by individual conferences in support of your goals. We will integrate assignments with your other academic commitments, including programs, projects, ILCs, courses, and your academic statement.</p></description>

    <minimum_credits>2, 4</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>2, 4</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>If you are in <span>or nearing </span> your last year of undergraduate study at Evergreen, this course is an opportunity to develop and refine your writing skills. It will help you polish a portfolio of your written work, including your final academic statement. If you are developing a capstone project, senior thesis, independent research, an internship, or other culminating assignment, these skills will help you improve your final product.</p><p>The aim of the program is to help you become an independent writer capable of both reading and revising your own writing. We will aim for professional competence that will serve you now and beyond Evergreen. Because writing is a social act, you will participate in lively group critiques, complemented by individual conferences in support of your goals. We will integrate assignments with your other academic commitments, including programs, projects, ILCs, courses, and your academic statement.</p></description>

    <description><p><span>Pre-calculus is problem-solving-based overview of functions that model change.  We will cover a variety of functions (linear, polynomial, exponential, and logarithmic) and represent them algebraically, numerically, graphically, and verbally.  There will be an emphasis on context-based problem solving and collaborative learning. Pre-calculus is designed for students who have an interest in mathematical reasoning and for those who need a more substantial preparation for further study in business, the social sciences, math, or science.  Pre-calculus I along with pre-calculus II (offered Spring 2017) will complete your preparation for Calculus.  You are expected to come into the course with a strong foundation in intermediate algebra (or high school algebra 2 or integrated 3).  </span><span> </span><strong>A graphing calculator is required for the course.</strong></p></description>

    <title>Student-Originated Studies (SOS): Agriculture and Food Systems</title>
    <minimum_credits>16</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>16</maximum_credits>
    <description><p class="Body">Interested in learning more about agriculture? Got an individual project that you’d like to investigate? This Student-Originated Studies (SOS) will support students pursuing individual work in agricultural and food related topics. Such topics may include on-farm internships and/or research projects in agriculture and food related themes. Twelve credits of this SOS will focus on individualized learning goals. The remaining four credits will be earned through common work and a required weekly group meeting to help form a peer support group. This program is ideal for self-motivated students with an interest in agriculture and/or food systems.</p><p class="Body">Students will hold in-program ILC for an internships or research project that will be for 25-30 hours of work per week in scope, and everyone will come together as a class once a week. The common work will include a group meeting one day a week, maintenance of a “field” journal to capture research and internship learning, weekly readings and seminar, group discussion papers, and a final paper and presentation. In the required weekly group meetings, students will explore timely issues relevant to small scale, local, and direct market farming and food topics through discussions and workshops. These issues may include, but are not limited to, winter maintenance of perennial fruit trees and shrubs, vegetative plant propagation, appropriate scale technology, nutrient cycling, water use and law, food production regulations, finances, farm and crop planning and farm business planning, sustainable production practices and other relevant issues decided upon by the class. Students’ individual projects/internships will provide the foundation for exploring relevant farming topics and give a richer and broader basis for discussion.</p><p class="Body">This program is ideal for self-motivated students with an interest in agriculture and/or food systems.</p></description>

    <title>Student-Originated Studies: Commodification Processes and Alternatives</title>
    <minimum_credits>16</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>16</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>“Can we wake up to the earth as something not owned?”  --Beata Tsosie-Pena</p><p>“How long is it since economy discarded the physiocratic illusion, that rents grow out of soil and not out of society? … Value … does not stalk about with a label describing what it is.”  –Karl Marx</p><p>
      How and why does the process of commodification appear to turn everything into objects of economic value?  Should everything--human and non-human--be measurable and exchangeable? What alternatives exist? What alternatives can be created? This SOS will support students to design and then engage with an individual or group project that explores an area of student interest regarding commodification processes and alternatives.  While everything from eating to voting, from learning to (re)producing are possible topics, the commodification of what we all eat will provide a foundation for weekly seminars and a tasting lab.  In addition to reading, writing and discussions on selections from
      <i>The Secret Financial Life of Food:  From Commodities Markets to Supermarkets</i>
      (Newman),
      <i>Racial Indigestion:  Eating Bodies in the 19th Century</i>
      (Tompkins) and
      <i>Chronicles: Stories from the Front Line in the Battle for Environmental Justice</i>
      (LaDuke) weekly sessions will focus on the taste of specific foods and processes of—and alternatives to—the commodification of eating.  Students prepared for 25-30 hours per week of independent work will use an online field journal to document their individual research, apprenticeship, or internship. Options for more structured learning during winter quarter include participation in weekly lectures, films, and workshops in collaboration with Commodities, Conflict, and Cooperation or hands-on learning at the Evergreen organic farm in collaboration with SOS: Agriculture and Food Systems. 
    </p><p>In the spring quarter students will be supported to design and then engage with an individual or group project that explores an area of student interest regarding commodification processes and alternatives including substantive community engagement. Spring quarter students will engage with in-program internships, field studies, or research and service projects to apply their skills and knowledge by focusing on our local Pacific Northwest region or a location of a student&apos;s choice. Students will be guided to complete an in-program Individual Learning Contract regarding their project and to use an online field journal to document their project, including a log of hours, scholarly resources, images, and a weekly post describing their activities and learning. While anything imaginable is a possible topic, the commodification of eating--and alternatives to the commodification of food-- will provide a foundation for a tasting lab and weekly seminar.  Spring quarter options for hands-on learning at the Evergreen organic farm will be determined in consultation with faculty and farm staff.</p><p>Weekly winter and spring program sessions will include circle check-ins regarding student projects. Mid-quarter self-evaluations and final presentations will be required of all students winter and spring quarters.</p><p> </p><p> </p></description>

    <description><p>This full-time, two-quarter program is dance-based, emphasizing student-centered composition and performance. Daily movement activities include 1) Pilates-based conditioning, 2) Nikolais/Louis-based modern dance technique, 3) Laban-based theory/improvisation and analysis, 4) dance composition and critique, including film, text, and movement seminars, and 5) bi-weekly performance forums. Students will learn basic skills of creating and presenting choreography in an open, non-judgmental workshop setting. In winter, we will learn basic methods of generating, developing, and analyzing movement into meaningful compositions. In the spring, we will develop and refine winter work, and identify key areas of student interest through student-directed final projects. Students will organize in cohorts around common interests and develop group project objectives, rehearsal and production schedules toward a studio performance at the end of the quarter.</p><p>
      There are ten basic learning objectives: 1)
      <em>acquire</em>
      experiential knowledge of basic anatomy and principles of kinesiology related to dance technique, 2)
      <em>generate</em>
      and conceptualize artistic ideas and theories of dance, 3)
      <em>organize</em>
      and develop artistic ideas into dance compositions, 4)
      <em>refine</em>
      and complete compositions, 5)
      <em>select,</em>
      analyze, and interpret artistic work for presentation, 6)
      <em>develop</em>
      and refine dance compositions for presentation, 7)
      <em>convey meaning</em>
      through the presentation of artistic work, 8)
      <em>interpret</em>
      intent and meaning in artistic work through critique and discussion, 9)
      <em>synthesize</em>
      and relate knowledge and personal experiences to make dance art, and 10)
      <em>relate</em>
      artistic ideas and works in societal, cultural, and historical context to deepen understanding.
    </p><p>
      Students will learn the basics of dance composition, such as finding and developing a theme, phrasing, organization of performance space, musical time, visual design, and the development of a durable and responsive dance language. We will explore questions such as: What can the body and its parts—hand, eye, heart, hip, knee, etc.—symbolize and express metaphorically? How do we model and explore personal and social relationships in context of solo, small, and large group dance forms? Dance is a visual, as well as a kinetic art. How do
      <em>visual forces</em>
      , such as depth perception, perspective, color, architectural space, etc., coordinate with
      <em>kinetic forces</em>
      such as weight, momentum, inertia, muscular effort, to create cohesive, meaningful, and clearly articulated artistic statements? We will explore ways that movement and dance can
      <em>empower</em>
      and
      <em>liberate</em>
      the individual&apos;s latent creative intelligence, build
      <em>community</em>
      , and promote
      <em>health and well-being</em>
      .
    </p><p>Each week explores a clearly defined artistic premise that fits progressively and recursively into the two-quarter syllabus. Study includes units in correct warm-up, injury prevention and care, trust building and collaborative learning. Text seminars will include methods of working with and against texts and writing about them.</p><p>Please note: Although the program involves exploration of creative insights and blocks, it is aesthetically, not psychologically oriented. All are welcome without exception to engage in a mature, sophisticated inquiry of embodied awareness and control within the broad area of aesthetics; not psychotherapy.</p></description>

    <minimum_credits>4</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>4</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>In this world of information explosion, we are constantly bombarded by numbers. How do you make sense of those numbers? How can you tell which are used correctly and which are not? How can we use statistical tools to inform, to explore and to empower? What are the larger frameworks behind those numbers? How do we use quantitative reasoning to enhance our understanding of the society and make changes? This class will put statistics into context. We will cover basic statistical concepts and processes used in social sciences including descriptive and inferential statistics. Focus will be placed on real life scenarios and sense making practices. Besides workshops, students will conduct a research project and practice statistical analysis. This course meets the statistics prerequisite requirements of the Evergreen Master of Public Administration (MPA) program.</p></description>
