    <title>Emotional Intelligence and Organizational Behavior</title>
    <minimum_credits>16</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>16</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>In this interdisciplinary program, students will learn the fundamentals of organizational psychology, especially organizational behavior. We will focus on factors influencing organizational climate, communication, and ethics from macro (cultural/societal), meso (institutional), and micro (familial) perspectives.</p><p>During the fall quarter, students will explore emotional intelligence and its relationship to successfully working with others in an organization.  People often fall prey to the misconception that only good-looking, fiercely social, or incredibly talented people are likable. Therefore, they mistakenly believe likability is an unteachable trait that comes naturally to only those lucky enough to have it. In reality, being likable is something that is related to emotional intelligence. Students will explore emotional intelligence and its impact on our mental, emotional, and physical health. We will examine the lack of cultural, institutional, and familial support for emotional intelligence throughout socialization and its consequences on our perception; intra- and interpersonal communication; and motivation. Paradigm shifts in thinking (from dichotomous and hierarchical to holistic) and learning (from conceptual to transformative) will be emphasized in order to learn to value both cognitive and emotional intelligence.</p><p>During winter quarter, students will examine the relationship between emotional intelligence and organizational behavior (e.g., conflict resolution, group dynamics, and power struggle) from multiple sources (e.g., theories of personality, cultural diversity, and organization structure and design). Organizational behavior is about how humans behave at work and is an important source of knowledge for a successful employee and manager. When knowledge of organizational behavior is applied, it creates enhanced workplace productivity and satisfaction. In addition, the same organizational behavior knowledge that can enable a manager to excel can also assist individual contributors to an organization in becoming more adaptive and effective employees. Therefore, employees who are not managers may also benefit from insights provided by organizational behavior knowledge.</p><p>Students will be expected to successfully demonstrate appropriate college-level writing, thinking, and oral communication skills and attend every program activity on time with full preparation to participate. Students will be expected to work efficiently for a minimum of 40 hours each week (including class time). Activities will include lectures, seminar discussions, workshops, mindfulness, self-reflection, and integrative academic paper writing. Students should be prepared to explore challenging and unfamiliar ideas that will expand their creative mode of inquiry.</p></description>

    <title>Environmental Problem Solving</title>
    <minimum_credits>16</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>16</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>It is a common misconception in environmentalism that if you can educate people about a problem, they will automatically take steps to solve it. In reality, environmental problem solving is much more complex. It requires a good grasp of the ecological system involved, the structure of government, and public policy as well as the ability to work effectively in groups.</p><p>In this program we will cover basic ecology, political science, economics, and statistics in order to provide students with the necessary background to understand environmental problems. We will look at ecosystem structure, community ecology, population biology, and some of the ways in which human activities impact ecological systems. In the political science component, students will learn about the structure of government at several different levels and the interaction of federal, state, and local government. We will take advantage of the proximity of the state legislature by attending committee meetings and observing the legislative process firsthand. Our focus will be on resource extraction and conservation in the Pacific Northwest, including timber harvest and fisheries, as we develop our toolbox of skills and concepts. Students will be able to explore other environmental issues in assignments and a project in spring quarter.</p><p>In winter quarter we will develop the core concepts in ecology, political science, and economics through lectures, seminars, workshops, and fieldwork and look at the strategies involved in environmental problem solving. Students will have the opportunity to develop skills necessary to work together in groups to solve problems. They will be introduced to some basic psychology in order to understand what they and others bring to these discussions. A series of workshops will introduce students to research design and statistical analysis. Spring quarter will continue to build on these concepts and use case studies and specific examples from the region to provide students with the opportunity to wrestle through the complexity of environmental problems. Students will also explore an environmental issue of their choice in a final project.</p></description>

    <title>The Writing Is Round: A Canon of Words Hurled 'Round the World</title>
    <minimum_credits>16</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>16</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>Through the language of writers from around the world, we can learn of the differences between peoples; the uniqueness of their cultural lives; and their images of what is desirable, what is desired by them, and the conflict between the two. Perhaps we might even learn what is missing from our own cultural view.</p><p>We will be reading authors who have, over the last century, been awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature, including Mo Yan (China), Orhan Pamuk (Turkey), Kenzaburō Ōe (Japan), Naguib Mahfouz (Egypt), Wole Soyinka (Nigeria), Rabindranath Tagore (India), and Nadine Gordimer (South Africa). There will be a focus on the language and the music of the language these writers use to create their thoughts: What is the rhythm of these writers&apos; sentences? How is a sense of time created by them? How does a writer use paragraphs? How are human relationships and desires made manifest in that culture? Was the writing an attempt at criticizing their culture? At maintaining what had been lost from that culture? At giving a voice to those who might otherwise be silent?</p><p>We will be writing our reflections of these writers&apos; work, our contemporary implementations of similar ideas in writing, and our projections of where these writers&apos; imaginations might go and where we might like to take them. So, our writings, including three papers over the 10 weeks of the quarter, will be critical, analytic, and creative.</p></description>

    <description><p>Large software systems have proven to be notoriously difficult to build, modify, and maintain despite the best efforts of many very capable people over the last 50 years. This is an upper-division program intended to help students gain the technical knowledge required to understand, analyze, modify, and build complex software systems.</p><p>We will concentrate on learning the organization and complexity of large software systems that we do understand, and gaining practical experience in order to achieve a deeper understanding of the art, science, collaboration, and multidisciplinary skills required to work on computing solutions in real-world application domains. The technical topics will be selected from data structures, algorithm analysis, operating systems, networks, information security, object-oriented design, and analysis. The program seminar will focus on various technical topics in the software industry. Students will have an opportunity to engage in a substantial computing project through all the development phases: proposal, requirements, specification, design, and implementation.</p><p>This program is for advanced computer science students who satisfy the prerequisites. We also expect students to have the discipline, intellectual maturity, and self-motivation to complete homework at an advanced level, identify project topics, organize project teams and resources, and complete advanced project work independently.</p></description>

    <title>Books and Silences: Samuel Beckett and Book Arts</title>
    <minimum_credits>16</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>16</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>In this program we’ll study the work of Samuel Beckett, one of the most influential and acclaimed writers of the 20th century. Our study will blend careful textual study with literary criticism and philosophy to allow us access to a variety of readings from Beckett&apos;s difficult oeuvre. Because Beckett&apos;s writing invites us to consider the limits of literature and language, it provides a unique lens with which to explore the art of the book as the &quot;organism that literature demands&quot; (to quote Mallarmé). Through a practical and philosophical encounter with book arts, we&apos;ll develop ways of thinking about the book form and about the arts of reading and writing. Studio work will emphasize basic letterpress printing, basic bookbinding, and experimental book arts practices. Student work will include short essays, creative writing, and individual experiments with the book as an expressive and practical form. This program entails a lot of reading and a lot of studio time, including the purchase of numerous texts and art materials in order to complete required projects. This program is suitable for students with prior experience in literary studies who want to delve into difficult readings and who are interested in an introduction to new artistic practices.</p></description>

    <title>Face of the Other: Levinas, Postmodern Ethics, and Jewish Thought</title>
    <minimum_credits>16</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>16</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>This program will explore Emmanuel Levinas’ compelling ethics of responsibility for the other. Levinas forged his understanding in reaction to the Holocaust of World War II, critiquing the moral limitations of Western philosophy while finding an imperative for human conduct that is “pre-philosophy.” He locates the origins of ethical meaning in the face-to-face encounter: the experience of being called by, and responding to, another. For Levinas, responsibility to other persons is unlimited—and its realization, through acts of recognition, hospitality, fellowship, and justice, is the means of transcendence in human existence.   </p><p>This inquiry is for students who seek foundations for ethical action via philosophy, religion, politics, psychology, education, literature, and the arts—fields that are challenged and inspired by the implications of Levinas’ work. We will look closely at Levinas’ connection to Judaism, in particular his rich readings of the Talmud, which root his search for the universal values necessary to pursue ideals like justice and truth in ancient Jewish narratives, and, by implication, narratives of other religious/spiritual traditions. We will study Levinas’ philosophical writings, trace how he developed his worldview over the course of his career, and consider work by thinkers who influenced him and whom he has influenced.</p><p>The program will involve intensive reading, dialogue, and writing, with seminars, lectures, workshops, and guest speakers. Students will share responses in brief papers, journal entries, and oral presentations. They will undertake an individual exploration (their major piece of writing) to investigate, apply, or otherwise creatively engage with Levinas’ vision in relation to a topic that matters to them. We will fashion our own stories and models to engage contemporary cultural, political, and intellectual debates about what it means to lead an ethical life.</p></description>

    <title>The Making of Global Capitalism, 1500&ndash;1914</title>
    <minimum_credits>16</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>16</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>Working together primarily in a seminar format, students and faculty will establish a historical, theoretical, and analytical understanding of the birth of capitalism in the crisis of 16th-century European feudalism, its rise and consolidation in the late 18th and 19th centuries, the development of the global political economy, and its first systemic crisis accompanied by a major burst of imperial expansion in the late 19th century. We will find this topic to be steeped in controversy.  </p><p>Capitalism has transformed the world materially, socially, and ecologically. We will consider the interrelationships among these three categories as capitalism developed and changed through its formative period. Major analytical categories will be imperialism, colonialism, and globalism, the accompanying ecological transformations, and the rise of social classes in resistance to these developments. We will study the rise of liberalism in its historical context, as well as its counterparts, conservatism and socialism. Understanding the trajectory, deep history, and logic of historical capitalism will provide students the insights and tools necessary to assess the current historical moment. The program will require close and careful reading and discussion, as well as considered and well-grounded writing. Our work will be conducted at an upper-division level, so students should have significant experience in close analytical reading, critical thinking, and research writing.</p></description>

    <title>Maritime Cultures of Northwest Washington</title>
    <minimum_credits>16</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>16</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>The relationship between the maritime cultures of northwest Washington and the marine environment evolves continuously. Through arts and literature as well as nonfiction narratives, we will study the histories, identities, economies, and challenges of lives defined and dependent upon our regional inland waters, the Salish Sea. We will visit several indigenous and nonindigenous maritime communities, people at the forefront of both the exploitation and the defense of the waters, and those who are often the first to feel the effects of the destruction of the marine habitat and resources. We will participate in a weeklong field trip in the San Juan Islands area, voyaging by canoe and traditional sailing ship. In each visit and in our readings and writing we will explore how regional maritime communities understand their relationship and responsibility to the Salish Sea. Our personal and collective connections to the Salish Sea and marine environments will be explored through an environment-centered art project, the study of native art and its environmental symbolism, and the analysis of literary works.</p></description>

    <description><p>This program will allow students to develop an understanding of the relationship between business and biology, particularly how natural resources are used for business. We will explore how business practices and biological technology shape, impact, and are influenced by natural resource limitations and policies. Our emphasis will be on the Western United States, with a particular focus on how watershed resources are utilized directly or indirectly for business. The program includes fundamental work in entrepreneurship, ecotourism, sustainability, energy, water use, and biology.</p><p>In the winter quarter students will participate in a two-week field trip to observe firsthand how natural resources—particularly energy and water—are used in industry. During this trip we will explore nature and its interface with industries including agriculture, viticulture, and ecotourism in order to develop an appreciation for how we impact, conserve, and sustain our precious natural resources. We plan to visit both small and large businesses so that students have an opportunity to explore the different challenges and opportunities presented at these different scales.</p><p>Students leaving this program will be better equipped to understand how a successful business operates, and how to work within the constraints imposed by competition, government, and limited natural resources. In addition, students will gain an understanding about sustainable alternatives to existing infrastructure.</p></description>

    <title>The Nature and Culture of Natural History</title>
    <minimum_credits>16</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>16</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>This learning community focuses on the natural history of the Puget Sound region with an emphasis on the 1,000-acre wooded campus of Evergreen. Students will examine environmental gradients and learn how climate, geology, and other factors affect plant life. To apply these concepts, students will learn to read a variety of landscapes and analyze vegetation, including lowland coniferous forests, prairies, oak woodlands, riparian woodlands, and marshes. Students will gain an ability to recognize the common plants of the Pacific Northwest. In addition to studying fresh plant material, students will also study herbarium specimens. Plant-identification skills to be developed include learning how to identify deciduous shrubs and trees in winter based on twig characteristics. Students will maintain a detailed natural history journal for six months and study 18th- and 19th-century natural history journals as models. In support of this work, students will learn basic illustration skills to sketch our observations in the field and the laboratory.</p><p>In addition to practicing the art and science of natural history, students will examine the cultural history of natural history. In fall, we will explore the rise of natural history including its European antecedents. We will also focus on the history and philosophy of science as it pertains to the biological sciences. The learning community will pay special attention to placing the scientific revolution and the rise of plant science in a historical context. In winter, students will explore how natural historians and botanists have contributed in the past to white settlement in the Puget Sound region. We will consider how we, as practitioners, can contribute to more egalitarian and sustainable relations with the natural world in our region in ways that take the legacy of American expansion and the rise of the white republic seriously. With the aid of weekly workshops, students will improve their ability to write thesis-driven essays defended with evidence from the assigned texts in cultural studies.</p></description>

    <title>Survival of Indigenous Art</title>
    <minimum_credits>12, 16</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>12, 16</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>How do indigenous people and their culture survive genocide? What did indigenous people choose to save when facing a holocaust? When the reality of ethnic cleansing is upon you as indigenous people, how do you secure the survival of your culture? In the 21st century, what are the elements of colonization and assimilation that continue to eliminate indigenous people and their culture? We will look at trends in laws; policy; and lived experiences of indigenous people in North American, the Ainu of Japan, the Quechua of Peru; as well as the ability of indigenous people to survive. Elements of indigenous art will be studied in terms of the history and culture of regions, intellectual property, gender norms, and visual sovereignty contrasted with intellectual and political sovereignty. Students will learn about the different ways indigenous communities have employed images and objects as links to history, identity, culture, function, and ceremony. Students will learn about the language of oppression as foundational information for understanding how the impacts of historical events still reverberate in marginalized communities today.</p><p>Art, art theory, and the making of art will be predominant during our program studies. We will work with textiles, basketry, and paper. Students will learn to create both hand-drawn and computer-generated stencils for use with photo-emulsion printing techniques. Students will create a conceptual body of work with an emphasis on professional editioning practices. Students will experience firsthand the therapeutic value of cultural art practices. Students will learn about reclaiming steps Tribes have taken to awaken and use sustaining practices that had been taken away in a civilizing effort by the United States and their allies.</p><p>We welcome students who do not identify as artists but have a deep interest in working with indigenous communities. The program will work toward developing different forms of literacies, including visual, cultural, and political. Lectures, films, readings, and student-led text-based seminars will compose the primary structures used by our learning community. Quarterly, students will complete an academic project related to the theme of the program and work in groups to prepare an arts activity for Generations Rising: Tribal Youth/Make Art day. Students will engage in service learning volunteer projects with Tribes preparing for the yearly paddle journeys. Participation in this program means practicing accountability to the learning community and other communities, as well as interacting as a respectful guest with other cultures and engaging in constant communication with co-learners.</p></description>

    <description><p>Sight and sound are often thought of as registers that sustain and represent what escapes language. Language in turn is often thought of as constituted by its exclusion of embodied experience. A parallel thought is inscribed into the division between our familiar, material, analog world and the virtual realm of the digital. What we can and do share with others is shaped by our participation in figurative, sonic, and/or linguistic systems. We will take up, complicate, and challenge these claims both creatively and theoretically in this program in experimental sound and visual art, critical theory, and psychoanalytic theory.</p><p>In addition to analyzing contemporary examples of sound art and visual work, we will have a broad range of interlocutors in poetry, literary theory, psychoanalysis, philosophy, and critical theory. These will likely range from Freud to Lacan, Kristeva, and Žižek in psychoanalytic theory; and from Hegel and Marx to Adorno, Michel Chion, Laura Mulvey, Kaja Silverman, and Sianne Ngai in critical theory and aesthetics.</p><p>We will engage these challenging interlocutors in seminars, small groups, lectures, and reading sessions; and students will produce regular academic writing. Our work will also include substantial art, writing, and studio components, with introductory technology workshops in audio and visual production. Over both quarters, students will write regular academic essays, engage in creative-writing workshops, and develop a sustained studio practice. In the fall, each student will produce a collection of experiments in audio production and a companion essay. With the help of additional visual production training, the fall experiments will serve as ground and source for the major audio-visual winter project. The program will conclude with a public screening and launch party for these projects.</p></description>

    <title>Andean Roots: Linguistics and Ecological Agriculture in Peru</title>
    <minimum_credits>16</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>16</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>The program will use linguistics and ecological agriculture as primary lenses for understanding cultural ecology, history, geography, and sustainability studies in the Andean region of Peru. All enrolled students will be in Peru for the entire quarter. Study in Peru will be centered in the highlands of Cusco. However, students will get to know people and cultural landscapes spanning the temperate valleys near Machu Picchu, high-altitude agricultural communities, and beyond to Lake Titicaca. As the former Incan capital, and home to vibrant cultures and immense agricultural diversity, the Cusco region of Peru offers immersion in the study of biocultural diversity and how the preservation of linguistic diversity is related to the preservation of traditional ecological knowledge, biodiversity, and local food systems. We will ask how knowledge is transferred across generations and between communities, and how traditional lifeways can be supported in the face of development pressure.</p><p>Learning activities in Peru will be a combination of group travel, Spanish or Quechua language study, community immersion, rural and urban homestays, and faculty-led field research projects to gain depth in linguistics and/or agroecology and agricultural biodiversity. Experiencing life in agrarian communities and participating in community-based projects to preserve cultural landscapes and indigenous knowledge systems will give context to our analysis of development pressure and societal shifts in language and agricultural practices.</p></description>

    <title>Unpacking Counter Narratives: Examining Multiple Perspectives and Diverse Voices</title>
    <minimum_credits>16</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>16</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>How can we create different forms of education, knowledge, and literacy through storytelling, oral history, multimedia, and popular culture in order to provide a space for marginalized voices to be heard? To address this question, this program will examine how counter-narrative and qualitative research offer a framework for diverse voices to share, research, and create unique, personal, and contextualized multicultural learning experiences. By engaging in the study of education, literature, storytelling, and multimedia, we will explore the lives and experiences of people from different cultures, times, and places. The study of counter-narratives will also help us make meaning of our daily encounters, language, intersectionality, and strategies for community-building. As a pedagogical framework, the examination of counter-narratives will help us expand our understanding of teaching, learning, and language. A major objective of our study of counter-narratives is for students to expand their understanding of research from multiple perspectives and generate new frameworks for cross-cultural education.</p><p>In this unique and collaborative program between two institutions of higher education, Evergreen and Daejeon University in Korea, together we will investigate how to conduct oral-history research, storytelling, and learning in a diverse learning community. In addition, this program will serve as an opportunity to support students developing more complex language, literacy, qualitative research, and ESL skills through cooperative and collaborative learning. Students will take an active role in working together through community-based activities, peer mentoring, and local field trips.</p></description>

    <description><p>This program is intended to help students fulfill general biology requirements necessary for advanced work in environmental studies and the natural sciences. Throughout the two quarters, we will emphasize evolution as the framework that links the biological sciences across scales—from individual cells, to multi-cellular organisms, up to populations and communities of interacting organisms within ecosystems. The selective interface of ecology will be the lens through which we understand evolutionary processes and patterns.</p><p>In fall quarter, we will explore the diversity of life, how plants and animals work, and the evolutionary processes that have led to current patterns of species distributions. We will explore the origins of life on earth, and the evolution of various branches on the tree of life across geologic time scales. We will incorporate Pacific Northwest natural history to deepen our understanding of evolutionary relationships and focus on the process of science in biology, with a particular emphasis on experimental design, data collection, and statistical analysis.</p><p>In winter quarter, we will gain a deeper understanding of cellular and molecular biology, genetics and genomics, biomolecules (lipids, carbohydrates, proteins, and nucleic acids), basic thermodynamics, energetics, metabolic processes, cellular respiration, and photosynthesis. We will strengthen our understanding of evolution throughout the quarter by applying cellular and molecular biology concepts to the principles of ecology. We will continue our application of quantitative and statistical methodologies as a tool for understanding scientific information.</p></description>

    <title>Shakespeare and Brecht</title>
    <minimum_credits>12, 16</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>12, 16</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>In 16th-century London, William Shakespeare was commercially successful, but only one of a sea of talented dramatists. Since then, he has become the most recognizable emblem of English-speaking culture. He is both an icon of elite knowledge and widely accessible through a continual process of adaptation and appropriation. Bertolt Brecht was a German playwright working in the tumultuous period between the two World Wars. He was widely admired during his lifetime as a theatrical innovator, but is now little known to the casual theater-goer. Despite their different cultural status in 21st-century America, these playwrights share some crucial stylistic commonalities. Brecht read Shakespeare voraciously and took him as a model for how theater can expose fundamental political and social rifts. Brecht also adopted Elizabethan theater, along with Chinese theater, as a source of inspiration for his own style of anti-naturalistic acting.</p><p>In this program we will read plays by both authors and study theories of acting, allowing students to test out modes of interpretation as both readers and performers. Skill-building workshops will help students understand the play scripts by reading them out loud and performing them for each other. In particular, students will learn to analyze and scan Shakespeare’s verse structures. Students new to this kind of voice training for actors will learn beginning levels of vocal resonance, projection, and diction. Students with some previous experience will be able to apply these skills to emotional interpretation of poems and plays.</p><p>No previous experience with theater is necessary to succeed in this program, only the willingness to try new ways of inhabiting the text. Students who enroll for 16 credits will participate in an additional text-based Shakespeare seminar.</p></description>

    <title>Financial Heartland</title>
    <minimum_credits>16</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>16</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>This program is a historical tour of the forces that molded and shaped the financial centers of three U.S. cities that are now mutual fund, commodity, and capital-raising hubs: New York, Boston, and Chicago. This program is designed for students with a strong interest in finance, business, and history. Although this program is designed as a broad introduction to the three areas of focus—mutual funds, commodities, and capital raising—there are opportunities for students to explore subject matter within these areas in more depth.</p><p>The first part of the quarter will cover the history of the three cities and explore how they came to be financial centers. We will then move on to a discussion of the evolution of mutual funds, commodities, and the capital-raising process. Students will work in groups to research the history of a particular business in one of the financial center cities and present their findings at the end of the quarter, linking this work with their visits to a financial heartland city. There will be a large emphasis on writing, including brief and very focused assignments, as well as seminar papers.</p><p>Students will have the option to travel to one of the U.S. financial center cities for a week of research. These trips may have a faculty member present for a portion of the visit but are for the most part independent and student organized. The goal of these trips is to explore the financial expertise for which each of these cities is known, while also looking at how the wealth created by financial businesses has shaped these cities. Visits are expected to include meetings with various business leaders and trips to local museums and other cultural sites. Students unable to travel to the financial heartland cities will conduct a similar type of analysis on three cities in Washington state, looking at the role finance played in their growth and evolution.</p><p> </p></description>

    <title>With Liberty and Justice for Whom?</title>
    <minimum_credits>16</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>16</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>The faculty and students will embark upon a thorough study of the origins and current status of justice in American society. Drawing from an interdisciplinary perspective, we will consider various definitions and theories of justice, review the way justice is carried out in different settings and historical periods, and examine the possibility of achieving truly just social institutions. Topics to be considered include social and environmental justice, just political and economic systems, criminal justice, just healthcare and educational access, representations of justice in media, as well as concepts of equity, fairness, and equality. By the end of the academic year, we will be able to offer concrete recommendations as to the steps necessary to achieve justice for all in our society.</p><p>The theme for fall quarter is <em>identifying the problem and clarifying the question</em>. The first quarter of the program will be used to lay the foundation for the rest of the year, both substantively and in terms of the tools necessary to operate effectively in the learning community. We will explore the concept of justice as it is explicated in theory, history, and practice. The concept will be analyzed from both the perspectives of legal system and moral teachings. In seminars, we will read and analyze texts dealing with issues that have historically raised questions of whether justice was achieved. Students will examine their personal experience with justice issues by constructing an autobiographical memoir. Our work will be supplemented with a series of courses designed to assure literacy with words, numbers, and images. Students will have the opportunity to hone their skills in critical reasoning, research, and the use of multimedia and computers.</p><p>Winter quarter&apos;s theme is <em>researching roots, causes, and potential solutions</em>. We will look at specific contemporary societal issues in justice viewed from a variety of institutional perspectives, most notably justice in education, health care, law, science, government, and politics. Students will investigate specific justice issues of interest with the purpose of identifying a particular problem, defining its dimensions, determining its causes, and establishing action plans for its remedy.</p><p>In the spring, the theme will progress to <em>implementation.</em> The final quarter of the program will be devoted to the design and implementation of projects aimed at addressing the issues of injustice identified in the winter quarter. Seminar groups will combine their efforts to undertake actual programs aimed at assisting the community in righting a current injustice or providing greater justice for the community. The projects may take the form of educational events, publications, multimedia presentations, or art installations to help the community find higher levels of justice. Courses will assist in the successful implementation and evaluation of student group activities.</p></description>

    <title>Chekhov, Stanislavski, and Modern Drama</title>
    <minimum_credits>12</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>12</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>This program will explore the works of the Russian short fiction writer and playwright Anton Chekhov and other European dramatists, such as Henrik Ibsen, who together are credited with the development of modern drama. We will analyze not only their fictional and dramatic works but also their lives and times—from which they drew their characters and dramatic situations.</p><p>Chekhov’s drama, subtle and mundane yet profound, led Constantin Stanislavski to invent an entirely new system of acting in order to interpret them, and has linked them inextricably.  Modern actors’ concern with emotional authenticity originated with Chekhov and Stanislavski. In fall quarter, all students will be trained in the fundamentals of acting, voice, directing, and design.  Students will apply those skills to stage scenes from Chekhov’s <i>Three Sisters.</i></p><p>In winter quarter, the entire class will become a production company to stage <i>Three Sisters </i>for the public.  In addition to acting, students can expect to be involved in all aspects of technical theatre.  They will help create costumes, scenery, lighting, and sound; work backstage during performances; create and carry out publicity plans for the production; and serve as stage managers and house managers. Most major acting roles will be reserved for those who enroll in the program for both fall and winter quarters.</p><p>Also in winter quarter, we will study plays by Ibsen, Shaw, Brecht, and other dramatists associated with the birth of modern drama. Throughout the program we will read, critique, and discuss commentaries—current and past—on the plays of Chekhov and the other late-19th and 20th century dramatists, and explore the many explanations given for their enduring legacy and influence.</p></description>

    <title>Liberty, Equality, Authority: Modern Political Philosophy</title>
    <minimum_credits>8</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>8</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>We hold up equality and liberty as high ideals in our society. Yet we see inequality and restrictions on liberty wherever we look. How did we get here? What can we do about it?</p><p>In this program, we will study the origins of the ideals of individual liberty and equality in political philosophy, beginning in the 17th century and moving up to the present day. We will study the questions that arise from these ideals: By what right does any government have power over people? What could constitute legitimate political authority? What order of society best lives up to these ideals? We will read classics of modern political philosophy by Hobbes, Locke, Rousseau, Marx, and Mill, as well as some contemporary sources that extend and challenge the views of earlier thinkers. Students will also engage in research into contemporary political issues in connection with a political theory we study. Credit will be awarded in political philosophy.</p></description>

    <title>Slavic and Celtic Folklore: Heroic, Spiritual, Practical</title>
    <minimum_credits>16</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>16</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>This program will explore the folklore of the Slavic and Celtic peoples from earlier times to the present in a cross-cultural study of two of Eurasia&apos;s oldest ethnic groups. Both groups are dispersed: the Slavic regions across eastern and southeastern Europe and into Eurasia, and the Celtic regions across the islands and peninsulas of the West. Both are renowned for their abundant folklore traditions, which have deep roots in a remote past and have served as a valuable source of inspiration for writers, composers, and dramatists from the 19th century to the present. What characteristics do both traditions share? What distinguishes the two cultural traditions? What essential historical, linguistic, and spiritual elements permeate the hearts and minds of local people in these regions? What do their folklore practices reveal?</p><p>We begin the quarter with regional epic narratives and explore the histories and belief systems of the two regions. We follow this foundational work with an exploration of folklore practices (customs, rituals, beliefs), examine 19th-century cultural nationalist movements in music and literature, and conclude with how it all plays out in contemporary life, both rural and urban. This program may serve as a springboard for further study of the Celtic and Slavic peoples, of folklore, and of the material elements of culture.</p><p>Each week includes lectures, films, seminars, and possible workshops, collaborative presentations, and guest performers or presenters. Students will be expected to write short essays, as requested, and to complete a significant essay at the end of the quarter that examines the role, use, and appropriation of folklore materials in a particular Slavic or Celtic region.</p></description>

    <minimum_credits>16</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>16</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>This Student-Originated Studies (SOS) program is an opportunity for students to do intermediate to advanced work in the social sciences and history, especially topics in diversity, multiculturalism, and social justice. Students will work in small groups or independently on in-depth projects or areas of study and may include an internship component if the student has already researched and started the process to get approval from an outside agency with an identified supervisor. The format of this program includes weekly meetings to discuss particular assignments and updates on student work. Each student will engage in weekly academic writing assignments based on the individual student&apos;s self-determined reading list, with technical assistance from the faculty.</p><p>Students should anticipate meetings Weeks 1–4 and 6–9 with their peers and faculty to report on their studies and to receive critical feedback and recommendations for further study. Students will need to be available for individual conferences with the faculty during Weeks 5 and 10. Students will upload assignments on a weekly basis that indicate academic progress toward a final project. The final project must be uploaded during Week 10. Prior to their final evaluation conference with the faculty, students must upload a self-evaluation of their learning.</p><p>An in-program internship is possible if (1) it is related to the theme of this student-originated studies program, (2) the student has already researched and started the process to get approval from an outside agency with an identified supervisor, and (3) an academic component is included (see above). Students pursuing this option must complete an in-program internship learning contract in consultation with the faculty and Academic Advising.</p></description>

    <title>Inside Language</title>
    <minimum_credits>16</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>16</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>This program explores the fascinating world of languages. What do you know when you know a language? How do you acquire that knowledge? Are there properties that all languages share? How do languages change over time? Why are half of the world&apos;s languages now under threat of extinction? How are communities held together or torn apart by the languages they speak?</p><p>We will consider these questions and others through the lens of linguistics, which is the study of how languages are structured, how they are used in social interaction, and how they change over time. Topics to be examined for fall include phonetics, phonology, morphology, language change, the history of English and its dialects, key issues facing multilingual communities, and language planning. In winter, topics will include syntax, semantics, pragmatics, first language acquisition, language and gender, and linguistic politeness. We will look at well-known languages and lesser-known languages and discover why they matter in our lives today. Throughout the program, students will learn a variety of conceptual and empirical techniques, from analyzing speech sounds to interpreting the rationale behind current language policy.</p><p>This program will be an intensive examination of language-related topics. In class, students will participate in lectures, workshops, seminars, labs, and films. Outside of class, students should be prepared to do a significant amount of reading, as well as regular problem sets and essays.</p></description>

    <description><p>This program focuses on the examination of cultural understandings, assumptions, and representations made by Western writers and artists as they adopted elements of Japanese aesthetics through Japonism, especially the Japanese influence on European impressionism. Lectures, workshops, readings, and films will feature an array of Western works with Japanese themes. In turn, the curriculum will examine aspects of Japanese culture and arts that are influenced by Western aesthetics. Such cultural-crossing concerns will be examined further through a series of student group research projects. Students interested in this program must be prepared to read extensively and express their growing understanding through essay writing and works of visual representation, such as collage and assemblage.</p><p>
      Curriculum materials will offer visual and literary examples of Japanese-Western cultural crossing. Readings that demonstrate how Western writers interpret Japanese society will include 
      <em>The Lady and the Monk</em>
      (Pico Iyer);
      <em>Zen in the Art of Archery</em>
      (Eugen Herrigel);
      <em>Crossing State Lines: An American Renga</em>
      (Carol Muske-Dukes and Bob Holman, editors);
      <em>The Chrysanthè</em><em>me Papers</em>
      (Christopher Reed); and 
      <em>Lafcadio Hearn&apos;s Japan: An Anthology of His Writings on the Country and Its People</em>
      (Donald Ritchie, editor). Japanese literature that expresses westernization will include
      <em>Botchan</em>
      (Sōseki Natsume) and
      <em>Colorless Tsukuru Tazaki and His Years of Pilgrimage</em>
      (Murakami Haruki). Films such as
      <em>The Hedgehog</em>
      (Mona Achache, 2009),
      <em>Enlightenment Guaranteed</em>
      (Doris Dörrie, 2002),
      <em>The Death of the Hired Man</em>
       (Noh), and
      <em>Cherry Blossoms</em>
      (Doris Dörrie, 2008) exemplify the use of elements of Japanese aesthetics, while
      <em>Kwaidan</em>
      (Kobayashi Masaki, 1964),
      <em>Twenty-Four Eyes</em>
      (Keisuke Kinoshita, 1954),
      <em>Leonie</em>
      (Hisako Matsui, 2010) and
      <em>All About Our House</em>
       (Kōki Mitani, 2001) will be screened to observe Western aesthetic influences.

    <title>Political Economy of "Race" in the U.S.: Colonial Era to the Present</title>
    <minimum_credits>16</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>16</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>Despite claims that the U.S. is &quot;post-racial,&quot; why does &quot;race,&quot; nevertheless continue to retain significance in our contemporary era? And more specifically, just what is &quot;race?&quot;</p><p>To address these question and others, this program explores the origins and manifestations of the contested concept of race, including the role of the U.S. judicial system and law enforcement. We will further investigate the ways in which one&apos;s racial identification can result in differential social, economic, and political treatment and how social movements emerged to challenge racial inequality. To understand these phenomena, we will analyze the racialized history of the United States in relation to dominant discourses of popular culture, science, psychology, health care, law, citizenship, education, and personal/public identity.</p><p>Central to this program is a study of historical connections between European colonialism prior to U.S. independence as a nation and the expansion of U.S. political and military dominance globally since independence and into the 21st century. Students will examine related contemporary concepts such as racism, prejudice, discrimination, gender, class, affirmative action, white privilege, and color blindness. Students will consider current research and racialized commentaries that surround debates on genetics vs. culture (i.e., nature vs. nurture).</p><p>Students will learn to recognize contemporary expressions of race by what we hear, see, and read, as well as absences and silences that we find through readings, dialogue in seminars, films, and academic writing. We will work together to make sense of these expressions and link them to their historical origins. Students will also have an opportunity to examine the social formation of their own racial identities through their own personal narratives. Current approaches from social psychology will be foundational in this aspect of the program. Related to this is consideration as to what it can mean to be an anti-racist in a 21st-century racialized society.</p></description>

    <title>Mathematical Systems</title>
    <minimum_credits>16</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>16</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>This program is built around intensive study of several fundamental areas of pure mathematics. Covered topics are likely to include abstract algebra, real analysis, set theory, combinatorics, and probability.</p><p>The work in this advanced-level mathematics program is quite likely to differ from students&apos; previous work in mathematics, including calculus, in a number of ways. We will emphasize the careful understanding of the definitions of mathematical terms and the statements and proofs of the theorems that capture the main conceptual landmarks in the areas we study. Hence, the largest portion of our work will involve the reading and writing of rigorous proofs in axiomatic systems. These skills are valuable not only for continued study of mathematics but also in many areas of thought in which arguments are set forth according to strict criteria for logical deduction. Students will gain experience in articulating their evidence for claims and in expressing their ideas with precise and transparent reasoning.</p><p>In addition to work in core areas of advanced mathematics, we will devote seminar time to looking at our studies in a broader historical, philosophical, and cultural context, working toward answers to such critical questions as: Are mathematical systems discovered or created? Do mathematical objects actually exist? How did the current mode of mathematical thinking come to be developed? What is current mathematical practice? What are the connections between mathematics and culture? What are the connections between mathematics and literature?</p><p>This program is designed for students who intend to pursue graduate studies or teach in mathematics and the sciences, as well as for those who want to know more about mathematical thinking.</p></description>

    <description><p>The relationship between nature and history is complex, so much so that the space between nature and the human, being and language, may not even be measurable. Yet the environmental imperatives of our moment—including the need to cultivate a tolerance if not an appreciation for complexity itself—are the decisive ones. In this program, we will think through questions of environmental consciousness and its discontents from the points of view of political ecology, gastropoetics, eco-poetics, and eco-music. How does immersion in complex music prepare us to recognize the complexities of an ecosystem? Does the deliciousness of a fine organic, single origin chocolate correspond to the tropical ecosystem of the country of origin, the evolutionary development of mammalian taste receptors, or the cultivated aesthetic of the chocolatier? Is the poem mimetic of nature, or a function of it? How could such a seemingly noble enterprise as &apos;environmentalism&apos; or &apos;protecting nature&apos; be problematic? How have powerful environmental imaginaries and narratives served to dangerously simplify how environmental problems and their solutions are conceptualized?</p><p>These are some of the analytical, political, philosophical, aesthetic, and compositional questions posed in this program. Ours will be a multifaculty, multidisciplinary approach to interdisciplinary community-based learning. While activities will include shared lectures and readings, half of program work will take place in faculty-specific tracks. Students organized in small groups with representation from each track will meet regularly to integrate program materials and create performances of that which does not fit the measure.</p><p><strong>Eco-poetics</strong> with Leonard Schwartz explores creative and critical approaches to language, with a view to reframing our understanding of the relationship between nature and history. This track is recommended for students seeking to explore experimental possibilities in writing.</p><p>The <strong>political ecology</strong> track with Shangrila Joshi Wynn focuses on critical analyses of dominant environmental narratives through a lens of social difference. Our goal will be understanding how prevailing environmental discourses are shaped by colonialism and other contemporary configurations of power and privilege along lines of race, class, gender, and North-South difference.</p><p><strong>Gastropoetics</strong> (stomach + making) with Sarah Williams will explore the historically complex relationship between belly and mind. Although the capacity for sensual pleasure to overwhelm communicative value has been considered a crime in various times and places, we&apos;ll deliberately explore with Cézanne how the taste of a mere carrot, well savored through mouth <em>and</em> pen, could start a revolution.</p><p><strong>Eco-music</strong> with Andrea Gullickson will examine the intricate patterns, both textual and performative, that make up music, with consideration of how deepening our understanding of the interconnectedness of these patterns might impact the ways we think about and interact with the environment in which we live.</p><p> </p></description>

    <title>Creative Oceans</title>
    <minimum_credits>16</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>16</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>This program will examine life in Earth&apos;s oceans and use the ocean and its inhabitants as sources of inspiration for creative writing. Our goal is to build a solid understanding of marine biology and develop our abilities to write in styles appropriate to several creative genres, including short stories, nonfiction, poetry, and other literary forms. We will also learn to write in a correct scientific style. Our marine studies will focus on the organisms that live in the ocean and their ecological interactions. The ocean has inspired a diverse group of authors to compose creative pieces, and seminars will explore these works across a wide variety of genres and diverse marine ecosystems. These include works by Joseph Conrad, Yukio Mishima, Pablo Neruda, and Sheri Tepper, among others. Laboratory work will introduce students to skills needed to carry out studies in marine biology. We will conduct various field studies in Puget Sound, and there will be a weeklong field trip to the coast of the Olympic Peninsula to observe marine organisms in their natural habitat and to take advantage of opportunities for reflective creative work. Through weekly workshops, students will hone their abilities to write creatively and analyze quantitative data. Students will be evaluated on the basis of their writing assignments, exams, quizzes, laboratory exercises, and notebooks, as well as their participation in seminars and workshops.</p></description>

    <title>Reason: Science and Religion</title>
    <minimum_credits>16</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>16</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>In this program, we will explore the concept of reason as articulated by the belief systems of science and religion. Many people think there are irreconcilable disagreements between the teachings of religions and the teachings of modern science. For example, how should we think about the claims of evolutionary theory, fundamentalist religious movements, and the so-called New Atheist movement? We will inquire as to whether there are rational principles that can adjudicate these competing claims. How do nonrational social and cultural forces shape modern science? Can religion be rational? Can science be irrational? Students will develop foundational knowledge in philosophy, religious studies, science, and society through lecture, seminar, and workshops.</p></description>

    <title>Greece and Italy: An Artistic and Literary Odyssey</title>
    <minimum_credits>16</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>16</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>Classical Greece and Renaissance Italy made among the Western world&apos;s most extraordinary contributions to the written word and the visual arts. These accomplishments continue to captivate artists and thinkers, giving them models and standards to admire, emulate, struggle against, or reject—but rarely to ignore. We will study the texts and monuments of ancient Greece, from the Bronze Age to the Roman period, and Italy, especially Florence, from the 13th through the 16th centuries. We will read authors including Homer, Sappho, Aeschylus, Dante, and Petrarch; artists we study will include Pheidias, Praxiteles, Giotto, and Michelangelo. Throughout the program, we will also learn about modern rediscoveries and reinterpretations of these periods, culminating in our own journey to Greece and Italy.</p><p>In fall, we will investigate the rise of the Greek polis, or city-state, from the ashes of the Minoan and Mycenaean civilizations, as well as that of the Etruscans in what is now Tuscany. <span>In addition to reading primary source materials, we will study the surviving architecture, sculpture, painting, and pottery. </span>Students will have the option of studying ancient Greek language, learning drawing, or learning photography. In winter, our focus will be on the Roman appropriation of Greek art and thought and the later Florentine rediscovery and interpretation of the Classical past. We’ll study how the Italians drew on the ideas of classical literature and learning as the basis for revolutions both in artistic practices and the conception of humanity. Greek students will continue learning the language, while the photography and drawing students will choose between the basics of black-and-white photography and art history. In spring, some students will travel to Greece and Italy for six weeks to visit, study, and hold seminars in sites and cities synonymous with the Classical world and the Renaissance. The first four weeks will be in Greece, where we will start in Crete, focusing our attention on the Minoan civilization. Next, we will travel through mainland Greece, visiting numerous sites including Athens, Corinth, Olympia, and Delphi. The final weeks will be spent in Italy, using Florence as our main base but making side trips to nearby sites and cities, such as Siena. Alternatively, students can enhance their learning locally and continue to develop their skills in art history and photography.</p><p>Throughout the program, students will interpret the texts and monuments in essays, and their mastery of the historical contexts and artistic styles will be strengthened and assessed in written exams. While in Greece and Italy, we will maintain academic travel journals in which we synthesize our on-campus learning with the experiences in country. Upon returning, students will prepare presentations to share their discoveries.</p></description>

        <opt_comment><p>Students participating in the six-week study abroad component of Greece and Italy in spring quarter should expect to pay an additional fee of approximately $4,000–$4,500 (depending upon currency valuation). This fee does not include airfare or most food in Italy (students will have kitchens), but does include travel within and between the two countries, lodging, breakfast in Greece, and entrance fees to museums and archaeological sites. A deposit of $200 is due by December 1, 2017.

    <title>Earth Dynamics: People, Place, Technology, and History</title>
    <minimum_credits>16</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>16</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>Human activity shapes the environment. Earth warmed out of the last ice age about 10,000 years ago, enabling our species to develop stable societies and transform the experience of being alive. Agricultural activity emitted greenhouse gases that changed Earth’s air, water, and land. People changed, too, improving technologies and creating written and artistic records of their ideas and histories. Today, we understand our impacts on the environment in ways incomprehensible to our ancestors, and we are challenged to mitigate those impacts with knowledge, skill, and political will.</p><p>This program will examine changes in the Earth system, human understanding of those changes, and the history of technological efforts to enhance human flourishing and shape our impacts on the environment. We&apos;ll study multiple drivers of climate change such as Sun-Earth interactions, volcanoes, industry, consumption, and greenhouse gases. We’ll consider the changing role of science in providing the understanding required for people and planet to thrive together. Students will learn about the history of technology, from the wheel to the internet, and particularly how technological advances shaped values and habits of everyday life in the United States over the last 200 years. We will ask whether and how modern consumer societies are uniquely positioned to hasten and/or slow the rate at which resource use drives the ecosystem. Is global warming simply a disaster, or does it also present an opportunity for global cooperation? How do we adapt in the face of the most dramatic change to the Earth system in recorded history? How can we develop skills and language to think in creative and effective ways about these dynamics, and share what we learn with others? Scientific methods and historical studies will inform each other and provide new tools for thinking about and taking action in our own historical moment.</p><p>Our work will include lectures, discussions, workshops, labs, quantitative homework, expository essays, writing workshops, and teamwork. Quarterly field trips will enable us to learn about sustainability efforts in our region. Students will do hands-on research related to our topics and learn how to analyze and write about everyday technologies in order to teach others how climate impacts intersect with widely held cultural values. Students will have the opportunity to contribute to a published anthology of student research. Credit will be awarded in the natural sciences and the humanities.</p></description>

    <title>Business and Culture Along the Silk Roads: China and Vietnam</title>
    <minimum_credits>8, 12</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>8, 12</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>Business management and cultural competence training are essential for the development of successful and sustainable enterprises. This program will focus on the connections between business, economics, and culture, with a specific application to  trade, cultural exchange,  and community development in Vietnam and China. <br/><br/> For centuries the ancient Silk Roads moved ideas and goods between the great civilizations of Asia, the Pacific Rim, the Middle East, and the New World. Since the eras of Genghis Khan and Marco Polo, the Silk Roads have connected empires and fostered the development of art, religion, culture, and commerce throughout Asia. In this program, we will study contemporary and historical Silk Roads and envision sustainable Silk Roads of the future. We will develop skills and practical knowledge necessary for understanding the socio-economic impacts of the growth of the market economic system in Vietnam and China. We will also examine how immigration and international trade with Vietnam and China can impact the economic future of Washington state. <br/><br/> In fall quarter, we will learn the skills necessary for understanding the historical and cultural significance of Silk Roads and will develop the foundation in economics necessary for understanding the issues in international business and immigration policies toward Vietnam and China. We will study texts of Daoism, Buddhism, and Confucianism to understand philosophical wisdom of traditional Asian cultures and examine roots of Western demonization of China and Vietnam. In winter quarter, we will learn about intercultural communication, leadership, and application of business skills in the development of nonprofit and business enterprises. In Fall and Winter quarter we will practice visual and movement arts to understand relationship of individual to community and the world. At the end of winter quarter, students will have an opportunity to travel with faculty members Thuy Vu and Hirsh Diamant along Silk Roads to China and Vietnam for three weeks. Students will study business, economy, culture, and education. (Various credit options will be available for winter travel.)</p></description>

    <title>Walking to Santiago de Compostela</title>
    <minimum_credits>16</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>16</maximum_credits>
    <description><p><em>El Camino,</em> “The Way,” is a collection of traditional pilgrimage routes that end in Santiago de Compostela, Spain. A monk said, “The only thing all pilgrims have in common is an interior necessity—<em>I must go, I don’t know why </em>…” As we study paths to Santiago, you will learn <em>from—</em>not just <em>about—</em>the <em>Camino.</em> It may teach you why you had to go, about yourself, or how you want to live. This walk is a “focal activity” that makes demands and requires discipline, helps you sense relationships even when walking alone, reassures you about unknown capabilities, and, as one writer put it, gives you a “glimpse of life-giving possibilities.”</p><p>In winter, we will study, first, the political history and the art of walking, especially the connection between walking and writing. Then we will take up the historical, religious, political, and cultural background of the <em>Camino</em> and its place in contemporary Spain. Pilgrims’ accounts provide many takes on why people go to Santiago, what is required physically, mentally, and financially for walking routes that vary from 100 kilometers to more than 1,600 kilometers, what “pilgrimage” might mean in our time, and the kinds of meanings people make of their experiences after they return. Readings will range from the mystical realm to first aid for blisters, from spirit care to foot care, and everything in between. This portion of the program will involve significant lecture time, guest presentations, seminars, and writing. And we will—all together, in small groups, and alone—take some walks. A substantial independent study project will give each student a personal entrée and continuing connection to “The Way.” Projects will be designed to continue during the students’ walks in the spring. Conversational Spanish, integrated within the program, will further students&apos; preparations.</p><p>In spring, everyone will be prepared to get to his or her starting point during the first week and begin his or her <em>Camino</em>. Students will continue their independent studies along the way. Most of week seven or eight will be spent together in Santiago, reflecting thoughtfully, carefully, playfully, and, most important, together on our walks. Then we will probably walk the <em>Camino Finisterre</em>, the old pagan route toward the setting sun, the <em>Costa da Morte</em> (the &quot;Coast of Death&quot;), and “the end of the world.” Some may decide that it is important to follow the route from <em>Finisterre</em> north to Muxía and back to Santiago.</p><p>For a comprehensive program description and supplementary material on the <em>Camino</em>, visit <a href="http://blogs.evergreen.edu/camino/">http://sites.evergreen.edu/camino</a>.</p><p>If you are a student with a disability and would like to request accommodations, please contact the faculty or the office of Access Services (Library Bldg. Rm. 2153, PH (360) 867.6348; TTY (360) 867.6834) prior to the start of the program.</p></description>

    <title>Aotearoa New Zealand: Native Decolonization in the Pacific Rim</title>
    <minimum_credits>16</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>16</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>Maori scholar Linda Tuhiwai Smith asserts, “Our communities, cultures, languages, and social practices—all may be spaces of marginalization, but they have also become spaces of resistance and hope.” In this program we will identify and contextualize these spaces and the politics of indigeneity and settler colonialism. We will use the Pacific Rim broadly as a geographic frame, with a focus on the Pacific Northwest Native nations and the Maori in Aotearoa (New Zealand). By concentrating on a larger region, students will have an opportunity to broaden indigenous studies beyond the Lower 48 states and explore common processes of Native decolonization in different settler societies.</p><p>A comparative study of the role of treaties in Washington state and New Zealand—in natural resources, governance, the arts, education, etc.—will provide a key framework for the program. We will study decolonization through cultural revitalization and sovereign jurisdiction of First Nations. In order to examine the central role of indigenous peoples in the region&apos;s cultural and environmental survival, we will use the lenses of geography, history, and literature.</p><p>In fall, our focus will be on familiarizing students with the concept of sovereignty, working with local Native nations, and preparing to travel to Aotearoa or elsewhere. The concept of sovereignty must be placed within a local, historical, cultural, and global context. Through theoretical readings and discussion, we will move from state-building in the U.S. and Canada to Native forms of nationalism. We will stress the complexities and intricacies of colonization and decolonization by concentrating on the First Nations of western Washington and British Columbia.</p><p>We will later expand the focus to appreciate the similarities and differences of indigenous experiences in other areas of the Pacific Rim, such as Native Alaskans, Aboriginal peoples in Australia, and South Pacific island peoples. We will emphasize common Pacific Rim concerns such as climate change, tourism, and cultural domination.</p><p>For up to seven weeks spanning the last half of winter quarter and the beginning of spring quarter, many of us will travel to Aotearoa, where we will learn in a respectful and participatory way how the Maori have been engaged in revitalizing their language, art, land, and politics, and their still unfolding, changing relationships with the Pakeha (non-Maori) people and society. Alternatively, some students will continue their studies locally. Students will learn about the ongoing effects of colonization as well as gain a foundation in theories and practices of decolonization. We will take as our basic premise in this program that those wishing to know about the history of a particular Native group should study it with a purpose to be in solidarity with these people today.</p><p>Students will develop skills as writers and researchers by studying scholarly and imaginative works, by conducting policy research and fieldwork with Native and non-Native communities, and by comparing community and government relationships in the U.S., Canada, and New Zealand. Students will be expected to integrate extensive readings, lecture notes, films, interviews, and other sources in writing assignments.</p></description>

    <title>Madness and Creativity: The Psychological Link</title>
    <minimum_credits>16</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>16</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>What is creativity? Is there a relationship between a state of mind and a fertile imagination? What are the psychological mechanisms involved in the larger action of the human imagination, which urges us to explore new avenues, to see what others have not seen, to create what no one has yet created? Many of the world&apos;s greatest writers, artists, and thinkers have been known to struggle with conditions classified as abnormal by psychologists. We will explore these conditions and their impact on creativity, searching further for any special links between certain kinds of abnormal psychological conditions and the drive to create. We will also study the normal mind and how it functions in both mundane and creative ways.</p><p>Our interdisciplinary program is not intended to serve as therapy, but rather as a serious study of psychology, literature, the arts, imagination, and the creative impulse. We will approach our questions through various modes of inquiry. Through an in-depth study of abnormal psychology, we will learn to identify and understand a number of conditions. Many of our readings combine art theory with purely scientific psychological case studies by writers such as Sacks and Ramachandran. We will read several selections of imaginative literature by Gogol, Dostoevsky, Poe, Kafka, Plath, Gilman, and other writers describing abnormal psychological conditions. In addition, we will view and study a number of films that reflect incredible creative potential.</p><p>We will respond to our readings and films by channeling the imagination with a variety of creative projects. In both quarters of our program, students will discuss assigned readings and films in seminars, engage in active writing exercises, and develop projects designed to explore and stimulate creativity. Assignments will include essays, poster projects, and other creative activities. Students will also work in small groups to make two short films—one each quarter—shot and edited on home equipment (cell phones, camcorders, and computers). Guest speakers will provide additional workshops and lectures in various artistic modalities. We will take field trips to the Tacoma Art Museum and the Museum of Glass, and our work overall will prepare students to undertake a culminating project in winter term. In all our activities, students will have ample opportunities to explore their own creativity and imagination.</p></description>

    <description><p><em>&quot;The only myth that is going to be worth thinking about in the immediate future is one that is talking about the planet, not the city, not these people, but the planet, and everybody on it.&quot; —</em> Joseph Campbell</p><p>Joseph Campbell points out that our greatest challenge is how to live a humane existence in inhuman times. This program will focus on the individual&apos;s relationship to personal and cultural values, society, leadership, and the creative process. It is intended for students who seek to explore and refine their core values in a context in which they can act upon them with increasing awareness and integrity.</p><p>In every era, people have lived their lives in the face of significant social, ecological, and psychological challenges. It is now widely recognized that crisis often precedes positive transformation. This program will begin by focusing on how people in the past have worked to create a meaningful relationship between themselves and the world around them. We will explore movement, stories, and images of various creative practices and spiritual traditions from ancient to modern times to discover their relevance in our own lives. As students gain knowledge and skills in identifying their personal values, passions, and purpose, they will envision connections between that purpose and the larger world of life. They will cultivate leadership and emotional intelligence skills, build confidence and self-awareness, and—with faculty support—begin to prioritize and pursue their dreams.</p><p>Throughout the year, the program will work with multiple forms of intelligence, somatic practices, and integrative expressive arts approaches to learning. Students will explore the practices of music, movement (such as dance or yoga), writing, drawing, and theater in order to cultivate the senses as well as the imagination and powers of expression. These practices will help us understand the deeper aspects of the human experience, which are the source of self-leadership, intentional living, and positive change. Students will also investigate the relationship between inner transformation and social change through engagement in community service. Students will read mythology, literature, and poetry while exploring ideas that continue to shape contemporary culture. We will also look to indigenous cultures to deepen our appreciation of often-overlooked wisdom and values. We will seek to develop a broader understanding of contemporary culture as a stepping stone to thinking critically about how today&apos;s dreams can become tomorrow&apos;s reality.</p></description>

    <title>Seeds of Change: Food, Culture, and Work</title>
    <minimum_credits>16</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>16</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>We all eat to live, but how often do we stop to ask where our food comes from? How was it grown? Who cultivated and harvested it? How did it arrive at our tables? Do we all have the same access to food? How has the migration of workers to harvest food, as well as their movements for social justice, created new forms of culture—from protest songs to <em>Teatro Campesino</em> (farmworkers’ theater)? How do agricultural and food policies impact the food system? This program seeks to address these questions by examining the intersections of food ecology, labor history, food policy, and cultural change. We will explore how systems of power—involving race, class, and gender, among others—shape work, access to food, governmental policy, and environmental sustainability.</p><p>Fall quarter will focus on three commodities: apples, bananas, and sugar. In each case, we will explore a given crop and how it has affected environmental, economic, social, and cultural relationships over time. We will study the ecological conditions for cultivating this crop, its environmental impact, the ways it is harvested and traded, how workers have attempted to organize themselves, the literature and art that have aided their social movements, and the impact of governmental policies on the crop&apos;s production and workers&apos; rights. We will talk with workers during the fall harvest and hear from local artists and poets about their cultural work relating to agricultural life and social change. A typical week will involve lectures, seminar discussions, films, and workshops on quantitative reasoning and expository writing. Students will write frequent essays about readings in environmental science, social science, and humanities. In addition to field trips, we will engage in organized opportunities to put our learning into action through volunteer work.</p><p>In winter, we will deepen our understanding of concepts introduced in the fall, moving from specific crops to a larger view of intersecting social, political, and environmental systems. Throughout winter quarter, we will continue to have seminars, lectures, and field trips as a program. Since the Washington Legislature will be in session, we will attend a policy meeting or hearing. In addition, students will research crops of their own choosing, developing case studies along the lines we explored together in the fall. Workshops in qualitative and quantitative research methods will support students’ projects. Students will present their learning, first in the form of posters or short skits about food issues, and later in a more formal research presentation.</p></description>

    <title>So You Want to Be a Psychologist</title>
    <minimum_credits>16</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>16</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>Students will investigate theories and practices of psychologists to enhance their understanding of counseling, social services, and the science of psychology. We will cover history and systems of psychology. Students will read original source literature from major divisions of the field, including both classic and contemporary journal articles and books by well-known psychologists. Students will explore careers in psychology and the academic preparations necessary for these career choices. We will cover the typical activities of psychologists who work in academia, schools, counseling, and clinical settings; social work agencies; and applied-research settings.</p><p>Among our studies will be ethical quandaries in psychology, including the ethics of human and animal experimentation. Library research skills, in particular the use of PsycINFO and Science and Social Science Citation Indexes, will be emphasized. Students will gain expertise in the technical writing style of the American Psychological Association (APA). The class format will include lectures, guest speakers, workshops, discussions, films, and an optional field trip.</p><p>There&apos;s no better way to explore the range of activities and topics that psychology offers—and to learn of cutting-edge research in the field—than to attend and participate in a convention of psychology professionals and students. To that end, students have the option of attending the annual convention of the Western Psychological Association (WPA), the western regional arm of the APA. This year&apos;s convention will take place April 26–29, 2018, in Portland, Oregon.</p></description>

    <title>Life as Literature: Studies in Literature, Interpretation, and Writing</title>
    <minimum_credits>16</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>16</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>The outsider philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche once confided in a letter that his only home was between the lines of his writing on the page. What does it mean to write yourself into being? This program will investigate the complex relationships between an author, the reader, and her pages: who or what speaks in a literary work? What emerges through a reader’s work of interpretation—a new work, a translation? This program’s goal is to help you become a more skillful and inventive interpreter, a better reader, and ultimately, a more adept writer. We will study and practice various methods of interpretation of literary texts, focusing on works of autobiography, self-portraiture, and self-creation as alter-ego. We will read poetic, dramatic, and narrative works as well as essays. Readings will include, among others, Martinican Aimé Césaire’s <em>Return to My Native Land</em>;<em> Illuminations</em> by Arthur Rimbaud; Emily Dickinson’s poems; Jean Genet’s <i>The </i><em>Miracle of the Rose</em>; and Anaïs Nin’s <em>Labyrinths.</em> Students will engage in study of interpretive methodologies, read critical essays in philosophical and psychological approaches to literature, and practice interpretive writing as well as creative exercises in writing themselves into being on the page. The program is preparatory for advanced study of world literature.</p></description>

    <title>Women's Work: Weaving Feminism and Math</title>
    <minimum_credits>16</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>16</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>Women across history and cultures have developed and utilized sophisticated mathematics embodied in art and daily living practices like baking, weaving, basketry, and quilting, as well as in household and community management practices like project planning and budgeting resources. Though essential to successful societies, these skills are rarely recognized as legitimate forms of knowledge—let alone as &quot;math.&quot; This program interrogates mathematics as a field of inquiry, asking what is recognized as math and what isn&apos;t, who had and has access to math, and what privileges it gives access to. We will learn mathematics through a variety of hands-on applications and engage with science and technology studies, cultural studies, and feminist theory. This program is at an introductory level, and the humanities portion will involve substantial reading and writing.</p><p>During winter quarter, we will explore the intersection of mathematics with craft and management practices that historically have been done by women in traditional and indigenous cultures. We will also explore the way in which societies throughout the world use mathematics in divination rituals, to mark time, create art, and organize community responsibilities. Through a grounding in feminist critiques (from critical theory, science studies, and women-of-color feminisms), we will examine how mathematical knowledge becomes legitimized and the ways in which power structures influence what counts as knowledge. Students who successfully complete the math portion of winter quarter will earn four credits in discrete math.</p><p>In spring quarter, we will focus on the contemporary discipline of mathematics and the historical events that have shaped what is commonly called “academic mathematics,” creating new roles and invisibilities for women from the industrial era to computer age. We’ll delve into the origins and development of computer technology, and the gendered and racialized aspects of its production and consumption. We’ll engage with the complexities of current debates about women and minorities in STEM (science, technology, engineering and math) education and industries. Students who successfully complete the math portion of spring quarter will earn four credits in algebraic thinking and will be prepared to take precalculus I.</p></description>

    <title>Performance Lab: Theater and Dance</title>
    <minimum_credits>16</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>16</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>This program explores contemporary theater and dance in a hands-on workshop environment. The development and creation of theater, dance, and performance works by the students and faculty will be augmented through a study of theater and dance history. Activities include reading and performing plays, screening films on dance and theater, and ongoing interactive seminars. Daily classes include the disciplined practice of theater and dance techniques, improvisation, and methods of composing and presenting performance work. Workshops include solo and group collaborative projects; strategies for scoring structured improvisation and multimedia work; and basic stagecraft, such as lighting for dance and theater, set design, costuming, and crew and stage management.</p><p>Students will be introduced to basic techniques and theories in winter quarter, which will be devoted to building competency in theater and modern dance with collaborative performance projects. Our work will culminate in a public collaborative concert of student and faculty work in the spring. Works-in-progress will be presented regularly in performance labs for in-depth peer and faculty critique. Theater and dance labs are progressive and full presence. Attendance is essential, and this program requires mature self-direction, independent time management, and organization. We will explore how verbal and nonverbal performance works enhance each other, while contextualizing our work historically and socioculturally.  </p></description>

    <title>Latin American Women Writers</title>
    <minimum_credits>16</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>16</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>In recent decades, Latin America has become well known beyond its borders for compelling, politically urgent, and aesthetically vibrant literary works. Contemporary writings by Latin American women, increasingly available in English translation, challenge preconceptions about gender and sexuality in the region while also addressing critical issues of politically motivated violence, collective memory, intersecting oppressions, language, spirituality, democratization, and social change. This program seeks to foster greater understanding of the region and its diverse peoples and perspectives. Writers will include Gloria Anzaldúa (U.S.), Rosario Castellanos (Mexico), Ana Lydia Vega (Puerto Rico), Rigoberta Menchú (Guatemala), Daisy Zamora (Nicaragua), Conceição Evaristo (Brazil), Cristina Peri Rossi (Uruguay), Luisa Valenzuela (Argentina), and Pía Barros (Chile), among others.</p><p>We will read novels, poetry, short stories, and testimonials by Latin American (indigenous, mestiza, Afro-Latina) women writers, focusing on legacies of colonialism, authoritarianism, and neoliberalism, as well as projects for contesting recent histories. We will situate our literary analysis within the historical and political events that shape Latin American women’s texts, and examine their critique of masculinist narratives that justify domination and exclude women’s voices. We will also view films by and about women, and examine women&apos;s and feminist movements in the region. Students will write literary analyses and some creative work, and will conduct research on a writer of their choice. Through this study, students will consider the impact of political, economic, and cultural forces on Latin American women&apos;s lives and literary production while also examining literary and film representations as potential sites of resistance. </p></description>

    <title>Northwest Forests: Biogeochemistry and Management</title>
    <minimum_credits>16</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>16</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>Forests are among the most biologically complex ecosystems in the world. How do forests develop? How do they function? How do human activities affect them? Is sustainable harvest a reality or an oxymoron? We will use a biogeochemical lens to examine these forests, their effects on us, and our impacts on them. Topics covered will include forest ecology, ecosystem ecology, soil microbial ecology, biogeochemistry, sustainable forestry, and forest conservation.</p><p>In fall quarter, we will explore how forests work through studying forest ecosystem science that includes both global and regional perspectives, with a focus on carbon and nutrient cycling. We will also examine the tremendous fungal biodiversity found within the local forests of the Pacific Northwest. We’ll cover methods in forest biogeochemical measurement, fungal biology, taxonomy, and advanced forest ecology.</p><p>Human impacts on temperate rainforests will be the focus of winter quarter. We’ll focus on sustainable forestry, both theory and practice, along with an examination of soils and the life within them, which will deepen our understanding of forest function and the short- and long-term impacts of various forestry practices. These topics will merge as we explore carbon sequestration in forest ecosystems, which is an emerging component of sustainable forestry. We will explore current and past controversies in forest ecology related to old-growth forests, endangered species, and biofuels.</p><p>Our program time will consist of fieldwork, laboratory work, lectures, workshops, and weekly seminars. Expect to research topics in the primary scientific literature and to summarize and share your findings with the entire class. We’ll cover various sampling techniques that are used to measure nitrogen and carbon cycling in forested ecosystems. Hands-on research experiences will be a core theme for both group and individual projects.</p><p>In addition to one-day trips regularly scheduled throughout both quarters, there will be a multiday field trip each quarter. In the fall, we’ll do field research in northwest forests. In the winter, we’ll tour the Pacific Northwest and visit a variety of managed and unmanaged forests. Plan to spend a lot of time in the field (and remember that every field day generates three to four days of work once we return). Students who may need accommodations for field trips should contact the faculty as soon as possible.</p></description>

    <title>Models of Motion</title>
    <minimum_credits>16</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>16</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>This introductory program integrates first-year calculus and calculus-based physics with topics from relevant areas of history and scientific literature to explore how scientists make sense of, and intervene in, the natural and human-created worlds. Students will be supported to develop a firm background in college-level science, becoming prepared for further work in the mathematical and physical sciences.</p><p>Scientists gather data, make observations, look for patterns, build models, and use those models to predict behavior. Powerful models in physics help us explain interactions involving matter and energy; such understanding forms the essential background for our modern technological society. New models require new mathematical methods—for example, calculus was developed partly to understand models of motion. Even with powerful mathematics, a model may yield answers only in simplified circumstances. We can analyze more complicated physical systems by simulating them on a computer. Learning how to create and apply mathematical and computational methods to models in physics will be one of the major goals of this program.</p><p>The program will have a significant collaborative laboratory component to explore and analyze the nature of mathematical and physical systems. Workshops and seminar discussions will also allow for collaborative work on math and physics problems as well as an opportunity to explore connections between history, theory, and practice. The program is intended for students with solid high school-level backgrounds in science and mathematics; in particular, a good grasp of precalculus (including algebra and trigonometry) is required. Equally important for success, however, will be a commitment to working hard and learning effectively in groups.</p><p>The work will be intensive and challenging, but also exciting; students should expect to spend at least 50 hours per week engaged with material during and outside of class. The program will include readings, lectures, labs, workshops, seminars, projects, frequent homework sets, quizzes, and exams; students will have multiple opportunities to demonstrate the knowledge they have gained in each of these settings. Students who successfully complete all three quarters of the program will have covered material equivalent to a year of calculus and calculus-based physics with lab, along with several courses in history and philosophy of math and physics, and will be prepared for upper-division work in mathematics and physics.</p></description>

    <description><p>Marketing is a process of customer satisfaction that begins with knowing who the customers and potential customers are and how to meet their needs. A business organization can exist only so long as it fulfills its customers’ needs and wants by accurately identifying and thoroughly understanding them. Therefore, how do we apply critical-thinking skills to business management and marketing? In particular, what is the role of consumer behavior in marketing research? How do consumers’ beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors form and change? What roles do culture and social influences play in marketing?</p><p>In the process of answering these questions, students will learn fundamental concepts necessary to understanding factors that influence consumer behavior. They will be exposed to quantitative methods relating to business and to marketing in particular. They will learn the role of consumer behavior in making marketing management decisions and the use of statistical presentation software such as Tableau to analyze consumers. Other topics will include marketing research methods, environmental analysis, market segmentation, product positioning, brand perceptions, and marketing mix. Credit will likely be awarded in microeconomics, business, marketing, and quantitative methods. Our exploration will include lectures, seminars, workshops, films, guest speakers, and student presentations.</p></description>

    <maximum_credits>12, 16</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>One historic purpose of a liberal arts education is to discover the nature of human life. A consequence of research in artificial intelligence and cognitive science is that some of the things we thought were uniquely human are shared by machines on the one hand and (other) animals on the other. A unifying theme of this program is what it means to be human in light of these recent developments in science. The goals of this program are to learn what mindfulness is and how to apply it to programming, as well as how to solve complex cognitive problems with a computer.</p><p>Mindfulness is the ability to fully attend to what is at hand and be in the present moment. Mindfulness can be applied to a variety of fields, including mathematical and computational thinking. The practice of mindfulness can increase our individual and collective resiliency to respond to changing personal and global situations in adaptive and creative ways.</p><p>The program will be organized around these content areas: artificial intelligence systems and artificial life; computability; general problem-solving; and mindfulness. We will explore these topics through lectures, programming and robotics labs, workshops, writing and seminars, and mindfulness practice logs. Students will be expected to read primary sources in computer science and cognitive as well as contemplative science. The mindfulness component will include theory, practice, and application in relation to computational and algorithmic thinking. Questions to be explored include how mindfulness can be integrated with the study of computing.</p><p>The program is broken down into two parts: the application of mindfulness to computer science and the study of mindfulness itself. The study of mindfulness will take place in five all-day sessions on alternating Saturdays. Applications to computer science will take place Monday through Thursday during the day.</p></description>

    <title>Studio, Archive, Field: Advanced Projects in Media and Visual Art</title>
    <minimum_credits>16</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>16</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>In this program, students prepared for intensive study of the theory and practice of contemporary art and media will pursue capstone projects in film, video, sound, installation, and 2-D and 3-D visual arts in a directed and supportive learning community. The program will support students as they forge their own research-based artistic practice that combines creative and critical methods. Students will develop their projects in the context of this program&apos;s specific focus on the site, shape, and significance of iteration, duration, and structured experimentation in the creative process; in particular, we will consider the <em>studio</em>, the <em>archive</em>, and the <em>field</em> (or site-specificity) as three distinct but interrelated locations and methodologies of art-making that require different ways of thinking, working, and being in relationship to one’s materials, communities, and contexts. <span>Students with a significant background in media theory or art history who wish to engage in an arts-based practice or academic project such as museum studies, curatorial and archival practices, or an arts-related internship are also welcome.</span></p><p>In fall, we will establish our homeroom-studio as students set up their own workspaces there and at home. We will study artists whose practice is based in archival research and fieldwork. We will then explore the archive and the field as spaces for our own artistic research as students complete collaborative and individual assignments by working in local archives and pursuing observational and other site-based practices in the field.</p><p>In winter, we will deepen our understanding of the ethics, stakes, and politics of the archive, fieldwork, and site-specificity, and students will organize into groups and create a shared syllabus for weekly meetings. Students will plan and complete an individual creative project, creating an individual syllabus that outlines research in the archive and the field. They will maintain a creative practice in their studios and acquire new skills in workshops, as needed.</p><p>In spring, students will expand their winter project or complete a new project, again based in archival and field research and studio practice. We will consider the question of exhibition and audiences as students collaboratively design and host a final conference and exhibition of their work at the end of the program. Students will also attend workshops on professional practices and protocols, discuss the job and graduate school search, prepare for the application process, and consider the world of grant funding.</p><p>Throughout the year, students will present their work and engage in extensive discussion and critique at each stage of their process. Students will share skills and provide support on their peers’ projects. Students will attend lectures, screenings, and workshops as well as the art lecture series, participate in group critiques, read and discuss research material and texts, complete writing assignments, lead seminar, present their research, and learn how to more effectively document and reflect critically on their working methods and processes.</p><p>We will take an overnight field trip in fall. We will also spend time in local or regional archives and establish a site-based practice in winter and spring. While travel is not required in winter and spring, our program will accommodate short trips as part of students’ site-based practice.</p></description>

    <title>Even When Erased, We Exist: Native American Women Standing Strong for Justice</title>
    <minimum_credits>16</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>16</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>Native American women have been erased from history. It is not that they did not exist; it is that they were <em>made invisible</em>, omitted from history. At the same time, stereotypes such as &quot;squaw&quot; and &quot;princess&quot; have plagued Native women since 1492. Ironically, the history of Native women reflects a different reality with a long tradition of standing strong for justice. Native women have stood to protect the lands and the natural world, their cultures and languages, the health of their families, and tribal sovereignty. But few learn about these Native women, who consistently defied the stereotypes in order to work for the betterment of their peoples and nations.</p><p>Drawing upon the experiences and writings of such women, we will explore the ways in which leadership is articulated in many Native American communities. We will critique how feminist theory has both served and ignored Native women. Through case studies, autobiography, literature, and films, we will analyze how Native women have argued for sovereignty and developed agendas that privilege community over individuality. We will explore the activism of 20th-century Native women leaders, particularly in the areas of the environment, the family system, and the law.</p><p>This program will implement decolonizing methodologies to give voice to some of these women, while deconstructing the stereotypes in order to honor and provide a different way of knowing about these courageous Native American women, past and present. Students will develop skills as writers, researchers, and potential advocates by studying scholarly and imaginative works and conducting research. Through extensive reading and writing, dialogue, art, films, and possible guest speakers, we will investigate important aspects of the life and times of some of these Native American women across the centuries.</p></description>

    <title>Research Capstone in Psychology</title>
    <minimum_credits>16</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>16</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>This program is designed to provide a capstone opportunity for juniors and seniors within psychology (or closely related social science disciplines such as sociology or cultural anthropology) to conduct independent research projects within a supportive intellectual environment of other researchers. Research projects may be inductive or deductive in their approach, and may utilize qualitative or quantitative methodology. Research may be aimed at testing a well-established theory, replicating a study, crafting an elegant psychological experiment, designing and executing a written survey, conducting interviews, or engaging in observational ethnographic research. </p><p>Students will form research groups within the program based on shared research interests (or methodological or theoretical interests). Faculty will provide structured support to these learning communities across all aspects of the research process. Students entering this capstone program should do so with a particular research project in mind, although faculty will work one-on-one with students to help shape the nature of their project in both practical and theoretically meaningful ways.</p><p>Students will attend the annual meeting of the Western Psychological Association (WPA) in Portland, Oregon, from April 26–29, 2018. This field trip will provide direct exposure to researchers in psychology, enabling students to talk with other researchers (many of whom are undergraduate or graduate students); find out about the latest trends in research psychology; and be intellectually stimulated by poster sessions, panel presentations, and talks from well-known scholars in the field.</p><p>Students who successfully complete this capstone program will have collected, analyzed, and written up their findings by the end of spring quarter 2018. This program is timed to correspond with the November 2018 deadline to apply to present research findings at WPA the following spring.</p></description>

    <title>God(s): An Inquiry</title>
    <minimum_credits>16</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>16</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>This program will take students on an exploration of the persistent human quest to locate, identify, describe, ascribe power to, and/or worship deities or phenomena outside ourselves. We take as a point of departure that this impulse has been with us as a species since the beginning of recorded human history. As such, by investigating extant sources that document this, we can ask <em>why</em> and <em>how</em> this instinct developed—and why it continues to sustain itself. We begin with ancient Chinese, African, Mesopotamian, Indus (Hindu and Buddhist), Greek, and Egyptian religions (all the while problematizing the meaning of the word &quot;religion&quot;), and move on to the development of monotheism begun by Hebrew tribes, to the development of Western philosophies rooted in these traditions, to the present where the insistence on no (sure) God(s) (atheism and agnosticism) has gathered steam and developed its own ideologies, including scientism.</p><p>Students will develop analytic skills in critical historical method, history, philosophy, critical theory, and the study of religion. Readings will include primary sources from each tradition we study, in addition to secondary sources that come to terms with them. Readings include, for example, selections from the Egyptian<em> Book of the Dead,</em> Homer, the<em> Upanishads,</em> the Hebrew<em> Bible,</em> Kant, Islamic exegesis, and readings in the New Atheist movement.</p></description>

    <title>Asian/American: Pop Culture Crosscurrents</title>
    <minimum_credits>16</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>16</maximum_credits>
    <description><p><em>“Japanese jazz now hip-hop in home/At Seventh and Jackson, the microphone’s open.” — </em>Blue Scholars, Seattle hip-hop duo (from “Evening Chai”)</p><p>From Bruce Lee to <em>Harold &amp; Kumar</em>, henna to hip-hop, bulgogi to ph<span>ở</span>, manga to <em>The Matrix</em>, Asians and Asian Americans have left an indelible imprint on U.S. popular culture. As eloquently noted by Mimi Thi Nguyen and Thuy Linh Nguyen Tu, “[f]ew of us are immune to popular culture’s intimate address or to its pleasures and affirmations, frustrations and denials” (<em>Alien Encounters: Popular Culture in Asian America</em>). It is, indeed, that lack of immunity and a restless hunger to understand those “pleasures, affirmations, frustrations, and denials” that will sustain us on our 10-week journey. We will begin the quarter with two fundamental questions—“What is an Asian American?” and “What is popular culture?&quot;—that will lead us to (1) an exploration of the major historical, cultural, social, and political contours of the Asian American experience, and (2) an immersion in critical theoretical perspectives on culture in general, and popular culture in particular. We will devote the remainder of the quarter to an examination of the complex, and frequently vexed, ways in which Asians and Asian Americans have been represented in U.S. popular culture and, more importantly, how members of those communities have become active <em>producers</em> of popular culture. Our approach will be interdisciplinary, multilayered, and transgressive in its insistence on an intertextuality that moves beyond the commonly interrogated categories of race, gender, and class.</p><p>Students will read selected fiction, poetry, comics, graphic novels, scholarly articles, and other written texts. There will be weekly screenings and analysis of documentaries as well as fictional films, including martial arts and anime. We will also explore Asian American popular culture in music, photography, and other visual art; bodies (e.g., tattoos); and cuisine. Students will participate in weekly seminars and workshops, submit short weekly writing assignments, and produce a final project that will help them refine both their expository and creative nonfiction writing skills. Field trips may include visits to Pacific Northwest locations with Asian/Pacific Islander historical and cultural connections, and to off-campus film, music, and other venues.</p></description>

    <title>Living Well: The Anthropology of Sustainability</title>
    <minimum_credits>16</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>16</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>What can we learn from past and current cultures about how to best live on this planet? How have people throughout time met their basic needs, and what systems appear to be more sustainable than others? What are your own goals for sustainable living today?</p><p>From foraging cultures of the past, to off-the-grid communities or urban neighborhoods of today, we will explore cultural approaches to life that demonstrate prudent use of resources while maintaining thriving, healthy communities. Students will build vocabularies, analyses, and hands-on skills in the fields of both anthropology and sustainability.</p><p>Student work will include careful reading, reflection, and critical analysis based on program materials. Readings will include ethnographic studies of various cultural groups, as well as guides for contemporary sustainable living. Students will design and craft their own ethnographic interviews, focusing on sustainability and justice change agents in the local area. The program will include field trips to local communities where students can interact with people building intentional, sustainable communities. Additionally, a community partnership component will enable us to connect with local initiatives, apply our knowledge, and offer something to the community. We will spend some portion of each week in a community partnership setting.</p></description>

    <title>Political Economy of Revolutions and Social Movements of the 20th and 21st Century</title>
    <minimum_credits>16</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>16</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>The 20th century is characterized as a century of revolutions, and it witnessed a variety of them—each with its own particular theoretical underpinnings as well as political, social, economic, and cultural dimensions. This program will examine the historico-material conditions that gave rise to revolutions, the theories that guided them, and the people who participated in social movements concurrent with revolutions in an attempt to change both society and social consciousness.</p><p>
      Through the disciplinary lenses of history, political economy, feminist theory, and development economics, this program will explore how various revolutionary ideas and movements have emerged and changed over time, in the contexts of Latin America, Asia, and Europe. In fall quarter, we will begin with the Mexican Revolution of 1910, the Russian Revolution of 1917, the Spanish Civil War of the 1930s, the Vietnam War, and then the Cuban Revolution of 1952 and Chilean c
      <span>oup d&apos;état of </span>
      1973. In each of these countries, we will look at the role of women, workers, and peasants in revolutionary movements, as well as the role of the ruling classes, the landed elite, and the armed forces. We will examine the differences in strategy and organizational forms of groups working to transform society. In addition, we will examine the influence of U.S. foreign and economic policy in suppressing liberatory movements.
    </p><p>Alongside our study of political movements, we will also examine different philosophical frameworks such as liberalism, Marxism, feminism, anarchism, and political economy, as well as neoclassical economics, and their explanations of the current U.S. and global political economy. Recurring themes will include the study of exploitation, alienation, reform and fundamental change, and popular power. We will also focus on the construction of alternatives to capitalism, nationally and globally.</p><p>In winter we will move forward chronologically from our fall quarter foundation. Framing our cases within the current context of neoliberalism, we will engage with the Nicaraguan Revolution in 1979; indigenous resistance movements in Chiapas, Mexico; the Bolivarian Revolution in Venezuela; and the 2011 Arab Spring.</p><p>During fall and winter there will be 4 credits each quarter of Spanish-language study at different levels of proficiency embedded in the program.</p><p>During spring quarter students may apply for a field component in Oaxaca, Mexico for further study. Whether in Oaxaca or Olympia, students will pursue activities including research projects, volunteer work with nongovernmental organizations, art, and cultural study to accompany student research projects, and continued study of the Spanish language.</p></description>

    <title>China at the Crossroad of Tradition and Modernity</title>
    <minimum_credits>16</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>16</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>This program aims to study China—both as a powerful nation in the global community and as a unique and complex cultural entity constantly wrestling with traditional and modern ideologies and practices at its very core. The long Chinese history and the fast-paced modernization process have put today’s China at a crossroad of confusion and potential, and the constant debates and negotiations between the old and the new permeate every aspect of the current Chinese society. Such tension between tradition and modernity gives us a glimpse of the Chinese national characteristics on the international stage, and sheds light on many domestic social and political issues that have attracted world attention.</p><p>Since the quarter is short, we will choose only a few topics—including interrelated elements from the fields of medicine, arts, literature, environment, public media, and religious beliefs—as distinct examples that bring the tension between tradition and modernity into sharp focus. Faculty will select topics and examples with care, and develop lectures, readings, and workshops that illuminate these selective and complex topics. Students will be encouraged to develop their own research projects and look into specific areas of interest under faculty guidance. The purpose of the program is to develop a general understanding of China’s unique role in today’s globalized world as well as an appreciation for China’s complex national identity marked by history, tradition, and unstoppable progress.</p></description>

    <title>Salmon, Raven, and Whale: The Pacific Northwest in Art and Science</title>
    <minimum_credits>16</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>16</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>Both art and science require close observation of the natural world and critical thinking about what you see. People have been making these close observations and analyses of animals, plants, and ecology for as long as people have been living in the Pacific Northwest. It has not been until relatively recently in our history that we have divided these activities into two separate disciplines. Despite this separation, certain Pacific Northwest animals—including salmon, ravens, and whales—have continued to capture the imagination of people in both disciplines.</p><p>In this program we will examine the natural history of the Pacific Northwest through the lenses of art and biology and compare and contrast these ways of looking at the world. We will emphasize close observation and critical and creative thinking around interpreting what we observe. Students will learn about the natural history of the region with an emphasis on ecology and animal behavior through lectures, workshops, and fieldwork. The program work will include significant time in the studio to develop drawing and 3-D art skills as well as students’ aesthetic sense and skills in peer critique. Students are expected to spend time in the field refining their observation, field research, and art skills. In reading the work of artists and scientists who focus on the Pacific Northwest, we will look for commonalities and differences in their approaches both between individuals and between disciplines. We will critique both works of art and works of biology for their creative and scientific content. </p><p>The goal of this program is to provide students with the opportunity to develop a good foundation in art and natural history and to practice interdisciplinary thinking with regard to these fields. Throughout the program we will come back to the three title animals to provide key examples of everything from capturing movement and form to ecological interactions. You do not need to have any prior experience in art or biology to be successful in this program.</p></description>

    <title>Performing Stories Through Music, Dance, and Theater</title>
    <minimum_credits>16</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>16</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>This program has as its focus the ways in which people tell and adapt stories to reflect their priorities and the ways they see the world. How are stories drawn out of people? In Southeast Asia, for example, storytelling through the use of puppetry is a normal and expected part of adult interaction. In Ireland, storytelling might occur through song. In modern dance, powerful messages can be conveyed through both abstract and direct means. How are stories adopted, adapted, expressed, and reacted to across cultures? How does a biblical story turn into a bluegrass gospel tune, or a Greek myth become reinterpreted in a Brazilian film? While our words may be limited to the English language, our field is the world. The faculty for this program have extensive experience living and studying outside the United States, and bring multiple perspectives and ways of seeing the world to bear in our collective exploration.</p><p>Students should expect a performance component and also a strong emphasis on the written word. In many cases, stories take life only when they leave the page and find expression in the performing arts. In other cases, a vision that is expressed through the arts may develop deeper meaning through its adaptation to the written word. In all cases, however, interpretation is an essential go-between, and our roles as interpreters form an important part of the objects of study.</p><p>In fall, we will begin with the roots of some of the world’s essential stories from multiple cradles of civilization: Greece, the Middle East, China, West Africa, and elsewhere. In winter, we will focus more specifically on writing stories based on what we have come to know. Working collaboratively with our colleagues, we will engage in small, in-house performances of adaptations of these stories.</p><p>All of our work will be supplemented with the work of visiting artists, live performances, and a culminating visit to the Oregon Shakespeare Festival in Ashland, Oregon. Because we work in multiple media (including sound, film, and the body, as well as the pen and computer), all students are expected to work with aspects of performance regularly in the program. We will watch, we will move, we will write, and we will make music; we will also examine what we have seen and done through seminars and in-class discussions. How would you render a work of Shakespeare in song? How would you turn a film into a poem, a dance into a play, a prophecy into a book?</p></description>

    <title>Moving Toward Health</title>
    <minimum_credits>16</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>16</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>This program will explore cultural determinants of health for communities and individuals through cross-cultural and mind-body perspectives. How can cultural practices become an integral part of prevention and education in promoting health in culturally respectful ways? How can we engage in transformational conversations about the connections between personal, community, and planetary health? Beginning with the premise that in every moment choices we make can move us toward health or away from it, this program will explore myriad ways in which we can embody choices that keep us and our communities vital and alive. Throughout the program, we will recognize that our individual choices can help us create both personal health and a sustainable environment, a conscious life and a positive presence in society.</p><p>In fall quarter, we will explore systems of health and healing from multicultural, neurobiological, and ecopsychological lenses. There is a synergistic relationship between planetary and personal well-being; the health of one is related to the health of the other. We will explore this relationship between the body and the natural world. We&apos;ll also explore interdisciplinary ways of promoting health, including health care practices, the use of food as medicine, communication, and engagement with social issues. Winter quarter will provide an opportunity for students to design their own health-based project studies while continuing to explore cultural systems of health from both Eastern and Western paradigms.</p><p>Students will have an opportunity to learn in many ways, using diverse modalities, including working with multiple intelligences and mindfulness practices. We will integrate somatic learning into our studies, including movement, <em>qigong </em>(a Chinese system of physical exercises and breathing control), and expressive arts workshops. Our inquiry will ask us to attune ourselves to the wisdom that is available and present in our mind-body awareness. We will participate in community readings, community service, rigorous writing assignments, and critical study of important texts. Some of the authors we will read include Dr. Norman Doidge, Paul Pitchford, Dr. Daniel Siegel, and Joanna Macy.</p></description>

    <title>Development as Freedom</title>
    <minimum_credits>16</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>16</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>What does it mean to live a fulfilling life? What factors contribute to a greater quality of life, assuming this is a desirable goal for all human societies? What are some of the prevailing theories and practices within the social sciences about human well-being and how best to attain it, at the individual and international scales?</p><p>This program will tackle these questions, focusing on perspectives from the subdisciplines of health psychology, critical development studies, and environmental justice. We will be studying applications of sociocultural, psychosocial, somatic, and behavioral knowledge relevant to health and wellness from diverse cultural perspectives. We will critically examine perspectives in mainstream economic development theory and their implications for social and environmental justice. We will consequently explore alternative conceptualizations of development, considering those that draw on ideas of freedom, capabilities, and sustainable livelihoods.</p><p>This interdisciplinary program will include a variety of approaches to learning, including seminars, theoretical assessments, films, expressive arts workshops, somatic practices, and reflective and analytical writing. Students will read literature from psychology, integrative health, critical development studies, and environmental justice. Some of the authors we will read include Amartya Sen, Martha Nussbaum, Helena Norberg-Hodge, and Joanna Macy.</p><p>There&apos;s no better way to explore the range of activities and topics that psychology offers—and to learn of cutting-edge research in the social science field—than to attend and participate in a convention of psychology professionals and students. To that end, our program will take a one-day field trip to attend the annual convention of the Western Psychological Association, the western regional arm of the <span>American Psychological Association</span>. This year&apos;s convention will take place April 26–29, 2018, in Portland, Oregon.</p></description>

    <title>Reservation-Based Community-Determined Program: Rebuilding Native Nations: Strategies for Governance and Development</title>
    <minimum_credits>12</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>12</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>This program teaches from a Native-based perspective within the context of the larger global society and is designed for students who have social, cultural, or economic ties to tribes. The curriculum addresses three themes that rotate yearly. For 2017–2018, the theme is Rebuilding Native Nations: Strategies for Governance and Development<em>.</em> The program equips students with foundational knowledge for working within administrative frameworks in public and governmental structures. Outcomes include an understanding of the theoretical and practical characteristics of public administration and how it specifically relates to tribal administration and governance.</p><p>In fall, students are introduced to the major trends and issues in Tribal Administration by comparing and contrasting different approaches to tribal management development and the factors contributing to successful nation building. During winter quarter, students will learn about Ethics for Tribal Vitality, which is an exploration of major ethical theories and their applications to a variety of current issues. Students will explore various Native perspectives on ethics and the ways in which they are manifest in contemporary Native America. Developing analytic skills and critical thinking abilities is a key aspect of this course through, among other things, the analysis of cases studies on current issues in Indian communities. In spring, students will be enrolled in Profiles in Leadership, which explores leadership in both mainstream and tribal contexts; students will examine how political and social forces create leaders and make history.</p><p>The five curricular elements of the program are Core Course, Integrated Skills, Strands, Integrated Seminar, and Independent Study. The Core Course, taught from a tribal perspective in a global community, is a 9-credit unit within the program taught at all sites at the same time and with the same readings and assignments, but it allows for faculty/student innovation and site specification. Integrated Skills, including critical thinking and analysis, research and writing, public speaking, collaboration, personal authority, and indigenous knowledge, are taught across the curriculum, and integrated into all teaching and learning at the sites and at Saturday classes. Strands are 2-credit courses taught on four Saturdays per quarter; these allow for breadth in the program and make it possible to invite professionals and experts in specific fields to offer courses that otherwise might not be available to students in the program. The Integrated Seminar, Battlegrounds, held on the same four Saturdays as the Strands, is a 1-credit workshop generally built around Native case studies. The program also includes student-initiated work through Independent Study.</p></description>

    <title>Investigating the Mind-Body: Biology and Beyond</title>
    <minimum_credits>16</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>16</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>Western science has traditionally considered the mind and body as separate entities. Yet substantial research indicates that the relationship and interactions between the mind and the body are much more complex and intimate than previously imagined. Considered as a single holistic entity, the human mind-body has an innate capacity for healing that involves complex interactions between the nervous system, immune system, endocrine system, gastrointestinal system, and other physiologic systems. In addition, our microbiome is now known to be an important component of, and mediator of, the mind-body conversation. Finally, our social circumstances—where we grow up, live, work, and heal—provide an important external framework for stressors and resources that ultimately determine much of our embodied health.</p><p>In this program, we will explore the biological principles underlying mind-body health, and will engage in an epistemological inquiry about why it is that we believe what we believe about the body, health, and healing. We will study stress physiology and how we embody our lived experiences, the connections of the gastrointestinal nervous system and the microbiome to mental and physical health, as well as neuropsychological phenomena such as the placebo effect. We will examine the underlying beliefs and approaches of traditional medical research and evidence-based medicine, which utilize physiologic measurements that tend to reflect an understanding of body systems that function independently of each other. Such questions will also direct our investigation of the methods of inquiry and nature of the evidence underlying alternative and complementary medical practices.</p><p>Students will have the opportunity to work independently to research an alternative or complementary medicine modality, such as traditional Chinese medicine, vibrational medicine, Ayurvedic medicine, or others. This may involve interviews, observations, and practice, as well as probing primary scientific literature. Our study will include lectures, guest speakers, seminars, films, and some opportunities for practicing mind-body connections. All the while, we will support students in assimilating and synthesizing their learning though their minds and their bodies.</p></description>

    <title>Poetry New York</title>
    <minimum_credits>12, 16</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>12, 16</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>The goal of this program is to immerse students in an intense and vigorous writing community, both as writers of poetry and as critical writers and readers. It is hoped that this daily contact with practicing writers, poets, translators, and publishers will advance each student&apos;s writing horizons and range of reading possibilities, demystify the practice and profession of writing, and inspire students to advance in their own art.</p><p>This field study program features an immersion in New York City&apos;s poetry, literary, art, and publishing worlds. We will spend two weeks on campus preparing for our trip by way of various readings on New York&apos;s literary history and the New York School of poets. The focus will be on the relationships between poetry and painting in John Ashbery, Barbara Guest, and James Schuyler; the connections between current publishers like Ugly Duckling Presse and New Directions Publishing Company and the writers they choose to publish; and New York&apos;s international literary character. We will then fly to New York City for five weeks, where, in addition to class meetings, students will pursue their own writing, write critical pieces on the poetry they hear at readings and on the books they read for class, interview poets they meet, and be required to attend at least one event a day (or night) across the city. St. Mark&apos;s Poetry Project, Academy of American Poets, The New York Public Library, Poets House, and so on—all are options for students to pursue their writing. Local projects might include working on poems to appear in public spaces in the city, working collaboratively on translations of poets writing in other languages while in town, interning at a publishing house, or compiling a journal of field notes. We will also visit the offices of various publishers for an up-close look at how literature is made. Some of these publishers might include The New York Review of Books; Archipelago Books; Rizzoli; New Directions; Farrar, Straus and Giroux, etc.</p><p>The final three weeks of the quarter will be spent back on campus in Olympia. We will debrief, finish poems and essays, and produce an anthology of our work.</p></description>

    <title>Gateways for Incarcerated Youth</title>
    <minimum_credits>16</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>16</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>This program offers Evergreen students the opportunity to co-learn with individuals incarcerated in a maximum-security institution for juvenile males. It is high-stakes work that demands consistent engagement—approximately 10-12 hours a week in class and four to six hours a week at the institution (including travel time). The learning of students enrolled in this program fuels and is fueled by the learning of the incarcerated students.</p><p>A fundamental principle of the Gateways program is that every person has talents given to them at birth and valuable experiences that can contribute to our shared learning. It is our job as humans to encourage each other to seek out and develop our passions and gifts. These values are manifested in the practices of popular education, which will serve as both the process and the content of our work. Our goal is to create an environment in which each person becomes empowered to share their knowledge, creativity, values, and goals by connecting respectfully with people from other cultural and class backgrounds. All students will wrestle with topics in diversity and social justice alongside other subjects chosen by the incarcerated students; the main feature of popular education is that it empowers those seeking education to be the local experts in shaping their own course of study.</p><p>Popular education works through conscientization, the ongoing process of joining with others to give a name to socioeconomic conditions, to reflect critically on those conditions, and thereby to imagine new possibilities for living. In order to do this work successfully, students will practice learning how to meet other learners where they are at (literally, in order to better understand the conditions that put some of us in prisons and others in colleges). Students will also develop or hone their skills in contextualizing and analyzing socioeconomic phenomena. Most importantly, students will learn that solidarity does not mean saving other people or solving their problems—it means creating conditions that allow them to articulate those problems through genuine dialogue and supporting them as they work toward their own solutions.</p><p>Program participants will have the opportunity to reflect on how different individuals access and manifest their learning as they gain experience in facilitating discussions and workshops. In the process of collectively shaping the Gateways seminar, they will also learn how to organize productive meetings and work through conflict. Each quarter, students will take increasing responsibility for designing, implementing, and assessing the program workshops and seminars. Throughout the year, we will seek to expand our collective knowledge about various kinds of relative advantage or privilege while continually working to create a space that is welcoming and generative for all learners.</p><p>High-stakes community-based work requires trust, and trust requires sustained commitment. This program requires that all participants be ready to commit themselves to the program for the entire academic year.</p></description>

    <description><p>What do we need to know in order to understand the fundamental economic, political, and social forces that shape our world, and how can we participate effectively in shaping those forces? This program offers a starting point for answering these questions.</p><p>This program is the primary gateway to the study of political economy at Evergreen. It introduces students to the fundamental building blocks of political-economic analysis: the history and institutions of capitalism, mainstream and alternative economic frameworks, theories of democracy, and theories of social change. We add to this a study of social movements in the past and present, looking at persuasive goals in relation to economic and political conditions, and learning about methods of influencing public attitudes and institutional policies.</p><p>The program will include introductory economics from a political economy perspective. We will study microeconomic topics such as the structure and failure of markets; work and wages; the economic causes of climate change, poverty and growing economic inequality; and the gender and racial division of labor. We will study macroeconomics topics, including austerity policies and critiques of it, the role of debt, the impacts of globalization, and causes and solutions for unemployment and economic instability.</p><p>We will examine political economy at all scales, from the very local to the international, and we’ll analyze oppression, exploitation, and inequality in its different forms—race, class, gender, nationality, and other statuses and identities. Special attention will be given to the role of culture in maintaining or challenging mainstream political and economic ideology. Students will expand their capacity to engage in public debate and social-justice organizing by building skills in democratic decision-making, critical thinking, economic analysis, writing, researching, public speaking, media production, and quantitative methods.</p></description>

    <title>Culture as History</title>
    <minimum_credits>8</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>8</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>Our national myths and cultural icons will provide the lens through which we will examine American history in this yearlong program. Students will study diverse works in order to learn how our culture shapes our understanding of past and present realities. We’ll look at cultural products, from high art to popular culture, with a particular focus on film and literature, to see how they reflect and shape our ideas about who and what we are. Our study will be organized around three turbulent decades in American history.</p><p>During fall quarter we will consider the post-Civil War years, to include Reconstruction and western expansion. From dime novels to Hollywood westerns, we’ll examine how deeply we are shaped by 19th and 20th century frontier ideology. Money and technology—capitalism and the railroads—also drove westward migration. We’ll explore the tensions around race and class as they figure in film, novels, and popular culture.</p><p>In winter we&apos;ll move to the 1930s. How did the Great Depression and the policy created to deal with that crisis change the way we see government? What was the impact of two great migrations—from the Dust Bowl states to the West, and from the agricultural South to the industrial North—on American society? In such a time of hardship and deprivation, how did the golden age of Hollywood reflect our cultural realities through genre films, such as the screwball comedy, the musical, and the gangster film?</p><p>In the spring, we’ll focus on the 1950s and ’60s and how upward—and outward—mobility informed who and where we are today. The Civil Rights Movement and the Vietnam War transformed the country. Cars, freeways, and the rise of the suburbs reshaped the cultural landscape, and television expanded the scope of mass media and popular culture.</p><p>Students will learn about schools of cultural criticism using different approaches to enrich their analyses. They will participate in seminars, lectures, workshops, and library research—and attend field trips to local museums and live theater performances.</p></description>

    <title>Learning About Learning in Nature</title>
    <minimum_credits>16</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>16</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>What can nature teach us? How do we learn? How might experiences in nature help us understand how learning occurs and how we can support the learning of others? We will investigate these questions through an introduction to how our brains learn and change, as well as an introduction to the ecology of western Washington.</p><p>We will start by examining ourselves as learners, the filters that we carry, and how we create memories. Expanding our scope, we’ll explore some of the ways to facilitate the learning of others. We will look at how groups form and function, and we will consider the role of group work in educational strategies. The history and influence of nature-based education will form a theoretical perspective to inform our field studies. At the same time, we will experience the ecosystems of western Washington as a learning laboratory where we can observe, test, and examine nature education in action.</p><p>Topics will be covered through texts, workshops, seminars, field trips, and lectures. There will be two multiday field trips, as well as a number of day trips. Students will be expected to research topics, write papers, and give presentations, both individually and in small groups. Student progress will be assessed through discussions, written assignments, exams, individual and group projects, and participation in program activities.</p></description>

    <title>The Nature of Music: Patterns, Paradox, and Possibility</title>
    <minimum_credits>16</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>16</maximum_credits>
    <description><p><em>“If you look deep enough you will see music; the heart of nature being everywhere music.&quot;</em> — Thomas Carlyle</p><p><em>“Intelligence is the ability to take in information from the world and to find patterns in that information that allow you to organize your perceptions and understand the external world.”</em> — Brian Greene</p><p>The human brain seeks comprehension through the identification of patterns. Yet while we seek predictable organization, we also crave the excitement of the unexpected. Could an examination of this paradoxical human desire increase our understanding of the powerful role music plays in the lives of individuals and the communities in which they live? In this program, we will examine the many layers of patterns that fill our music, as well as the unexpected disruptions within those patterns that captivate our imagination. We will consider corresponding patterns in the natural world and other human endeavors in order to better understand our environment, our place in it, and the role of art in shaping our experiences.</p><p>Our work with progressive skill development will require physical immersion into the practices of listening, moving, and making music. Theory and literature studies will require the development of a common working vocabulary, writing skills, quantitative reasoning, and critical-thinking skills. Weekly activities will include readings, lectures, seminars, and interactive workshops designed to encourage students to expand and meld their creative interests within an intellectual infrastructure. Performance workshops will provide opportunities to gain firsthand understanding of fundamental skills and concepts as well as the transformative possibilities that exist through honest confrontation of challenging experiences. Writing workshops and assignments will encourage thoughtful consideration of a broad range of program topics. This balanced approach to the development of physical craft, artistry, and intellectual engagement is expected to culminate in a significant written and performance project.</p></description>

    <title>River Resources</title>
    <minimum_credits>16</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>16</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>River systems carry more than water. Rivers transfer energy, sediment, and dissolved materials; they modify the landscape; and they provide water and nutrients to ecosystems and agriculture. They act as corridors for the migration of fish, facilitate commerce, and attract recreation and development.</p><p>Because of the wide range of demands placed on rivers, laws and policies have been developed to limit and allocate how these resources can be used. Effective management of river resources is inherently interdisciplinary, requiring the application of knowledge in both environmental sciences and management. We will examine geology, hydrology, fluvial geomorphology, and aqueous chemistry, as well as environmental economics and benefit-cost analysis with an emphasis on the impacts of society on some natural river processes. Our modes of learning will include seminars, lectures, problem-solving workshops, science and geographic information systems (GIS) labs, project work, and field studies.</p><p>In winter, we will focus on natural-resource economics, physical geology, and surface-water hydrology, with the emphasis on quantitative problem solving. In addition, students will be introduced to GIS and develop skills in analyzing and displaying spatial data associated with river systems and drainage basins. We will take several daylong field trips to study local river systems in western Washington.</p><p>In spring quarter, we will turn our attention to fluvial geomorphology, aqueous chemistry, and benefit-cost analysis. Students will participate in project work, and participate in an extended field trip to the Columbia River Basin in eastern Washington.</p></description>

    <description><p>The goal of this program is for students to learn the intellectual concepts and skills that are essential for advanced work in computer science and beneficial for computing work in support of other disciplines. Students will have the opportunity to achieve a deeper understanding of increasingly complex computing systems by acquiring knowledge and skills in mathematical abstraction, problem solving, and the organization and analysis of hardware and software systems. The program covers material such as algorithms, data structures, computer organization and architecture, logic, discrete mathematics, and programming in the context of the liberal arts. The program is compatible with the model curriculum developed by the Association for Computing Machinery&apos;s Liberal Arts Computer Science Consortium.</p><p>Program content will be organized around four interwoven themes. The computational organization theme covers concepts and structures of computing systems from digital logic to the computer architecture and assembly language supporting high-level languages and operating systems. The programming theme concentrates on learning how to design and code programs to solve problems. The mathematical theme helps develop mathematical reasoning, theoretical abstractions, and problem-solving skills needed for computer scientists. The technology and society theme explores social, historical, and philosophical topics related to science and technology.</p><p>We will explore these themes throughout the program by way of lectures, programming labs, workshops, and seminars.</p></description>

    <title>Dance of Consciousness</title>
    <minimum_credits>16</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>16</maximum_credits>
    <description><p><em>&quot;It moves and moves not; It is far and likewise near. It is inside all this and It is outside all this.&quot; </em>— Isha Upanishad</p><p>The &quot;it&quot; that defies definition in this second-century BCE sacred text has become an equally perplexing focus of secular study—a “question that towers above all others,” according to <em>Scientific American</em>—in the contemporary life sciences. What is consciousness? Our inquiry will hold open this question within an intentional learning community for six months as we explore dance as metaphor and practice for how mystics as well as scholars, artists as well as scientists, experience the movement of consciousness.</p><p>If you really want to inquire about your experience of the movement of consciousness, this program is an invitation to explore its embodiment in relationship to Indian wisdom tradition. Specifically, we’ll practice Odissi dance and study our dreams as science and science as dream as manifestations of the dance of consciousness. Our work will include lectures, book seminars, films, workshops, introspective dream-journaling, and what an Evergreen faculty elder named “autobiomythography” in order to explore the multidimensional movements of consciousness. We&apos;ll consider anew mythic texts such as Gary Zukav’s <em>The Dancing Wu-Li Masters</em> and Fritjof Capra’s <em>The Tao of Physics</em> that bridge beliefs about East and West, mysticism and science, and that have formed consciousness studies from fields of inquiry such as psychology of dreams, ecofeminism, neurobiology, and quantum physics. Capra, after inquiring into his experience while sitting by the ocean, wrote: “I ‘saw’ cascades of energy coming down from outer space, in which particles were created and destroyed in rhythmic pulses; I ‘saw’ the atoms of the elements and those of my body participating in this cosmic dance of energy; I felt its rhythm and I ‘heard’ its sound, and at that moment I knew that this was the Dance of Shiva, the Lord of Dancers worshiped by the Hindus.&quot;</p><p>Students should expect to work 50 hours per week and perform at the end of fall quarter. During winter quarter, in lieu of dance, we will continue our studies of dreams and the nature of physical and mental reality.</p></description>

    <title>European Philosophy: 20th and 21st Century</title>
    <minimum_credits>16</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>16</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>This program will focus on the philosophy of language and phenomenology, covering the work of Wittgenstein, Husserl, Arendt, Heidegger, Merleau-Ponty, Derrida, and other 20th- and 21st-century European thinkers. Students will be expected to have some familiarity with the European philosophical tradition, and some experience reading and analyzing dense philosophical texts. The activities of the program will include close reading and analysis of primary texts within the context of their composition and the writing of reflective, argumentative, and synthetic essays in response to those texts. Students will be encouraged to explore connections between the theories developed in the program readings and their own social, political, and personal concerns.</p></description>

    <title>Studio Projects: Outside the Lines</title>
    <minimum_credits>16</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>16</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>The dominant concept of Euro-U.S. fine art holds that first and foremost, art serves the artist&apos;s self-expression. This assumption requires viewers of art to relinquish their own associations and experiences, and essentially submit to art’s &quot;power.&quot; Other theories suggest that art serves varied roles extending well beyond the artist’s self-expression. For millennia, indigenous and ancient cultures have created and used images and objects to serve ritual and ceremony, or to galvanize communities. Only recently have Euro-U.S. contemporary artists taken up alternative forms and functions—deploying art as a change agent, provoking examination of outmoded paradigms, and questioning the status quo. Images, objects, and experiences &quot;sneak up&quot; on us and surprise us. These works do so disguised as ordinary objects or images that we don’t initially perceive as art in the conventional sense. Such art appears in the guise of postcards and mail art, graphic novels, web zines, flip books, actions and performances, toys and other forms. In this program, we will question and explore the division between the purpose art has traditionally served and alternative ways art can operate. We will pursue this inquiry through multiple learning modes, including studio practice, contemporary art theory and art history lectures, screenings, readings, written assignments, individual creative projects, and seminars.</p><p>We will ground the program in two studio practices: animation and printmaking. Because both originate in drawing, students will devote significant time to learning drawing skills and theory. In fall, students will work back and forth between drawn and reproduced images, animation and intaglio printmaking, static and moving pictures. In winter, they will continue this process in addition to developing independent projects that further their own inquiries into these practices. Creating individual and collective projects, students will gain basic studio skills and foundational visual and media literacy. They will learn a range of creative concept development practices, enhancing their knowledge of alternative ways of making and thinking about art.</p></description>

    <title>Andean Roots: Linguistics and Ecological Agriculture</title>
    <minimum_credits>12, 16</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>12, 16</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>This program focuses on language, agriculture, and food systems with connections to broader themes of biocultural diversity and global change. Our studies are based on the belief that many cultures have developed rich linguistic and ecological traditions that have provided the means for communication, food, clothing, and shelter based on a sustainable relationship with the land. The program will focus on the Andean region of South America. The region&apos;s diverse geography, cultures, and languages—as well as the species domesticated there—offer an ideal case study for putting the program themes in context.</p><p>This is an interdisciplinary program that bridges social and natural sciences while incorporating qualitative, quantitative, and experiential modes of inquiry to acquire discipline-specific knowledge and skills in agroecology and linguistics using texts, lectures, workshops, film, writing, seminars, and field trips. In linguistics, we will study language structure, sociolinguistics, language and culture, and field methods, with particular attention given to English, Spanish, and Quechua in the U.S. and in Peru. In agroecology, we will study the structure and function of agricultural systems, farmer-to-farmer knowledge and seed networks, food storage and distribution systems, journal article analysis, field research methods, and agricultural biodiversity emphasizing species domesticated in the Andes. Together, we will compare the structure and functions of languages and agriculture, investigate the essential role of language in the retention of agricultural knowledge, and study how seeds are like words in the way they evolve over generations and are exchanged across cultures.</p><p>The program offers students seeking Beginning I or Beginning II Spanish language instruction the opportunity to take a 4-credit Spanish language course within the program. Students who do not need this option can enroll for 12 credits. </p></description>

    <title>Oral Traditions in Spain and Latin America</title>
    <minimum_credits>16</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>16</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>In this program, we will examine oral traditions that have flourished in the Spanish-speaking world from the Middle Ages to the present day. Through close reading and linguistic analysis of folktales, songs, and legends, we will explore the ongoing dialogue between artists of the spoken word across time and space, searching for a deeper understanding of the literary, historical, and cultural landscape of Spanish-speaking regions. Topics will include the <em>romances</em> about coexistence and conflict in medieval Spain; the syncretic folktales of colonial Mexico and the Caribbean; and today’s <em>corridos</em> about outlaws and drug-trafficking across the U.S.-Mexico border.</p><p>Students must have at least an intermediate level of Spanish to register for this program, since the program will be conducted entirely in Spanish. Our weekly schedule will include seminars, workshops, and lectures in Spanish, as well as sessions focusing on Spanish grammar and conversation. Students who take this program will have many opportunities to improve their Spanish language skills in speaking, reading, and writing, and can expect to refine their understanding of cultural forms in Spain and Latin America and their interrelationship with social and historical contexts. Assignments will include readings, essays, and creative writing in Spanish, as well as Spanish language exercises.</p></description>

    <title>Integrated Natural Science</title>
    <minimum_credits>16</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>16</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>This program offers an integrated study of general chemistry, physical and environmental geology, and general biology through the examination of concepts, theories, and structures that underlie the natural sciences. It is intended for students who are interested in pursuing more advanced coursework in biology, chemistry, ecology, and earth sciences at Evergreen. The origin and evolution of life on Earth, along with chemical and geological changes in the Earth itself, have been sources of fascination and controversy. This yearlong, interdisciplinary program will examine significant events in the history of life, the large-scale geologic changes that have occurred in Earth&apos;s history, and the key chemical processes involved. This approach will include the cycles and transformations of matter and energy in living and nonliving systems, affording an opportunity to gain an understanding of biological, chemical, and physical Earth processes on a variety of scales. The nature of living organisms will be examined on molecular, cellular, and physiological levels within the context of their evolutionary history. Chemical topics of equilibria, thermodynamics, and kinetics will provide a framework to understand biological and ecological systems. Students will engage with these themes using an experimental approach to develop critical and quantitative reasoning skills.</p><p>Fall quarter will integrate topics of biology, chemistry, and geology through the study of early Earth history. Molecular structure and properties will enhance our understanding of biological function at the molecular level. These will be covered through the study of genetics and inheritance, structure and synthesis of DNA and proteins, and how these molecules are integrated into cells. In winter quarter, we will continue to move forward in geologic time, providing students an opportunity to apply their knowledge while adding layers of complexity to their investigations. Chemical concepts of kinetics and equilibria will enhance our geological studies. Biology content will focus on a more organismal level by examining important concepts in animal developmental biology, reproduction, and physiology. In spring quarter, we will examine equilibrium reactions in greater depth and begin our study of thermodynamics. We will further examine evolutionary processes on a macro level through the study of plants, diversification of life, and ecology. A field trip to eastern Washington will provide opportunities for students to experience the natural world by applying lab and field skills they learned throughout the program to project work.</p><p>Program activities will include lectures, small group problem-solving workshops, laboratories, field work, and a field trip in spring.</p><p>This program is designed for students who want a solid preparation for further study in the sciences. Students who only want to get a taste of science will find this program especially demanding and should consult with faculty before the program begins. Overall, we expect students to end the program in spring with a working knowledge of scientific, mathematical, and computational concepts, ability to reason critically and to solve problems, and with hands-on experience in natural science. Students will also gain a strong appreciation of the interconnectedness of biological and physical systems, and an ability to apply this knowledge to complex problems.</p></description>

    <description><p>How can we think analytically and critically about crime in America? Why is crime such a central focus in modern American society? How is a crime scene analyzed? How are crimes solved? How can we prevent violent crime and murder? This program will integrate sociological and forensic science perspectives in order to investigate crime and societal responses to it. We will explore how social and cultural factors including race, class, and gender are associated with crime and criminal behavior. In addition, we will consider criminological theories and explore how social scientists can help identify offenders through criminal profiling and forensic psychology.</p><p>Through our forensics investigations, we will learn biology, chemistry, pathology, and physics. We will study evidentiary techniques for crime scene analysis, such as the examination of fingerprints, DNA, blood spatter, fibers, glass fractures and fragments, hairs, ballistics, teeth, bones, and body remains. Students will learn hands-on laboratory and field approaches to the scientific methods used in crime scene investigation. They will also learn to apply analytical, quantitative, and qualitative skills to the collection and interpretation of evidence. Students can expect seminars, labs, lectures, guest speakers, and workshops, along with both individual and group project work.</p><p>This is an introductory program about science; critical thinking; and the perspectives of sociology, chemistry, and biology as applied to crime analysis. Students interested in developing their skills in scientific inquiry, critical thinking, and interdisciplinary studies should consider this program. Students who may not consider themselves to be &quot;science&quot; students are encouraged to enroll.</p></description>

    <title>Ecological and Environmental Economics</title>
    <minimum_credits>16</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>16</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>This advanced social science program examines the methods and applications of ecological and environmental economics for environmental problem solving. The major goal of the program is to make students familiar and comfortable with the methodologies, language, concepts, models, and applications of ecological and environmental economic analysis. The program does not assume an extensive background in economics; therefore, it begins by quickly reviewing selected micro economic principles. We will study the models used in natural resource management, pollution control approaches, and sustainability as an empirical criterion in policy development. We will explore externalities, market failure, and intergenerational equity in depth. Examples of case studies we will evaluate include natural resources in the Pacific Northwest; management and restoration of the Pacific salmon stocks and other marine resources; energy issues including traditional, alternative, and emerging impacts from hydraulic fracturing (fracking), oil trains, and climate change; selected issues of environmental law; wetland and critical areas protection and mitigation; and emerging threats such as ocean acidification and low-oxygen zones. We also will develop a detailed consideration of the theory and practice of benefit-cost analysis. The program concludes by critically evaluating the strengths and weaknesses of using ecological and environmental economics to develop solutions to environmental problems.</p><p>Program activities include lectures, seminars, research and methods workshops, field trips, quizzes, exams, and a research assignment.</p></description>

    <title>Scientific Explorations in Chemistry and Archaeology</title>
    <minimum_credits>16</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>16</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>Though mass media portrays archaeologists as poison-arrow-ducking, Nazi-foiling adventurers, the truth is that archaeologists are scientists—and they often spend more time in the lab than finding the Ark of the Covenant. This program trains students to be such scientists. Incorporating archaeology, chemistry, math, research, and project presentation (written, oral, and visual), we seek to teach students all stages of the scientific method, from gathering data to presenting original research at conferences.</p><p>The study will benefit students who are looking for general chemistry credits and who have an interest in archaeology. No previous experience in chemistry or archaeology is required, but students should be able to use a scientific calculator and have completed high school algebra. High school precalculus is strongly recommended.</p><p>In the fall, students will review precalculus and algebra, begin studies and laboratory experiments in general chemistry, and learn about basic archaeological principles, methods, and field work in Washington state. In the winter, students will continue to learn general chemistry with laboratory and will be taught archaeological recording and lab methods. By spring quarter, students will be prepared to conduct original research on archaeological finds, such as chemical component analysis of artifacts. Students will also be prepared to design and present a research poster on their topics. Depending on students’ research topics, spring quarter may include participation in the Northwest Anthropological Conference, the Washington State Undergraduate Research Symposium, or the Evergreen Science Carnival. Seminar readings throughout the year will focus especially on issues of social justice in the sciences, as well as ethics in science.</p></description>

    <title>Earth and Sky: Climate and Change</title>
    <minimum_credits>16</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>16</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>The Earth’s atmosphere and oceans are affected by human activities, the sun, and geologic activity. Over many millions of years, the Earth has experienced wide fluctuations in climate—from ice ages to very warm periods. Earth is currently experiencing an unusually rapid warming trend, due to anthropogenic (human-caused) changes in atmospheric composition. Historically, a major factor determining global climate has been the intensity of the sun&apos;s energy reaching the Earth. However, climate changes cannot be explained by variations in solar radiation alone. We will focus on the role of the sun and greenhouse gases in regulating Earth’s climate, examine climate records to understand how and why climate has varied in the past, and consider studies modeling how climate change will occur into the future.</p><p>Interactions between oceans and atmosphere affect the composition of both, and oceans impact global climate by redistributing the sun&apos;s energy. What is the evidence for causes of contemporary global warming? What are the expected consequences? What can be done? What about proposed schemes to engineer solutions to global warming, such as the sequestration of anthropogenic carbon into the deep sea? We will study diverse and interconnected physical, chemical, geological, and biological processes. This requires a basic understanding of chemistry and facility with algebra. No physics prerequisite.</p><p>Students will learn through lectures, workshops, laboratories, and seminars, often using primary scientific literature. Students will do significant teamwork and will research questions that particularly interest them. We will have weekly online assignments, so students should be comfortable using computers and the internet.</p></description>

    <description><p>This upper-division chemistry program offers advanced studies in chemistry to prepare students for graduate studies or careers in chemistry. Based on the theme &quot;what do chemists do?&quot;, our classroom studies will be connected with the applications chemists encounter in their everyday work.</p><p>In the fall, we will study topics in quantum mechanics and descriptive inorganic chemistry. We will study simple quantum mechanical systems, apply them to solve simple chemical problems, and investigate how they can be adapted for more complex systems. In inorganic chemistry, we will explore atomic structure, simple bonding models, molecular symmetry, group theory and its applications, molecular orbital theory, and acid-base chemistry.</p><p>In the winter quarter, we will continue our studies in quantum mechanics to include more complex systems and investigate the use of spectroscopy to validate the quantum mechanical theories. Inorganic chemistry topics will include the study of coordination compounds and the solid state. In addition, we will begin our study of thermodynamics by exploring the laws that lay the foundation in this field of study.</p><p>The spring quarter will find us doing in-depth investigations of the spectrometric methods including a detailed analysis of the high-resolution infrared spectrum of a diatomic molecule. We will continue our studies in thermodynamics with topics in chemical equilibria and kinetics.</p><p>In the laboratory, students will work with a selection of analytical instrumentation available at the college. This will include an exploration of the physical principles as well as analysis of samples. Students are strongly encouraged to work with individual chemistry faculty on research projects during the course of the year. The results of these projects will be presented at the annual Undergraduate Research Symposium of the Puget Sound Section of the American Chemical Society and at the annual Evergreen Science Carnival &amp; Research Exposition.</p></description>

    <description><p>
      The full-time program
      <a href="http://www.evergreen.edu/catalog/2017-18/programs/atomsmoleculesandreactions-16395">Atoms, Molecules, and Reactions</a>
      covers quantum mechanics, inorganic chemistry (in fall and winter), and thermodynamics (in winter and spring), all at the upper-division science level. Each of these subjects is available to students as an individual component by taking a partial-credit option within
      <a href="http://www.evergreen.edu/catalog/2017-18/programs/atomsmoleculesandreactions-16395">Atoms, Molecules, and Reactions</a>
      .
    </p><p>In the fall quarter of the quantum mechanics component, topics will include history and origins of quantum theory, wave-particle duality of light, Heisenberg&apos;s uncertainty principle, operators, the Schrödinger equation, particle in a box, harmonic oscillator, rigid rotor, hydrogen-like atoms, angular momenta, Zeeman effect, variation method, multi-electron atoms, and application of the Pauli exclusion principle.</p><p>
      In winter, we will extend our studies to learn Slater determinants, Hartree-Fock self-consistent field method, atomic term symbols, spin-orbit coupling, atomic spectra, Born-Oppenheimer approximation, application of quantum mechanics to diatomics, potential energy diagrams, confocal elliptic coordinates, molecular term symbols, hybridization model, Hückel
      <span>molecular orbital</span>
       theory, rotational spectroscopy, vibrational spectroscopy, vibration-rotation spectra of diatomics, and an introduction to Raman spectroscopy.
    </p><p>In spring, we will conclude our exploration in quantum mechanics with electronic spectroscopy, the Franck-Condon principle, fluorescence, phosphorescence, and lasers. Students will analyze the vibration-rotation spectrum of the HBr molecule and the visible spectrum of iodine to obtain molecular parameters and present them in two formal lab reports to demonstrate their ability to extract atomic and molecular parameters from the spectra.</p></description>

    <title>Odd Jobs and Labors of Love: Literature, Work, and Power</title>
    <minimum_credits>8</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>8</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>Whether we experience it as just a job or as a labor of love, the work we do has a profound effect on every aspect of our lives. Yet we seldom treat the literature about work seriously, let alone think critically about power relationships in a landscape of employment that is turbulent and changing. Fortunately, memoirs, novels, and poems can help us unveil the many social and personal truths embedded in our work experiences. This is a literature full of tragedy and hilarity, imagination and insight; it&apos;s one that can empower us to forge new and more meaningful relationships with this central activity in our lives.</p><p>In this program, we’ll approach the literature and sociology of work together, examining the ways in which modern work is changing and the ways it differs across time and culture. Both literary and sociological sources will help us to see how work not only shapes our individual identities, but also affects how we’re perceived and valued (or devalued) by others. We’ll have a chance to view our individual (and sometimes isolating) experiences in broader contexts. No job is too humble to be a starting place for such an investigation. Students will pursue their new understandings by means of written responses, research, bibliographic writing, and autobiographical accounts of their own work experiences.</p></description>

    <title>The Word in the Ear: Finnegans Wake and Other Experiments in Music and Language</title>
    <minimum_credits>8, 16</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>8, 16</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>The sound of the name and the name of the sound: James Joyce, Gem&apos;s Choice, Jam&apos;s Jice … Assonance? Or just asses?</p><p>Every word has its sound … every sentence its melody … every paragraph its halitosis.</p><p>(Halitosis? That doesn&apos;t fit. And why not? Did the rhythm set you up, then trick you? Or is halitosis a new literary form you&apos;ve not heard of? Does the meaning override the sense, or does the rhythm override the meaning?)</p><p>
      Are there texts that do
      <em>not</em>
      cry out to be read aloud? How do texts resist their corruption into voice? When does the music overpower the meaning and render it trivial?
    </p><p>Does the voice of a survivor of violence get drowned out by the noise of the musical beat? Does the beat strengthen that voice and what that individual has to say, or does it render its words and their meanings irrelevant?</p><p>Or is the meaning of the text helplessly open to corruption by the music?</p><p>It&apos;s easy to imagine a text rendered irrelevant by its music, but could a text be so powerful as to render its music irrelevant? Can creative artists combine the strength of the text with that of the music without having one distort the aims of the other?</p><p>
      These and other questions will be addressed in the class, along with weekly readings from Joyce&apos;s
      <em>Finnegans Wake</em>
      and other texts. We&apos;ll learn, try out, and perform ways of reading the text, and explore ways of extracting melodies from a text. Some of the writers we&apos;ll be exploring are François Villon,
      <span>François </span>
      Rabelais, Gertrude Stein, T.S. Eliot, Aimé Césaire, James Baldwin, and Sylvia Plath.
    </p><p>
      All students, whether enrolled for 8 or 16 credits, will meet for
      <em>Experiments in Loud Out Reading</em>
      and for seminar discussions and experiments. Students will be asked to give three presentations, both solo and in small groups, and present to the class the result(s) of their work. Students enrolled for the 16-credit option will attend additional sessions to explore music compositions and experiments in sound. Students in these sessions will write compositions for solo and multiple voices. We&apos;ll also listen to compositions written for voice, and explorations of what the voice can do, from Luigi Nono, Susan Parenti, Arnold Schoenberg, Rick Burkhardt, and others. In addition to the composition assignments, each student will be asked to write a paper that analyzes one of the pieces studied in the class.

    <description><p>What does it mean to like something or <i>someone</i>? What informs our seemingly personal sensibilities, feelings, emotions, passions, tastes, sentiments, desires, and preferences about the people in our lives and the things in our material world? What brings us pleasure, what revolts us, and why? And how are our desires and passions linked to identity construction and matters of social distinction, stigma, and social hierarchy?</p><p>In this program, we will draw on anthropology, social psychology, history, and social theory to answer these and other questions about matters of taste. Through serious consideration of scholarly works and our own embodied experiences, we will focus on the enculturation and cultivation of particular sensibilities, looking at the interplay of pleasure and power in the United States and in other cultural contexts. In doing so, we will pay attention to what entices and what offends, for whom, with whom, when, and why. Questions of subjectivity and difference lie at the core of the inquiry, as well as the possibility of shared perceptions—locally or universally—of fragrance and stench, resonance and discord, splendor and repulsiveness.</p><p>Two major modes of social scientific inquiry will be taught and utilized in this program: ethnography (the primary research method within cultural anthropology) and experimental quantitative research studies (social psychology). Students will learn the principles of research design and analysis in each of these two social scientific research methodologies in the fall quarter, including some introductory statistics. In the winter, students will design and conduct their own independent or collaborative research studies on sensibilities and/or emotions, focusing on utilizing one of the two methods learned in the fall. The program will provide intermediate-level grounding in cultural anthropology and social psychology; introduce perspectives in sociology, history, philosophy, and sociolinguistics; and help prepare students to complete capstone projects in critical and interpretive social sciences.</p></description>

    <title>Ecology of Perennial Agricultural Systems</title>
    <minimum_credits>16</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>16</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>This field-based program will provide students with practical tools to understand perennial-based agricultural systems in the Pacific Northwest by exploring the ecological relationships between perennial crops, ruminant livestock, and the land. Pacific Northwest agriculture is predominantly based on perennial plants—with livestock forages covering the largest acreage, and berry and tree fruit crops having the highest commercial value. Students will analyze the regional distribution and management of livestock forages, hops, nuts, berries, and tree fruits in relation to climate, topography, soils, and water availability. We will learn practical identification, morphology, physiology, and production of select species. The suitability of perennial forages as ruminant livestock feed will be learned in relation to ruminant nutrition, foraging behavior, and digestive physiology. We will also explore the potential and challenges of integrating diverse perennials and livestock in terms of nutrient cycling and management compatibility.</p><p>Classroom lectures, workshops, and guest speakers will be paired with weekly field trips to observe perennials and ruminants on working farms. There will be an overnight trip to the Willamette Valley, where we will study managed intensive grazing dairy operations; forage production; and hazelnut production. There will also be an overnight trip to eastern Washington to learn about hops, grapes, and fruit trees. Student learning will be assessed through classroom and field notebooks, weekly homework assignments, and in-class quizzes.</p></description>

    <title>Speaking Truth in 20th- and 21st-Century Indigenous Arts: Legacy, Defiance, and Agency</title>
    <minimum_credits>16</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>16</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>Across the millennia, indigenous peoples have always had means of expressing their lives through art. Non-Natives, however, as recently as the 20th century, have viewed indigenous artwork through a framework of colonizing artistic standards. These standards often ignored, misrepresented, misinterpreted, and sometimes denigrated the artworks of Native peoples. The purpose of this program is to view 20th- and 21st-century indigenous arts through indigenous frameworks that honor the continuity of cultural traditions, while also respecting the power of agency Native artists have exercised against a backdrop of ongoing colonization. Art is testimony to the vibrancy of indigenous worldviews that often “speak truth” on the ravages of colonization in their communities and homelands, as well as the narrow constructions of U.S. history and anthropology that limit deeper understanding.</p><p>In this program, we will critically examine some of the colonizing aspects of U.S./Native history, anthropology, and the tourist industry that motivated many mid-20th and early 21st-century indigenous artists to “speak truth” through paintings, sculptures, carvings, basketry, bead work, photography, prints, performance, and multimedia installations as a means of maintaining and defending Native identity and tribal sovereignty. Using a decolonizing lens, we will analyze some of the artworks across the century that were reduced to anthropological artifacts and “crafts” as objects of study, rather than recognized or respected for the aesthetically creative and artistic works that they really are. Through lectures, films, readings by indigenous scholars and writers, student-led seminars, guest speakers, weekly studio or research workshops, and field trips to mainstream and tribal museums, students will critically reflect on the power, meaning, and contributions of contemporary Native art, not only to indigenous people, but to the non-Native world. Students will develop skills as writers, artists, researchers, and potential allies by studying indigenous scholarship and the artworks of indigenous artists from the 20th and 21st centuries, and by developing research papers and presentations.</p></description>

    <title>Media Internships</title>
    <minimum_credits>16</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>16</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>This program is the home for Evergreen media internships. Media internships provide advanced students with opportunities to gain deep knowledge of specific media concepts and skills in the context of a tightly knit cohort who collaborate on developing academic and creative research agendas that parallel and are informed by their work as interns. Internships involve about 30 hours per week for 12–14 credits per quarter and are available in animation/imaging, audio, Media Loan, multimedia lab, music technology, production, video production, and video post-production. Interns gain and strengthen instructional, technical, research, organizational, leadership, communication, and collaborative skills as they work with the supervising staff associated with each of these areas to support instruction, maintenance, and administration of facilities, and to fulfill campus production needs.</p><p>
      The Media Internship program includes 2-4 credits of academic inquiry per quarter that will involve individual research in the critical history of specific media technologies with an emphasis on the social, cultural, and economic influences on their development and adoption by both mainstream and alternative producers. As students expand their practical and theoretical knowledge of media technologies, they will examine their own roles as producers, artists, teachers, and leaders through reflective writing and the production of both individual and collaborative creative media projects. Interns meet weekly as a group with staff or faculty to share skills; seminar on readings or screenings; peer-review writing; and collaborate on projects, productions, and cross-training in all Media Services areas.
      <br/>
      The Media Internship program requires a yearlong commitment from fall through spring quarters. For more details, including information about each specific internship, prerequisites for them, and how to apply, please refer to

    <title>The Evolution of Constitutional Law Beyond the 20th Century</title>
    <minimum_credits>16</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>16</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>What does it mean when we say the Constitution of the United States is a living document? What are the major shifts in U.S. Supreme Court doctrine? How have the First Amendment speech and religion clauses expanded and encompassed corporations and money as speech? How have women’s reproductive rights been eroded to the extent that, based on their personal religious beliefs, some employers can refuse to provide to their employees health insurance that includes birth control coverage? What are the legal issues raised by current immigration cases?</p><p>In this program, we will ask these and related questions as we explore the landscape of judicial review in the 21st century. We will look for answers to our questions by exploring a number of substantive issues currently raised in the courts by the people and their representatives. These issues include higher education student debt, economic disparities and taxation, availability and access to health care insurance, reproductive rights, voting rights, immigration, age discrimination, the criminal justice system, ideals of equal justice under the law, and others.</p><p>Lectures, readings, and discussions will examine constitutional theories and legal construction of selected cases, with a particular focus on the currently sitting Roberts Court. Students and faculty will review legal precedents related to constitutional doctrines raised by the Supreme Court’s interpretations of the law, established in its decisions, and analyzed and discussed by the legal community in law review articles and related academic periodicals. The program will employ the Socratic method to explore and examine students’ abilities to “think like a lawyer,” thereby deepening critical thinking and reasoning. Additionally, it is expected that students will acquire an enhanced knowledge of when and how precedents have evolved.</p><p>Students will conduct legal research on specific issues that will include legal history on constitutional evolution and federal statutes. Through this process, students will expand understanding of precedents and recent U.S. Supreme Court decisions impacting rights and responsibilities of citizens.</p><p>Concomitant with program content and research, students will prepare and demonstrate knowledge of constitutional law and legislative history by participating in moot court activities. Students will be placed in teams to research and present written and oral arguments on a selected topic for the Evergreen moot court competition. As part of this process, students will write legal memoranda and briefs on the case presented before the moot court. In preparing for moot court, students will be instructed, coached, and judged by Evergreen faculty as well as lawyers and judges outside of the Evergreen community.</p></description>

    <title>Feminist Jurisprudence</title>
    <minimum_credits>16</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>16</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>Feminist jurisprudence is a philosophy of law based on the political, economic, and social equality of the sexes. Students will be introduced to various schools of thought and concepts of inequality in the law spanning historical periods from the 1920s (ratification of the 19th Amendment) to the present. Students will investigate historical foundations of gender inequality as well as the history of legal attempts to address that inequality, including U.S. Supreme Court cases; federal laws, including Title VII and Title IX; and feminist jurisprudence. Lectures and discussions will include topics on the development of the constitutional standard for sex equality, legal feminism from the 1970s to the present incorporating work and family, as well as home and workplace conflicts. Students and faculty will review legal precedents related to feminist jurisprudence raised by the Supreme Court’s interpretations of the law and analyzed and discussed by the legal community in law review articles and related academic research. </p><p>Issues presented by the cases will include, among others: women as lawyers, women and reproduction, prostitution, surrogacy and reproductive technology, women and partner violence, pornography, sexual harassment, taxation, gender and athletics. Students will also examine current and historical documents on inequality and legal issues that continue to impact women. Intersections of gender and race will also be critically analyzed.</p><p>The Socratic method and lectures will be the principal modes of instruction. Student panel presentations on assigned topics/cases will contribute to new knowledge and an enhanced understanding of feminist jurisprudence and its place in the historical development of women’s rights and responsibilities. </p><p>In addition to panel presentations, students will be required to produce legal memoranda, journals, and a final research project submitted in one of the following forms: a well-documented research paper/article on feminist jurisprudence, an art/graphics project reflecting historical or current women’s legal issues, or a forum on a specific feminist legal issue/topic, among others.</p></description>

    <title>Modes of Sensory Perception: Evolution and Mechanisms</title>
    <minimum_credits>16</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>16</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>How have animals come to use photons, organic molecules, and electricity to interpret and navigate their world? How do the mechanisms of chemical signaling translate into the experience of taste—a ripe strawberry, a freshly brewed cup of coffee, a hot pepper? Why are primates so visually dominant, while other mammals rely more heavily on smell? How and why have birds created song—and what does birdsong share with human music and language?</p><p>In this program, we will be exploring modes of sensory perception at two different levels. With the tools of evolutionary biology, we will investigate how the ecology and deep history of different animal species, including humans, has led to distinctive modes of detection and transduction. How has selection acted on organisms that live in noisy or visually cluttered environments; what senses dominate in aquatic, terrestrial, or arboreal habitats? By using molecular and cell biology, we want to understand the processes by which information from the world around us activates specialized neurons within sensory organs, and how those signals are transmitted to the brain to create particular sensations.</p><p>In fall quarter, we will begin with an overview of the functional organization of the central nervous system and the concept of electrical signaling. We will concentrate on elements of the visual system, including the detection of light, contrast, and color, and study clades that have a particularly high reliance on vision. In winter quarter, we will introduce the principles of genetics and molecular biology and the concept of chemical signaling. We will concentrate on the senses of taste and smell, exploring connections to food and flavor profiles. In spring quarter, we will concentrate on the sense of hearing, and expand our inquiry to vocalization, language, and music. We anticipate reading such authors as David Hubel, Oliver Sacks, Sidney Mintz, Jared Diamond, Guy Deutscher, Barbara Ehrenreich, and Salman Rushdie. This is a rigorous program involving lectures, workshops, seminars, and laboratory and field work. Student learning will be assessed by exams, seminar writing assignments, and research papers.</p></description>

    <title>The Graphic Novel</title>
    <minimum_credits>8</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>8</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>In recent years, graphic novels have become recognized as an important form of storytelling, shaping contemporary culture even as they are shaped by it. These book-length, comic-art narratives and compilations employ a complex and iconic visual language. Combining and expanding on elements associated with literature, 2-D visual art, and cinema, the comics medium offers unique opportunities for reader immersion, emotional involvement, and even imaginative co-creation.</p><p>In this program, we will study sequential narratives that represent diverse periods, perspectives, styles, and subject matter—from groundbreaking works of the 1980s (<em>Watchmen</em> and <em>Maus</em>) to women’s memoirs (<em>Fun Home</em> and <em>One Hundred Demons</em>) to the radical evocations of time and space in Richard McGuire’s <em>Here</em>. We will carefully examine each text at multiple levels of composition, from single frames to the work as a whole, and read selected theory, criticism, and commentary, including Scott McCloud’s seminal <em>Understanding Comics</em> and Matt Madden’s ingenious <em>99 Ways to Tell a Story</em>. As writers, students will develop and articulate their new understandings by means of response papers, visual analyses, bibliographic summaries, and other activities as assigned.</p><p>Our studies will conclude with final projects focused on particular artists, works, and themes, or on the creation of original graphic narratives. Finally, while this is not a studio art course, we will experiment with drawing throughout the program as a way to develop an artist’s-eye view of comic art. Our overall goal is to develop an informed and critical perspective on this powerful medium.</p></description>

    <title>Marine Biology and Maritime Literature</title>
    <minimum_credits>16</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>16</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>This program will examine the diversity of Earth&apos;s oceans and use the ocean and its inhabitants as sources of inspiration in literature. Our goal is to build a solid understanding of introductory marine biology and develop our abilities to write in styles appropriate to several creative genres, including short stories, nonfiction, poetry, and other literary forms. The ocean has inspired a diverse group of authors to compose creative pieces, and seminars will explore these works across a wide variety of genres and diverse marine ecosystems. Our marine studies will focus on the organisms that live in the ocean and their ecological interactions. Laboratory work will introduce students to foundational skills needed to carry out studies in marine biology. We will conduct various field studies in Puget Sound, and take a weeklong field trip to the coast of the Olympic Peninsula to observe marine organisms in their natural habitat and provide opportunities for reflective creative work. Through weekly workshops, students will hone their abilities to write creatively and analyze quantitative data. Students will be evaluated through their writing assignments, exams, quizzes, laboratory exercises, and notebooks, as well as through their participation in seminars and workshops.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> In order to provide another entry point for students at all levels interested in literature and marine biology, this program will explore many of the same topics as the fall-winter Creative Oceans program. This is <em>not</em> a continuation of Creative Oceans.</p></description>

    <title>Remix Reverse Remediate</title>
    <minimum_credits>16</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>16</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>This advanced, coordinated studies program delves into a range of models and approaches to remixing as an aesthetic method for argumentation, satire, and criticism, including sampling, poaching, adaptation, parody, détournement, and culture jamming. A remix is a text composed by recombining and/or altering elements of other texts. Most commonly applied to songs and videos since the term’s origins in &apos;60s and &apos;70s club music, the idea of remixing also encompasses a long legacy of collective, intertextual, or recombinatory art.</p><p>In this program, we will explore the theoretical underpinnings of appropriation as a praxis, interrogate authorship and originality, and learn about the historical emergence of intellectual property and feminist/postcolonial interventions into the concept. Our objects will include transformative video and literary works by both artists and vernacular creators (fans, activists) that act to re/mediate, re/verse, and re/mix media as a form of critical social practice and irreverent collaboration. How do collages or cut-ups draw out nascent potentials and obscured or problematic aspects of their source texts? We will also do our own collaborative composing and experimental remixing, enacting several writing and film/video editing exercises toward generating our own critical-creative contestations. This cycle will include re/moving, re/combining, and re/shaping as modalities.</p></description>

    <title>Diversity and Dissent in Education and the Media</title>
    <minimum_credits>16</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>16</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>As communities continue to reflect the country&apos;s increasingly diverse population, what media representations challenge and support discrimination in our communities, schools, and institutions? How can we generate a framework for actions that reject inaccurate representations of human difference, value diverse forms of knowledge, and question institutional inequalities? In this program, we will pursue answers to these questions by examining identity, educational history, cultural studies, and the media in order to design strategies to support a more equitable school system and to create diverse forms of media expression.</p><p>We will begin by analyzing a working definition of racism and sexism that frames intentional, as well as unintentional, normalized acts of inequality over time. We will challenge depictions in literature and the media that promote the stereotyping of diverse groups. Through an analysis of anti-racist and anti-sexist case study research and the media, we will also explore the lived experiences of diverse populations whose identities are often impacted by assumptions and disparities found in communities and school settings based upon the social construction of race and gender and the stereotyping of immigrant students. In order to break down such assumptions, students will engage in community service, writing, and media analysis over the course of the program.</p><p>In the fall community service will take the form of engagement in student groups at Evergreen, followed by collaborations with community-based organizations in winter. In addition we will investigate specific everyday actions that media artists, activists, and educators generate to confront these inequalities. By incorporating media and writing workshops with qualitative research methods such as interviews and participant observation, we will collect various sources of data and present our work that documents how specific counter-narratives can be created that affirm and support diverse learners to achieve within their schools and communities. Writing workshops will help students develop skills in critical analysis and media analysis, while media workshops (which may include photography, digital video, and new media) will help students develop skills in visual literacy and expression.</p><p>Lastly, we will demonstrate our understanding of everyday anti-racist/anti-sexist practices by creating presentations that merge theory, community service, and writing. Possible themes that may emerge through our own study include examining the community and students&apos; funds of knowledge, as well as the use of alternative media outlets and the arts as tools of empowerment that specifically recognize our collective cultural hybridity.</p></description>

    <description><p>Do you want to produce food for yourself, your family, and others in your community? What does it take to grow food and feed yourself and others every day throughout the year? This three-quarter program (spring, summer, and fall) will explore details of sustainable food production systems using the three pillars of sustainability—economic, environmental, and social justice—as our lens. Our focus will be on small-scale organic production, but we will compare and contrast that system to other production systems. We will cover the scientific underpinnings of sustainable and organic food production, critical thinking, and observation skills necessary to grow food using ecologically informed methods. In addition, we will explore the farm management and business skills necessary to operate a small-scale farm.</p><p>We will be studying and working at the Evergreen Organic Farm through an entire growing season, from seed propagation to harvest, and on to market. The farm includes a small-scale, direct-market stand and CSA, as well as a variety of other demonstration areas. All students will work on the farm every week to gain practical experiential learning. This program is rigorous physically and academically and requires a willingness to work outside in adverse weather on a schedule determined by the needs of crops and animals.</p><p>During spring quarter we will focus on soil science, nutrient management, and crop botany. Additional topics will include introduction to animal husbandry, successional crop planning, season extension, and the principles and practice of composting. In summer, main topics will be disease and pest management, which includes entomology, plant pathology, and weed biology. Water management, irrigation system design, maximizing market and value-added opportunities, and regulatory issues will be covered. Fall&apos;s focus will be on farm and business planning, crop physiology, storage techniques, seed-saving practices, and cover crops. Additional topics covered throughout the program will include record keeping for organic production systems, alternative crop production systems, techniques for adding value to farm and garden products, hand-tool use and maintenance, and farm equipment safety. We will also cover the communication and conflict-resolution skills needed to work effectively in small groups.</p><p>Topics will be explored through on-farm workshops, seminar discussions, lectures, laboratory exercises, and field trips. Expect weekly reading and writing assignments, extensive collaborative group work, and a variety of hands-on projects. The final project in fall will be a detailed farm and business plan that integrates all the topics covered in the program. Books may include <em>The Market Gardener</em> by Fortier and <em>Building Soils for Better Crops</em> by Magdoff and van Es.</p><p>Students who need to request disability accommodation should contact the faculty or Access Services Program Coordinator <a href="mailto:schmidts@evergreen.edu">Steve Schmidt</a> at L2153 or call (360)867-6348; TTY 360.867.6834 prior to the start of the quarter.

    <description><p><strong>Note: This is the third quarter of a spring-summer-fall program.</strong></p><p>What does it take to be successful at farming? This program, formerly titled Practice of Sustainable Agriculture, spans three quarters (spring, summer, and fall) and can help you answer this question and more. The program will explore the knowledge and skills needed to be successful in organic farming and food-production systems using the underlying sciences as a framework. Due to the interdisciplinary nature of agriculture, the various topical threads (plant science, soils, horticulture, animal husbandry, organic regulations, business, etc.) will be presented throughout all three quarters, and our primary focus will be on small-scale, direct-market, organic production. We will emphasize the scientific underpinnings and practical applications critical for growing food using ecologically informed methods, along with the management and business skills appropriate for small-scale production.</p><p>We will study and work at the Evergreen Organic Farm through an entire growing season, from starting seed to selling farm products and preparing the farm for winter. All students will work on the farm every week to gain practical experiential learning. This program is rigorous both physically and academically and requires a willingness to work outside in adverse weather on a schedule determined by the needs of crops and animals raised on the farm.</p><p>Topics will follow activities on the farm throughout the growing season. During spring quarter, our primary focus will be exploring soil and plant sciences, gaining quantitative skills, and developing a working knowledge of the yearly planning documents that guide the organic farm. Beginning with the organic system plan and the farm crop plan, we will study documents and record-keeping systems needed to guide our work throughout the growing season. In summer, the main focus will be integrated pest management for insects, weeds, and diseases. Marketing, water management, irrigation system design, and regulatory issues will also be covered. Fall quarter&apos;s focus will be on farm and business planning and cover crops.</p><p>The farm practicum provides students with the opportunity to integrate theory with the practice of farming. Students will learn the various elements and systems of the farm and hands-on skills throughout the growing season. These skills and topics will include livestock care, greenhouse management, crop establishment and management (seeding, transplanting, irrigating, weeding, harvesting, marketing), monitoring for pests and diseases, equipment maintenance and repair, and composting. Students will also learn how to market produce through community-supported agriculture, as well as a market stand.</p><p>If you are a student with a disability and would like to request accommodation, please contact the faculty or Access Services at L2153, or call (360) 867-6348; TTY (360) 867-6834 prior to the start of the quarter. If you require accessible transportation for field trips, please contact faculty well in advance of field trip dates to allow time to arrange this.</p></description>

    <title>What Are Schools For?</title>
    <minimum_credits>16</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>16</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>Schools are contested institutions in our country. For some, they are a means for learning and mobility; for others they are “sorting machines” that maintain social inequality. While every member of our society is promised a good education, there are ongoing inequalities that are fueled by race, class, and gender. In this program we will investigate these contradictions from pedagogical, psychological, philosophical, cultural, and historical perspectives.</p><p>Central to our study will be an investigation of how children learn. To do so, we will draw insights from developmental psychology, educational philosophy, and learning theory. We will study theorists such as John Dewey, Lev Vygotsky, Paulo Freire, and Maxine Greene. We will also draw on literature, history, and anthropology to explore the variations in learning that are a result of culture and other environmental variables, through attention to researchers like Shirley Brice Heath and Annette Lareau. From this study, we will seek to create a framework in which we can consider questions of relevant academic content, methods of teaching, ways of learning, and overall educational aims.</p><p>We will broaden our investigation of schooling by considering its role in maintaining cultural values and the purposes of education within a diverse, multicultural society. To do so we will look at the history of teacher preparation, subjects included in the curriculum, testing, the membership and role of school boards, state and federal regulations, and the reform movements of the last 20 years. We will pay special attention to the growing alignment of schooling to the values of the economy and the business community.</p><p>Writing and field study will be prominent. Academic and reflective writing will make up a core activity within the program. Students can expect to write often and to participate in structured writing-feedback groups; students can also expect to revise pieces to increase power and depth in academic or reflective modes. Field-study projects could include classroom observations and field interviews using ethnographic methods.</p></description>

    <title>Making a Living and a Life: Sustainable Creative Practice</title>
    <minimum_credits>16</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>16</maximum_credits>
    <description><p><em>&quot;The people I love the best</em><br/><em>jump into work head first …&quot;</em></p><p>— Marge Piercy, &quot;To Be of Use&quot;</p><p>This program is for students who want to make a sustainable living through a creative practice, products, or services. This includes students in the arts, entertainment, communications, business, social change, food production, and other fields. Our aim is to help you become a social entrepreneur equipped for a career in either for-profit or nonprofit organizations.</p><p>We will look closely at the history and theory of work, particularly in the areas of organizational management and change. Workplaces are changing, becoming more diverse, varied, and globalized. Keeping this in mind, we will also look closely at the internal infrastructure of organizations and learn about planning and development, writing business plans, doing organizational and marketing research, analyzing data using statistics, and creating budgets using spreadsheet programs. Small-group projects will bring students together to create commentaries on our texts and themes via visual arts, creative writing, and performance. In-program salons will offer opportunities for artists to share their work-in-progress and for artisans, crafters, food producers, and social entrepreneurs to share their prototypes.</p><p>By examining the professional worlds of practitioners through organizational theory and the humanities, we will discover structures that help foster sustainable lives and livelihoods and basic organizational and entrepreneurship principles applicable in many contexts. We&apos;ll read about successful practices and meet successful practitioners—artists, leaders, makers, and doers. Credit will be awarded in the arts (professional practices and public speaking), humanities (studies of organizations via literature and related critical reading and writing skills), social sciences (management, entrepreneurship), and applied math (spreadsheets, detailed budgets, marketing and business plans, fundamentals of statistics and demographics).</p><p>In the fall, we&apos;ll focus on building a common vocabulary concerning professional practices in the arts and organizations and building web and spreadsheet skills. In the winter, students will create sustainable life and business plans, including budgets and marketing plans. In the spring, students will pursue in-program internships or individual projects, along with common work. Weeklong field trips to New York in the fall and Los Angeles in the winter, to meet alumni who are professional practitioners, are an option. During both quarters, we&apos;ll host or, on local and regional field trips, visit artists, makers, and producers. By the end of this program, we hope you will agree with the poet Marge Piercy that:</p><p><em>&quot;… the thing worth doing well done</em><br/><em>has a shape that satisfies, clean and evident.</em><br/><em>Greek amphoras for wine or oil,</em><br/><em>Hopi vases that held corn, are put in museums</em><br/><em>but you know they were made to be used.</em><br/><em>The pitcher cries for water to carry</em><br/><em>and a person for work that is real.&quot;</em></p></description>

    <title>Student-Originated Studies: Literary Arts Capstone</title>
    <minimum_credits>16</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>16</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>This upper-division literary arts workshop provides students with a forum for extended practice in creative writing, literary criticism, book arts, or hybrid works, and it offers the possibility for the development or completion of capstone projects. It is intended for students who have significant college-level experience in writing literary texts, and who are committed to prose forms and narrative arts (fiction, nonfiction) and book arts related to a literary project (or in a literary vein).</p><p>This program will be a lively forum for discussing literary practices; it will help students develop direction as writers and provide support and deadlines for a major project. Program work entails extensive readings from peer and published work, in-class writing exercises, and discussions of works in progress. Documentary, multimedia, hybrid, and post-genre writing projects are welcome. We will look at a number of works by other writers working in and from a range of genres, registers, lineages, and attitudes, which will be useful for your own work. Regular program requirements include but are not limited to: writing daily, bringing original writing to workshop, reading and critiquing the work of other participants, rigorous and serious revision, attendance at all required lectures, giving a talk on a chosen author, writing critical essays, attendance at all required public readings, and meeting with faculty individually to talk about your work. Your final narrative evaluation will be based on your manuscript and your class participation. During spring quarter, students will engage in a two- to four-day residency off campus for intensive writing and workshop in community.</p></description>

    <title>Undergraduate Projects in Critical and Creative Practices</title>
    <minimum_credits>0</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>0</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>This is an opportunity for students to work on faculty-driven scholarly and creative projects. By working with faculty in a studio and research “apprentice” model, students will gain hands-on experience in visual arts studio practices; film/media production practices; the creative writing workshop focused on craft, critical research, and writing; library and archival research practices; and much more.</p><p><strong>Kathleen Eamon</strong>
      (social and political philosophy, aesthetics, philosophy of art) has interests in German idealism (Kant and Hegel), historical materialism (Marx, 20th-century Marxists, and critical theory), and psychoanalysis (Freud and Lacan). She is currently working on an unorthodox project about Kant and Freud, under the working title, “States of Partial Undress: The Fantasy of Sociability.” Students working with Kathleen will have opportunities to join her in her inquiry, learn about and pursue research in the humanities, and critically respond to the project as it comes together. In addition to work in Kantian aesthetics and Freudian dream theory, the project will involve questions about futurity, individual wishes and fantasies, and the possibility of collective and progressive models of sociability and fantasy.
    </p><p><strong>Naima Lowe</strong>
      (experimental media and performance art) creates films, videos, performances, and written works that explore issues of race, gender, and embodiment. The majority of her work includes an archival research element that explores historical social relationships and mythic identities. She is currently working on a series of short films and performances that explore racial identity in rural settings. Students working with Naima will have opportunities to learn media production and postproduction skills (including storyboarding, scripting, 16 mm and HD video shooting, location scouting, audio recording, audio/video editing, etc.) through working with a small crew comprised of students and professional artists. Students would also have opportunities to do archival and historical research on African Americans living in rural settings, and on literature, film, and visual art that deals with similar themes. Students are generally best equipped for this option if they have taken at least one full year of studies in media or visual arts in a program such as Mediaworks, Nonfiction Media, or an equivalent.
    </p><p><strong>Shaw Osha</strong>
      (visual art) works in painting, photography, drawing, writing, and video. She explores issues of visual representation, affect as a desire, social relationship, and the conditions that surround us. She is currently working on a project based on questions of soul in artwork. Students working with Shaw will have opportunities to learn about artistic research, critique, grant and statement writing, website design, studio work, and concerns in contemporary art-making.
    </p><p><strong>Joli Sandoz</strong>
      (creative nonfiction) directs scholarly research focused on critique and/or the writing of creative nonfiction, or critique and/or design of analog games. This opportunity is open to people nearing the end of their Evergreen education who may wish to pursue a major research project, senior thesis, or capstone project in their particular relevant interest. Projects of this type bring together theory and application in the critical and creative pursuit of knowledge new to the researcher. Outstanding creative and critical projects add value to graduate school and job applications, and can enhance skills in synthesis, analysis, and creative thinking and practice. Sandoz specializes in personal and lyric essays, and in board and card games; she does not sponsor projects centered on autobiography, memoir, or computer games (interesting as those topics are).

    <title>Undergraduate Research in the Humanities</title>
    <minimum_credits>0</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>0</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>Students of the humanities who are nearing the end of their Evergreen education may wish to pursue a major research project, senior thesis, or capstone project in their particular field of interest. Often, the goal is to construct an original argument around a particular body of literature, set of ideas, or historical events. These kinds of projects develop advanced research skills in the humanities, including the ability to read deeply and critically in a particular field, and to discover and engage with important theoretical writings in that field. Students will also gain valuable skills in reading, analyzing, synthesizing, writing, and editing long pieces of complex prose. The best kinds of this work will be invaluable for graduate school applications and will be an asset to those entering the job market directly following graduation.</p><p><strong>Stacey Davis</strong> (European history) specializes in French history from the 18th century to the present, as well as the history of French colonies in North and West Africa. Students who wish to study European social, cultural, political, intellectual, or religious history from the Middle Ages to the present, including topics in the history of gender and sociocultural aspects of the history of art, are welcome to propose research projects. Students are welcome to work with Dr. Davis on her ongoing research projects on 19th-century political prisoners, notions of citizenship and democracy in modern Europe, memory, and the history of aging. </p><p><strong>Nancy Koppelman</strong> (American studies) specializes in American social, literary, and intellectual history until 1920. Students who wish to study in these fields are welcome to propose research projects and senior theses. Particular interests include the social and intellectual history of the Puritans; the founding generation, immigrants, the working class, and the middle class; industrialization and reform movements; pragmatic philosophy; the history of childhood; and the history of technology and consumer culture. Students are also welcome to work with Nancy on her ongoing research projects on the histories of social/economic mobility and of individual physical movement.</p></description>

    <title>Undergraduate Research in Scientific Inquiry</title>
    <minimum_credits>0</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>0</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>Rigorous quantitative and qualitative research is an important component of academic learning in scientific inquiry. Research opportunities allow science students to work on specific projects associated with faculty members’ expertise. Students typically begin by working in an apprenticeship model with faculty or laboratory staff and gradually take on more independent projects within the context of the specific research program as they gain experience. Students can develop vital skills in research design, data acquisition and interpretation, modeling and theoretical analysis, written and oral communication, collaboration, and critical thinking. These are valuable skills for students pursuing a graduate degree or entering the job market.</p><p>Faculty offering undergraduate research opportunities are listed below. Contact them directly if you are interested.</p><p><strong>Abir Biswas</strong> (geology, earth science) studies nutrient and toxic trace-metal cycles in terrestrial and coastal ecosystems. Potential projects could include studies of mineral weathering, wildfires, and mercury cycling in ecosystems. Students could pursue these interests at the laboratory scale or through field-scale biogeochemistry studies, taking advantage of the Evergreen Ecological Observation Network, a long-term ecological study area. Students with backgrounds in a combination of geology, biology, or chemistry can gain skills in soil, vegetation, and water collection and learn methods of sample preparation and analysis for major and trace elements.</p><p><strong>Andrew Brabban</strong> (biotechnology) studies the physiology and biochemistry of prokaryotes of industrial and agricultural importance. Students who commit at least a full year to a research project, enrolling for 4 to 16 credits each quarter, will learn a broad range of microbiology (both aerobic and anaerobic techniques), molecular (DNA analysis and cloning), and biochemical techniques (chemical and pathway analysis, protein isolation). Students will also have opportunities for internships at the USDA and elsewhere, and to present data at national and international conferences.</p><p><strong>Dharshi Bopegedera</strong> (chemistry) would like to engage students in three projects: (1) There is concern that toxic metals are found in unsafe quantities in children’s toys and cosmetics. She would like to engage a student in the quantitative determination of these metals, using the AA and the ICP-MS. Students who are interested in learning to use these instruments and quantitative analysis techniques will find this project interesting. (2) Science and education. With Dharshi, students will work with local teachers to develop lab activities that enhance the science curriculum in local schools. Students with an interest in teaching science who have completed general chemistry with laboratory would be ideal for this project. (3) Dharshi is also interested in looking at chemicals present in e-cigarettes. A student interested in this project could work on the organic or inorganic chemicals.</p><p><strong>Clarissa Dirks</strong> (biology) conducts research in many areas of microbiology and ecology. Her recent work in microbiology has focused on the biodiversity and distribution of tardigrades in different ecosystems. She also aims to better understand the evolutionary principles that underlie the emergence, spread, and containment of infectious disease by studying the co-evolution of retroviruses and their hosts. Lastly, she is conducting snail surveys to better characterize the species in Washington state, something that hasn’t been done in many decades. Depending on the project, students will gain experience in molecular biology techniques, microbiology, field ecology, genetics, bioinformatics, and tissue culture.</p><p><strong>Lydia</strong><strong>McKinstry</strong> (organic chemistry) is interested in organic synthesis research, including asymmetric synthesis methodology, chemical reaction dynamics, and small molecule synthesis. One specific study involves the design and synthesis of enzyme inhibitor molecules to be used as effective laboratory tools with which to study the mechanistic steps of programmed cell death (e.g., in cancer cells). Students with a background in organic chemistry and biology will gain experience with the laboratory techniques of organic synthesis, as well as the techniques of spectroscopy.</p><p><strong>Donald Morisato</strong> (biology) is interested in the developmental biology of the <em>Drosophila</em> embryo, a model system for analyzing how patterning occurs. Maternally encoded signaling pathways establish the anterior-posterior and dorsal-ventral axes. Individual student projects will use a combination of genetic, molecular biological, and biochemical approaches to investigate the spatial regulation of this complex process.</p><p><strong>Jim Neitzel</strong> (biochemistry) uses methods from organic and analytical chemistry to study biologically interesting molecules. A major focus of his current work is on fatty acids; in particular, finding spectroscopic and chromatographic methods to identify fatty acids in complex mixtures and to detect changes that occur in fats during processing or storage. This has relevance both for foods and in biodiesel production. The other major area of interest is in plant natural products, such as salicylates. Work is in process screening local plants for the presence of these molecules, which are important plant-defense signals. Work is also supported in determining the nutritional value of indigenous plants. Students with a background and interest in organic or analytical biochemistry will contribute to this work.</p><p><strong>Neal Nelson</strong> (computer science) is interested in working with advanced computer topics and current problems in the application of computing to the sciences. His areas of interest include simulations of advanced architectures for distributed computing, advanced programming languages and compilers, and programming languages for concurrent and parallel computing.</p><p><strong>Mike Paros</strong> (physiology, microbiology, veterinary medicine) is interested in animal health, diseases that affect the animal agriculture industry, and basic ecology of bacteriophage in physiologic systems. Currently funded research includes the development of bacteriophage therapy for dairy cattle mastitis. A number of hands-on laboratory projects are available to students interested in pursuing careers in science, with a particular emphasis on microbiology.</p><p><strong>Paula Schofield</strong> (organic, polymer, materials chemistry) is interested in the interdisciplinary fields of biodegradable plastics and biomedical polymers. Research in the field of biodegradable plastics is becoming increasingly important to replace current petroleum-derived materials and to reduce the environmental impact of plastic wastes. Modification of starch through copolymerization and use of bacterial polyesters show promise in this endeavor. Specific projects within biomedical polymers involve the synthesis of poly (lactic acid) copolymers that have potential for use in tissue engineering. Students with a background in chemistry and biology will gain experience in the synthesis and characterization of these novel polymer materials. Students will present their work at American Chemical Society conferences.</p><p><strong>Sheryl Shulman</strong> (computer science) is interested in working with advanced computer topics and current problems in the application of computing to the sciences. Her areas of interest include advanced programming languages and compilers, programming language design, programming languages for concurrent and parallel computing, and logic programming.</p><p><strong>Rebecca Sunderman</strong> (inorganic/materials chemistry, physical chemistry) is interested in the synthesis and property characterization of new bismuth-containing materials. These compounds have been characterized as electronic conductors, attractive activators for luminescent materials, second harmonic generators, and oxidation catalysts for several organic compounds. Traditional solid-state synthesis methods will be utilized to prepare new complex bismuth oxides. Once synthesized, powder X-ray diffraction patterns will be obtained and material properties such as conductivity, melting point, biocidal tendency, coherent light production, and magnetic behavior will be examined when appropriate.</p><p><strong>Brian Walter</strong> (mathematics) is interested in problems relating to graphs, combinatorial games, and especially, combinatorial games played on graphs. He would like to work with students who have a strong background in mathematics and/or computer science and are interested in applying their skills to open-ended problems relating to graphs and/or games.</p><p><strong>Richard Weiss</strong> (computer science, mathematics) has several ongoing projects in computer vision, robotics, and security. There are some opportunities for students to develop cybersecurity games for teaching network-security concepts and skills. In robotics, he is looking for students to develop laboratory exercises for several different mobile robotic platforms, including Scribbler, LEGO NXT, and iRobot Create. This would also involve writing tools for image processing and computer vision using sequences of still images, video streams, and 2.5-D images from the Kinect. In addition, he is open to working with students who have their own ideas for projects in these and related areas, such as machine learning, artificial intelligence, and analysis of processor performance.</p><p><strong>Pauline Yu</strong> (marine science) studies the developmental physiology and ecology of marine invertebrates. She is interested in the biochemistry of the seawater-organism interface, developmental nutritional biochemistry and metabolic depression, invasive species, carbonate chemistry (ocean acidification), and cultural relationships with foods from the sea. Students have the opportunity to collaboratively develop lines of inquiry for lab and/or field studies in ecology, developmental biology, physiology, marine carbonate chemistry, and mariculture.</p><p class="Body1"><strong>EJ Zita</strong> (physics), who has expertise in energy physics, modeling, and organic farming, is researching sustainability and climate change. Many students have done fine projects on sustainable energy and food production in her academic programs. Zita is working with Judy Cushing and Scott Morgan to establish a new research program at Evergreen. She and Cushing will model land use impacts on climate change; she and Morgan will plan and facilitate sustainability projects on campus.</p></description>

    <description><p>This program brings together those drawn to the challenges and satisfactions of designing and making in multiple dimensions and various scales —artists, craftspeople, designers, and builders. Can you make places and things that are expressive and compelling, purposeful and beautiful, using ways that are responsive to and respectful of natural cycles and living communities? How do you justify your choices and measure your success? How do the things you make fit into sustaining and sustainable ways of living, for you and others?</p><p>An integrative studio will be the pivotal activity of the program, and we’ll emphasize skill development in drawing as a key means of expression, idea development, and communication. There will be intensive work in drawing, design, making, and presentation, along with supporting reading, research, and writing in basic ecology and materials sciences, environmental art and design, craft and construction, and sustainability and justice studies. There will be field trips, seminars, and critiques as well. We will challenge the conventional distinctions between art, craft, and design, and look for commonalities of approach and meaning. Fall quarter work will address drawing, design process, materials studies, and larger cultural and environmental contexts of making. Studio projects will focus on joining—how materials are put together to functional and expressive ends. Winter quarter work will continue to build on drawing, design, and making skills, and address site contexts and place making. Studio projects will focus on expressive and functional challenges in context with their surroundings. In the spring quarter, students will have the opportunity to engage in individual and small group sculpture, craft, or small construction projects at a variety of scales, grounded in real-world site and community contexts, carefully researched and realized.</p><p>Goals include an understanding of the dimensions of sustainability in contemporary art and design, advanced drawing, conceptualizing and fabrication skills, informed use of materials, knowledge of environmental art and design history and ideas, skillful responses to sites and communities, a reasoned and rigorous approach to personal work, and a better sense of how to live and work sustainably as an artist, craftsperson, or designer. Our projects will involve students in real-world contexts as well as the constraints and trade-offs—essential experience for those who wish to make a difference. We’ll aim to have “serious fun” in the studio, and to make works that are expressive arguments for positive awareness and change.</p></description>

    <description><p>This program, co-taught by a ceramic artist and a river scientist, gives students the opportunity to explore the similarities between artistic and scientific processes of inquiry while learning about the practical applications of ceramic art and stream ecology. We will explore the complicated relationships between rivers and clay, and how each can help to create and shape the other. We will learn about how rivers work, how to measure them to better understand them, and about the diverse organisms that call rivers home. We will learn about the physical and chemical structure of clay, glazes, and their mineral elements. In both quarters, students will discuss assigned readings in seminars. They will engage in active writing exercises and rigorous two-dimensional and three-dimensional visual art work in ceramics, mixed-media sculpture, and drawing. Students will also research experiences in stream ecology.</p><p>In the winter quarter, students will gain experience in the studio and the laboratory, learning the fundamentals of working with clay and the fundamentals of working with microscopes and other lab and field equipment. Students will take several day trips and one overnight trip to local environments to examine and collect sources of clay and to implement a variety of field methods in stream ecology.</p><p>In the spring quarter, we will continue to master concepts in ceramics and ecology. Our program will culminate in a multiday field trip to the desert Southwest to learn about traditional Japanese and Native American clay techniques—and to learn about the unique challenges faced by desert rivers. Students will formulate research questions that will be addressed using group research projects in both stream ecology and ceramics.</p></description>

    <description><p>This is a one-quarter program designed to support students learning introductory plant biology in an interdisciplinary format. Students will learn about plant anatomy, morphology, evolution, and systematics. Lectures based on textbook readings supplement the laboratory work. The learning community will explore how present form and function informs us about the evolution of major groups of plants such as mosses, ferns, conifers, and flowering plants. Students will get hands-on experience studying plants under microscopes and in the field. Students will also learn how to maintain a detailed and illustrated nature journal to develop basic identification skills of local native species of plants. They will be taught basic botanical illustration skills to support this work. This program also focuses on people&apos;s relationships with plants for food, fiber, medicine, and aesthetics. Students will study economic botany through seminar texts, films, and lectures that examine agriculture, forestry, herbology, and horticulture. They will examine political-economic factors that shape our relations with plants. The learning community will use economic and historical lenses to inquire about why people have favored some plants and not others—or why those preferences have radically changed. (For example, why might a former cash crop be considered a weed?) In our readings, we will examine the significant roles botany has played in colonialism, imperialism, and globalization. Initiatives to foster more socially just and environmentally sustainable relations with plants will be investigated. Weekly workshops will help students improve their ability to write thesis-driven essays defended with evidence from assigned texts. Quizzes, exams, and weekly assignments will help students and faculty assess learning.</p></description>

    <description><p>This upper-division program will develop and interrelate concepts in experimental (laboratory) biology, organic chemistry, and biochemistry, thus providing a foundation for students who plan to continue studies in laboratory science and medicine. In a yearlong sequence, students will carry out upper-division work in biochemistry, genetics, cellular and molecular biology, neurobiology, and organic chemistry.</p><p>The program will examine the subject matter through the central idea of structure-property relationships and integrate two themes: one at the &quot;molecular&quot; level and the other at the &quot;cell&quot; level. In the “molecule” theme, we will examine organic chemistry and the nature of organic compounds and reactions, then carry this theme into biochemistry and the fundamental chemical reactions of living systems, considering structure-function relationships on many scales. In the “cell” theme, we will look at structure-function relationships at the level of the cell and proceed to the whole organism. The two themes will continually merge through studies of cellular and molecular processes in biological systems throughout the year.</p><p>This is an intensive program; the subjects are complex, and the sophisticated understanding we expect to develop will require devoted attention and many hours of work each week, both in and out of class. Each aspect of the program will contain a significant laboratory component. Each week, students will write papers and maintain laboratory notebooks. All laboratory work and approximately one half of the non-lecture time will take place in collaborative problem-solving groups. Group work will also include reading and discussion of topics of current or historical significance in science. Students who complete work at the appropriate level, and who fulfill the requirements and college-level achievement standards of the program as determined by the faculty, will be awarded full upper-division credit. Faculty will establish criteria for upper-division credit in each subject area.</p><p> </p></description>

    <minimum_credits>16</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>16</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>This Student-Originated Studies (SOS) program is an opportunity for students to do intermediate or advanced work in disability studies, an interdisciplinary academic field that includes an exploration of (1) the historical, cultural, artistic, and other dimensions of disability, (2) social justice issues and political activism in the disability community, and (3) the intersections among disability, race, gender, class, sex, and other markers of identity. Students will link theory and practice through engagement with in-depth academic research and writing, as well as participation in community-based activities involving adults with disabilities. Although the bulk of SOS work will be conducted independently, all students will be required to participate in some group activities.</p><p>Students will meet weekly, as a group, to discuss readings, provide project progress reports and, perhaps most importantly, to build community and support each other&apos;s work. In addition, students will participate, as a group, in several brown-bag luncheon meetings, or other activities, sponsored by the University of Washington Disability Studies program and attended by UW students, staff, and faculty. Details on the content of these two sets of group activities will be provided during the first weekly class meeting.</p><p>A combination of academic and internship credit will be awarded in this SOS. Academic credit will include four credits for seminar participation, four for the writing and presentation of final projects, and four for a journal of reflections on students&apos; overall internship experiences. Four internship credits will be awarded for participation as a tutor in the LEAD (Literacy and Education for Adults with Disabilities) program, a collaboration between Evergreen and Olympia-based Kokua Services, a non-profit, residential-support agency that serves adults with disabilities.</p></description>

    <title>The Prison-Industrial Complex: Explorations in Social Psychology and Writing</title>
    <minimum_credits>8</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>8</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>What led to the massive rise in incarceration in America over the past 40 years? What are some solutions in prevention, strategies to strengthen resilience while incarcerated, and ways to integrate formerly incarcerated populations back into their communities? Demonizing individuals and groups is a classic strategy used in psychology and perpetuated by mass media to motivate one population to discriminate against, hate, commit violence toward, and even annihilate an “out group.” With nearly four decades of failure to fund mental health care and substance abuse treatment, America’s jails and prisons have become the default solution to many social ills. Despite evidence that punishment of this kind does not work, incarceration in all its forms is garnering a greater portion of resources than ever.</p><p>Many of our ideas and opinions about mass incarceration have been shaped by mass media. Meanwhile, the most popular genre of writing by incarcerated men and women is poetry, both literary and spoken word. In this writing-intensive eight-credit, two-quarter program, we will examine media coverage of criminal justice and the prison system; explore poetry, fiction, and nonfiction writing of residents of correctional facilities; and practice fundamentals of journalism and poetry. We will also examine fundamental psychological research underlying social cognition, stereotypes, prejudice, attitude formation and change, and self-deception and self-justification. We&apos;ll look at the roles and practices of politics, the justice system, and media in “belief transmission” to uncover the foundations of social stratification, covert and overt classism and racism, mandatory minimum sentencing, the privatization of prisons, the uses of solitary confinement, and the new threat of hyper-militarized police practices, weapons, and tactics. Additionally, we will identify evidence-based practices that look to resolve these issues using a different lens (early education, adequate mental health care and drug treatment, restorative justice, community-based journalism and poetry, positive psychology, etc.). We will call on leaders and participants from many arenas to help us examine the critical questions and potential answers in addressing this growing identification of the U.S. as a “prison nation.”</p><p>This program is relevant for careers in psychology, media and journalism, government, criminal justice, law enforcement, social services, education, law, and the arts. Credit will be awarded in psychology, journalism, and poetry.</p></description>

    <title>Geology and Ecology of Land-Ocean Margins</title>
    <minimum_credits>16</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>16</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>Land-ocean margins such as coasts and estuaries are dynamic systems affected by both continental and marine processes. These boundary systems between land and sea contain unique habitats characterized by high biodiversity and elevated biological productivity. </p><p>This program examines the geologic processes that generate coastal land forms and the physical forces that shape these features (e.g. tides, waves, and currents). In addition, we will study how organisms have adapted to the stresses associated with intertidal and estuarine environments and the factors that explain their elevated productivity. Current issues associated with the management of coastal resources, shoreline erosion, and geologic hazard preparation will be discussed. Labs will introduce methods in geology and ecology. Workshops will develop quantitative reasoning skills and introduce GIS software. Through field trips, the program will explore a variety of coastal and estuarine environments along the Pacific coast of Washington and on Puget Sound. This program provides a model of interdisciplinary approaches that are needed for successful work in environmental studies.</p></description>

    <title>Barely Modern: Aesthetics and Philosophies of Disillusionment</title>
    <minimum_credits>16</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>16</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>Our program will explore a set of surprising ideas and identities that emerged in reaction to the perceived clutter, alienation, and violence of early 20th century modernity. Europe and the U.S. will serve as the focus of much of our inquiry; we will also consider modernity’s detractors in Asia, especially those invested in new anti-colonial nationalisms. We will take particular interest in aesthetic, social, and epistemological movements aimed at stripping down and baring all: so-called “primitivism” and minimalism; naturism and socialism; and the emerging disciplines of psychoanalysis, sociology, and cultural anthropology. How did these movements articulate their disillusionment? What kinds of imaginaries—of the past, of nature, of community, of decadence, of the unconscious, of the “savage”—shaped everyday practices, critical philosophies, and utopian visions? We will look at both what seem to be “naive” responses (e.g., nudism as health and hobby) and their “knowing” re-inscription as artistic and theoretical strategies (e.g., minimalism and decadence). Although our gaze will be directed to the past, we will find there uncanny echoes of our own contemporary social and political worlds. </p><p>We will approach our studies through a range of materials, looking at modernist and anti-modernist texts, art, and design, as well as more contemporary critical theory, cultural studies, anthropology, and history. Possible areas of focus include the sociology of Georg Simmel, Freud’s psychoanalytic theories, Picasso’s primitivism, Gandhi’s philosophies, Le Corbusier’s architecture, Franz Boas’ anthropology, the photography of Edward Curtis, and the performances of Josephine Baker. Students will conduct close readings and regular written work. Each student will also choose, develop, and pursue a substantial primary source–based research project.</p></description>

    <title>Marine Life: Marine Organisms and Their Environments</title>
    <minimum_credits>16</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>16</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>This program focuses on marine organisms, the sea as a habitat, the relationships between the organisms, the physical/chemical properties of their environments, and their adaptations to those environments. Students will study the biology and ecology of marine organisms, as well as physical and chemical oceanographic concepts as they apply to those organisms. The program will offer students the opportunity to refine their field-sampling skills and associated statistics and laboratory techniques. Throughout the program, students will focus on the identification of marine organisms, study key aspects of the ecology of selected species and marine habitats, and develop their understanding of contemporary impacts on the marine habitat. Physiological adaptations to diverse marine environments and the evolutionary history of life from the sea will be also be emphasized.</p><p>We will study physical features of marine waters, nutrients, biological productivity, and regional topics in marine science. Concepts will be applied in faculty-designed experiments and student-designed research projects both in the lab and in the field. Data analysis will be facilitated through the use of spreadsheets, analytical software, and elementary statistics. Seminars will analyze appropriate primary literature on topics from lectures and research projects.</p><p>Winter quarter will emphasize laboratory techniques and fundamental principles. Spring quarter will emphasize the application of techniques and principles to research projects, as well as guide students in the appropriate collection, analysis, and reporting of their own project results. The faculty will facilitate identification of student research projects, which may range from studies of water quality to ecological investigations of local estuarine animals. Students will design their research projects during winter quarter and write research proposals that will undergo class-wide peer review. The research projects will then be carried out during spring quarter and, at the end of spring quarter, students will document their work in written research papers and oral presentations.</p></description>

    <title>Field Ecology</title>
    <minimum_credits>16</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>16</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>This program will focus on intensive group and individual field research on current topics in ecological science. These topics will include forest structure, ecosystem ecology, effects of forest management, ecological restoration, riparian ecology, fire history, bird abundance and monitoring, insect-plant interactions, and disturbance ecology. Students will be expected to intensively use the primary literature and student-driven field research to address observations about ecological composition, structure, and function. Multiple independent and group research projects will form the core of our work in local forests of the south Puget Sound lowlands, national forests, national parks, state forests, and other relevant natural settings. Students are expected to hit the ground running and should develop research projects for the entire quarter within the first several weeks of the program.</p><p>Through a series of short, intensive field exercises, students will hone their skills in observation, developing testable hypotheses, and designing ways to test those hypotheses. We will also explore field techniques and approaches in ecology, and especially approaches related to measuring plant and avian biodiversity. Students will have the option to participate in field trips to remote sites in the Pacific Northwest. Research projects will be formally presented by groups and individuals at the end of the quarter. Finally, student research manuscripts will be created throughout the quarter, utilizing a series of intensive multi-day paper-writing workshops. We will emphasize identification of original field research problems in forest habitats, experimentation, data analyses, oral presentation of findings, and writing in scientific journal format.</p></description>

    <title>Intermediate Macroeconomics</title>
    <minimum_credits>16</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>16</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>This program is designed for students who are interested in critically studying economics beyond the introductory level. In lecture and workshop, we will complete the equivalent of textbook intermediate macroeconomics, which focuses primarily on the determinants of economic growth, employment rates, inflation, and income distribution. We will assess the &quot;appropriate&quot; roles for the federal government in the economy (e.g., determining the right fiscal and monetary policy mix, setting exchange rates, and eliminating or creating trade barriers). While there is no specific math prerequisite, extending our math skills will be an objective of the program. </p><p>In the process, we will critically assess the limits of macroeconomic theory. For example, does the theory adequately consider income distribution effects of policy options? Do macroeconomic prescriptions contribute to gender inequalities? To what extent do ideological predispositions intersect with the science of economics, influencing prescriptions about the size of the money supply or the judged appropriateness of tax cuts?</p><p>In seminar, we will survey areas of applied macroeconomics and gain familiarity with the various schools of thought (i.e., Keynesian, post-Keynesian, monetarist, Austrian, and Marxian approaches).</p><p>Program activities will include lectures, workshops, exams, short research papers, and seminars.</p></description>

    <title>Mediaworks: Signifying Power and Difference on Screen(s)</title>
    <minimum_credits>16</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>16</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>What does it mean to make moving images in an age of omnipresent media, information overload, social inequality, and global capitalism? What&apos;s the relationship between aesthetic form and power across race, class, gender, and other axes of difference? How can we understand the interplay between popular media and experimental modes? How do we critically engage with the history and traditions of media practices while testing the boundaries of established forms? What responsibilities do media artists and producers have to their subjects and audiences? Can media artists contribute to social change? As media artists, how do we enter debates around social and political justice? How do we critically engage new media as a form of activism and cultural critique? Students will engage with these questions as they gain skills in film/video/television history and theory, critical analysis, media production, collaboration, and critique.</p><p>This full-time, yearlong program links media theory with practice. We will explore a variety of media modes and communication strategies, primarily interrogating representations of the &quot;real” in media texts spanning the continuum between popular entertainment and artistic practice. As creative critics, we will gain fluency in methodologies including close reading and formal analysis; mapping narrative and genre; unpacking power from feminist, critical race, decolonial, and anti-capitalist perspectives; and cultural, historical, and technological framing of commercial and independent media production. These analytical skills will help us understand strategies that artists have employed to challenge, mobilize, and reappropriate mainstream media forms. As critical creators, we&apos;ll learn foundational production skills and experiment with alternative approaches, including nonfiction, video art, writing for and about media, autobiography, essay films, remix, installations, and performance. In addition to production assignments, program activities will encompass analysis and criticism through screenings, readings, seminars, research, and critical writing. We&apos;ll also spend significant time in critique sessions discussing our creative and critical work.</p><p>In fall, students will explore ways of seeing, listening, and observing in various formats, focusing intensively on 16mm film production and completing both skill-building exercises and short projects. These collaborative exercises and projects will have thematic and technical guidelines consistent with the program curriculum. Our production work will be grounded in the study of concepts and methodologies from media history and theory, including significant critical reading, research, and writing. In hands-on workshops and assignments, we&apos;ll analyze images as communication and commodities and investigate how images create and contest meaning in art, politics, and consumer culture.</p><p>In winter, students will delve deeply into field- and studio-based video/audio production and digital editing, using the CCAM studio and HD video technologies. We&apos;ll do this learning in conjunction with studying the social and technological history of television and video. Our production work will be primarily collaborative, though students will conclude the quarter by working on an independent project proposal.</p><p>In spring, as a culmination of the conceptual, collaboration, and production skills developed in fall and winter, each student will create an independent project. Possible forms include video or film, installation, web-based projects, research projects, and internships. Technical workshops, screenings, research presentations, and critique discussions will support this emerging work.</p></description>

    <title>The Funding of Higher Education: Debt, the Great Divide!</title>
    <minimum_credits>16</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>16</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>How is college funded, and on whose dime? How much should a state or nation pay for the education of its citizens beyond secondary school, and how much should the expense of higher education fall upon individuals and their families?</p><p>In this program, students will explore the financing of higher education as a case study, or lens, through which they look at larger economic and social issues—and around which they build applicable skills in finance, economics, business, writing, communication, and research. What is the history of funding for higher education? How do various economic, social, and cultural models impact funding and society? What is the role of economics and finance? What about fundraising, grants, and scholarships? What are the related issues of social justice, equity, access, and political advocacy? How do individuals, families, and communities—in diverse cultures and societies—build systems of altruism, gift-giving, and exchange, and why is this important to consider today? What role does personal finance play? What are alternative models for the funding of higher education?</p><p>The program will include lectures, seminars, workshops, films, and guest speakers. Students will participate in collaborative projects and research, and learn from a variety of community leaders.</p></description>

    <title>African/American: Afrofuturism</title>
    <minimum_credits>16</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>16</maximum_credits>
    <description><p><em>&quot;Space is the place.&quot; — </em>Sun Ra</p><p>Afrofuturism is a literary and cultural aesthetic embraced by artists who have imagined alternative futures while often grappling with aspects of race, ethnicity, gender, (dis)ability, and class. Rone Shavers and Charles Joseph offered a critical working definition of the genre, first named by Mark Dery in 1993: &quot;Afro-Futurism … combines elements of science fiction, historical fiction, fantasy, and magic realism with non-Occidental (non-Western) cosmologies in order to critique not only the present-day dilemmas of people of color, but also to revise, interrogate, and re-examine the historical events of the past.&quot; Artists often listed in an Afrofuturist pantheon include authors Samuel R. Delany and Octavia Butler; visual artists Jean-Michel Basquiat and Renée Cox; and musicians George Clinton, Bootsy Collins, Sun Ra, DJ Spooky, and Janelle Monáe.</p><p>After laying the groundwork for explorations of these and other artists, we will ask students to help us address additional avenues for explorations of Afrofuturism, including race and digital culture; utopia, dystopia, and the &quot;post-historical;&quot; prostheses and the body; urban musics (drum and bass, garage, hip-hop, house, jungle, neo-soul, funk, dub, techno, trip-hop, etc.); interrogations of identity and identity politics; previous race-based art movements (e.g., the Harlem Renaissance, Black Arts Movement); Black liberation songs; superheroes, rebels, and comic books as contemporary folklore; film/video studies; and social and cultural implications.</p><p>Because the artworks we will encounter will be both exciting and provocative, we think that students will find this hard intellectual work deeply rewarding, sometimes in unexpected ways. We expect to learn from students and to share an intellectual adventure in an ever-evolving, engrossing artistic terrain. While research writing and criticism will be emphasized, students will also be encouraged to pursue optional creative writing and music projects for possible presentation to the entire program.</p></description>

    <description><p><i>“To speak a true word is to transform the world … [the] word is not the privilege of some few persons but the right of everyone.”</i> — Paulo Freire, <em>Pedagogy of the Oppressed</em></p><p>This program is offered in collaboration with Evergreen’s Center for Community-Based Learning and Action. It supports students to work in community settings through internships or projects. It builds skills for community work and provides a collaborative learning space through round-table discussions.</p><p>Our primary focus is on literacy. For many organizations, literacy is central to the development of personal and collective capacity; it is a foundation for full community participation, and it figures in the development of social movements. Literacy highlights the many domains of knowledge people possess, even if their knowledge is not validated through formal schooling. It encompasses not just language and reading, but the ability to intervene in issues important to community life, including youth development, homelessness, public health, immigration, environmental justice, and climate change. Finally, literacy means the collective production of knowledge through dialogue, research, writing, and cultural and artistic production.</p><p>We will learn about literacy in a community context, while expanding our own literacy skills. In fall, students will learn video production and explore how art and culture can document and intervene in community struggles. Workshops include documentary video production, working respectfully with community organizations, and oral histories. Practices of reflective and autobiographical writing will be taught and strongly encouraged. Students will earn half their credits through a project or internship (15–20 hours per week), and half in the classroom through critical exploration of case studies and discussion of community experiences. The goal is to build a foundation for extensive community work in winter and spring. Possible readings include Horton’s <em>The Long Haul</em>, Freire&apos;s <em>Pedagogy of the Oppressed</em>, Barndt’s <em>Wild Fire: Art as Activism</em>, and Landay and Wootton’s <em>A Reason to Read: Linking Literacy and the Arts</em>.  </p><p>In winter and spring, students will earn up to 12 credits through community work (20–30 hours per week) while participating in classroom-based learning and reflection (4 credits). Students will meet as a group one day per week to share successes and challenges, discuss short readings, and participate in workshops. Workshops will include refining skills in community-based work and reflective writing, using writing and art as tools to support literacy, and exploring how our personal histories shape our interactions with communities. Readings will cover case studies in the U.S. and Latin America, including informal publishing projects, alternative library systems, memory work, and photography. At the end of winter quarter, students will collaboratively shape our spring reading list.  </p><p>This program is ideal for responsible, self-motivated students. It is intended for students who value collaborative learning, are enthusiastic about shaping a community of co-learners and co-teachers, and are committed to learning from and with community organizations.</p></description>

    <description><p>This program will investigate the nature of economic, political, social, military, ideological, and interpersonal power. The interrelationship of these dimensions will be a primary area of study. We will explore these themes through lectures, films, seminars, and a journal, and by writing short papers.</p><p>The analysis will be guided by the following questions, as well as others that may emerge from our discussions: What does power mean? Are there different kinds of power, and how are they interrelated? Who has power in American society? Who is relatively powerless? Why? How is power accumulated? What resources are involved? How is power utilized, and with what impact, on various sectors of the population? What characterizes the struggle for power? How does domestic power relate to international power? How is international power used? How are people affected by the current power structure? What responsibilities do citizens have to alter the structure of power? What alternative structures are possible, probable, necessary, or desirable?</p><p>In this period of war and economic, social, and political crisis, a good deal of our study will focus on international relations in a systematic and intellectual manner. There will be a good deal of reading. Please be prepared to work hard and to challenge your own and others’ thinking.</p></description>

    <title>Reproduction: Gender, Race, and Power</title>
    <minimum_credits>16</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>16</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>This program will offer an overview of human reproduction, paying particular attention to gender and race as vectors of power that affect how reproduction is discussed, legislated, and experienced in the United States. We will explore interrelated lines of inquiry using literature, philosophy, sociology, ethics, human biology, and public health texts; in other words, this program will not attempt to construct a systematic history, but will rather use a series of case studies to develop an intersectional analysis of reproduction as a phenomenon that cannot be separated from issues of race and gender.</p><p>The study of reproduction is, by its very nature, interdisciplinary. Students who are successful in this program will gain a foundation in reproductive physiology, basic genetics, and endocrinology, and they will apply their learning to specific issues such as the susceptibility of the reproductive body to societal influences and stress through epigenetics. Our examination of the biology of reproduction will include some lab work in microscopy and dissections, and students will demonstrate their learning through workshops, problem sets, and examinations.</p><p>Biology is also shaped and defined by cultural norms. Accordingly, we will collectively dismantle the idea that women are defined as such by an innate reproductive capacity, and the syllabus will include texts that address the experiences of trans and gender-nonconforming individuals. We will also discuss the ways in which contraception, abortion, forced sterilization, genetic testing, and other forms of reproductive control both reflect, and have been used to perpetuate, systemic racism. In all aspects of the program, students will be expected to engage in thoughtful and occasionally challenging conversations about how power and privilege operate on a variety of bodies, including our own.</p><p>Through both formal and informal assignments, this program will help students learn to listen and observe attentively, do close and critical reading with challenging texts, contribute clear and well-developed writing, make relevant contributions to seminar discussions, and acquire and demonstrate physiologic reasoning skills. In our pursuit of diverse perspectives and approaches, we’ll welcome a variety of health care providers as guest speakers, and will participate in a few field trips to local clinics, hospitals, and birth centers. The reading list will include texts such as Michel Foucault’s <i>The</i> <em>History of Sexuality</em>, Dorothy Roberts’ <em>Fatal Invention</em>, and Rickie Solinger’s <em>Pregnancy and Power.</em> In order to foster critical engagement with these and other texts, students will be asked to complete weekly papers as well as integrative essays and in-class reflective writing assignments. In the second quarter of the program, students will be given the opportunity to design and execute a self-directed independent research project.</p></description>

    <title>Creating Dance: Basic Technique, Theory, and Composition</title>
    <minimum_credits>16</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>16</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>This full-time, one-quarter program is a basic course of study in fine art dance that is suitable for beginners as well as experienced dancers wanting to refine basic dance skills. Fundamentals of modern dance technique, theory, improvisation, composition, and performance will be covered. Original student dance compositions will be systematically developed and performed regularly for peer and faculty critique. We will use the Nikolais/Louis system, a technique based in the principles of anatomy and kinesiology as developed by Rudolf von Laban, Hanya Holm, Alwin Nikolais, and Murray Louis. Throughout the quarter we will learn a basic kinesiological grammar expressed in values of shape, space, time, and motion. The study of experiential anatomy (&quot;somatics&quot;) and kinesiology form the foundation of a basic artistic technique leading to three interrelated program goals: 1) to establish and maintain a safe and healthy dance technique that includes sound protocols for injury prevention and care, 2) to develop clarity of artistic exposition, 3) to place the art of dance in its social, historical, and interdisciplinary context. Completion of the program will prepare students for intermediate study in dance and physical theater.</p></description>

    <description><p>This program investigates the relationship between modern cities and the art that shapes and responds to their historic, geographic, and contemporary socio-cultural identities. Urban living brings with it an immediacy of culture clash, social mixing, and the loss of local identities for new denizens, yet also the potential for the reconstruction and/or reconfiguration of both individual and collective identities. Cities are sites of social, economic, ethnic, and gender hierarchies, yet have also been at the forefront of radicalization and revolution in terms of gender, class, and race.</p><p>New York and Paris will be our focus. Through the intertwined disciplines of art and history, we will take a visual and critical studies approach to how these cities are formed by social, cultural, and political history, including the legacies of aristocracy, revolution, slavery, and waves of immigration. We will consider how the vestiges of the past are present in the architecture, geography, community structures, and social and cultural landscapes of each city. By accounting for their particular American and European histories, we will study contemporary issues and visual landscapes that reveal tensions over resources and the myriad social and political realities in these cities. How did past artistic movements, like impressionism in Paris and the Harlem Renaissance in New York, reflect and challenge the cultural norms and tensions in those cities? What sort of art became codified in museums, salons, and academies, and what art broke boundaries and created its own rules?</p><p>Our inquiries will be shaped by studies of major current sociopolitical and artistic events occurring as the 30 weeks unfold. These may include conflicts over immigration, social movements, political change, violence and fears of terrorist attacks, as well as issues of free speech, discrimination, and social justice. Students will be instructed in theory and practice in arts and humanities methodologies of investigation, including work in history, art history, urban and gender studies, and a visual arts practice. In fall quarter, instruction in drawing and painting will acquaint students with formal issues in visual language so they can represent and visualize ideas. Students will practice modalities of research in the humanities that will prepare them to conduct research and write a research paper later in the year. In winter, students will practice following lines of investigation in art-making and writing through assignments and working in small collaborations. In fall and winter, there will be short field trips to study local cities and their art scenes.</p><p>During the 10-week period spanning the second half of winter and the first half of spring quarters, students will hone their own artistic practice or academic research in response to their growing understanding of the identities and tensions present in New York, Paris, or another city of their choice. Students will have the opportunity for individual travel to study a city in depth for this independent research or artistic project. Students will return to the classroom in the middle of spring quarter to reflect on, critically examine, and integrate their fall quarter theoretical and methodological learning with their winter and spring quarter research or artistic practice.</p></description>

    <title>Washington State Legislative Internships</title>
    <minimum_credits>16</minimum_credits>
    <maximum_credits>16</maximum_credits>
    <description><p>Taking advantage of Evergreen&apos;s proximity to the capital of Washington state, this internship presents the opportunity to observe firsthand the development of public policy in that arena. Drawing from the social sciences and systems and change theory, students explore the evolving systems of law, regulation, and governance. Students will learn about proposed legislation on a variety of issues. They will reflect on the dynamics of the legislative process as a means for making change.</p><p>Each student will work as an intern with a legislator and her or his staff for a regular 40-hour work week during the 2018 legislative session. Intensive staff-apprenticeship activities include conducting legislative research, drafting policy and other documents, bill tracking, and constituent communications. Responsibilities also include attendance at guest presentations, seminars, workshops on budget, and media panels. Students accepted as legislative interns will develop an internship learning contract, profiling legislative responsibilities and linkages to their academic development.</p><p>Each intern will keep a weekly journal that is submitted to the faculty sponsor regularly and a portfolio of all materials related to legislative work submitted upon faculty request. During regular in-capitol seminars, Evergreen interns will confer with colleagues and the faculty sponsor to address challenges and reflect upon their experiences. Each intern will translate his or her activities in the internship into analytic and reflective writing about what they are learning and implications of the work by producing a minimum of three short essays per quarter. Students will also write a self-evaluation at the end of each quarter. At the conclusion of the legislative session, interns will produce a substantial integrative essay and meet with colleagues in person to review and reflect upon their legislative internship experience.</p><p>Student performance for the internship is evaluated by the faculty sponsor, field supervisors, and legislative office staff.</p></description>

    <description><p>This program is an opportunity for students to do intermediate or advanced work in the humanities and social sciences with the support of a peer group. Students will work independently or in small groups on in-depth research projects or topics. This work may include an internship if the student has already identified an outside agency or organization and a potential field supervisor.</p><p>Students will meet weekly as a group with faculty to discuss work and support other group members&apos; work. Weekly meetings may also include seminar readings and discussion. Some time will be devoted to writing drafts of Academic Statements.</p></description>
