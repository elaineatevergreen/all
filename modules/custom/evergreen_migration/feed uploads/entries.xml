Once, while learning how to shoot video, I dumped a TV monitor onto the sidewalk outside the Mods. Crash! I had to pay for a new one--ouch. But someone at Media Loan helped arrange payments, and hired me to work off a part of the debt. I learned to be more careful with the equipment--and I learned I could get help when I needed it. I learned I could make life-long friends with my teachers--hey there, Rudy Martin!--and my fellow students: ditto, Steve Blakeslee. i learned that no matter where I go, no matter what I do, I&apos;ll always have a piece of Evergreen&apos;s heart in my heart, helping to show me the way.

I see connections others don’t see, and love the Rasta wisdom that “Everything is Everything.” I also continue to read and explore a wide range of subject matter.

Historical materialism is systems thinking applied to the ebb and flow of history. It would be more widely understood if not for fear and politics. Of course the means of producing influences who we are and what we think! Behavior, as Kurt Lewin pointed out, is a function of personality times the environment (with the environment being the heavier influence). No one today thinks the world is flat, even though that would have been a given in certain cultures 4000 years ago. We are a product of our times and our immediate circumstances. If you are at the bottom of a hierarchy you will probably cope with stress through the defense mechanism of fight (with it’s obvious potential consequences), or the more likely defense mechanism of flight (by fleeing inward - keeping your mouth shut, trying to keep out of harm’s way). We are constantly in systems, and influenced by them. Evergreen gave me a deep understanding of that.

Finally, working in small groups, getting direct faculty contact, the whole Evergreen approach to learning fit my needs and increased my confidence greatly.</Field37><DateUpdated>2011-04-04 12:50:47</DateUpdated></Entry><Entry><EntryId>160</EntryId><Field380></Field380><Field41>Angel </Field41><Field42>D.

Evergreen State College, as a interdisciplinary school, allowed me full and complete access to equipment, internet, scholars, foreign students, marketing avenues and the world in general, with free reign yet under the guidance of caring and knowledgeable professors.

Having access to the world via the large and diverse foreign student population alone was of great asset. Employing the use of a statistics class enabled me to design an unbiased survey which would elicit honest answers, therefore honest results from a large diverse geographical, economic and cultural population. Posing as a student allowed me access to interviews and leaders of companies and organizations who would have been challenging to approach if I had not been a student.

As a student, to be able to locate and access linguist specialists, lexicographers, librarians, business professors, typesetters, graphic designers, book binders, leaders in public administration, language specialists, teachers of many schools across the world and students new to this country learning English as a Foreign Language (ESL) was absolutely invaluable! Having access to the computers and software alone to design the interior of the dictionary, web pages, maneuver around on the internet for research allowed me access to penetrate a world which became my playground. The more I learned, the less I feared. My passion for my project grew enormously as I gained confidence that my undertaking would not be in vain and may actually succeed if I persevered.

My access to students with various learning disabilities as well as those who were learning English as a first and second language combined well with my previous experience as a tutor of literacy within community colleges at four various states over the years. I designed the methodology for the book while at Evergreen and did not deviate from this design nary once in the 10 years of growing this phonetic dictionary to a 35,000 word base. As much as I tried, my thorough research and development which I originated as a student could not have been designed any better. The original design is thorough and fully functional. Not a one person has come up with a better idea to change the algorithm.

&quot;Gabby&apos;s Wordspeller &amp; Phonetic Dictionary&quot; is the first, only. true American English Phonetic Dictionary which invites you to &apos;find your word by the way it sounds&apos;. My favorite responses from those who have purchased it are, &quot;Awesome Book!&quot; and &quot;This is the bridge we have needed to enable people access standard dictionaries!&quot;. Within two months by &apos;word of mouth&apos; marketing, this dictionary has already captured the attention and acceptance of the Texas Department of Education, Dylsexia.com, Dyslexia.org, Tacoma School District, Thurston County WorkSource Learning Disabilities, U of W Bookstore, National Association of Secondary School Principals, Colima University, Colima, Mexico, public libraries across the country as well as teachers, literacy centers, people in the trades, librarians and especially students of ESL. The genre&apos; this dictionary has already penetrated incorporates the nation and any country who speaks ESL.

Becoming a self-publisher and forming my own publishing company, DaMeFRANK Publishing has definitely had its rewards. I studied the publishing market while at TESC and had resolved to self-publish then and there. Knowledge provides comfort. And experiential knowledge is now my wisdom. I have created a FIRST and an original. By having studied my market I was enlightened as to why there has not and will not exist a phonetic dictionary for a long time coming. My research and book was invited to become part of a committee by the International Phonetic Association (IPA). This association designs ISO codes which digital spell checkers and dictionaries use today. I also became aware, while conducting my feasibility study at TESC, that this style of resource tool would be a bit of a hard sell at the beginning. Not only was I introducing to the world a &apos;new concept&apos; but would also be educating them to the efficiency and speed this tool would lend to those who could not find their word within seconds with digital spell checkers and dictionaries.

There are today, forums full of people airing their complaints about the inadequacies of spell checkers. And although I am not allowed to promote commercially my book on a large percentage of these sites, I am quietly humbled that I have created a tool which will help millions once they catch wind that &quot;Gabby&apos;s&quot; exists. This is going to be a fun ride!</Field37><DateUpdated>2011-04-04 12:28:21</DateUpdated></Entry><Entry><EntryId>195</EntryId><Field380>Okay</Field380><Field41>Don </Field41><Field42>Freas</Field42><Field34>BA1991</Field34><Field375>Arts, Design, Entertainment, Sports and Media</Field375><Field378>Select One</Field378><Field4>Design and Fabrication: ONe-of-a-kind Furniture and Sculpture </Field4><Field3>Don Freas Design</Field3><Field7>PO Box 11951</Field7><Field9>Olympia</Field9><Field10>WA</Field10><Field23>don@donfreas.com</Field23><Field49></Field49><Field6>1974- present</Field6><Field25></Field25><Field37>I started at Evergreen in 1972, came back and graduated in 1991.

Today brings yet another one of those inevitable changes, as I am officially moving on from my current role with ActiveRain.

I have thoroughly enjoyed working with the ActiveRain team, and all of the members, to build ActiveRain to what it is today. Right now, I have an opportunity in front of me that is too good to pass up. I will be founding a new, yet-to-be-announced social networking/media startup outside of the real estate industry. Similar to with ActiveRain and real estate, I see a very large market that has some unique problems in need of a solution and and it&apos;s shocking no one has previously put all of the pieces together. You will be hearing much more about it soon enough, and I look forward to being able to build something as passionately as I have been able to help build with ActiveRain.

While I will be officially moving on from my current role with ActiveRain, I will continue to have an active role with the company, working on various projects. You will still see me around as I plan on attending as many of the industry events and gatherings as I can going forward. I have also been asked to remain on the Board of ActiveRain and will continue in that capacity. I look forward to making continuing contributions to ActiveRain as it continues its exciting progress – not just because I&apos;m one of the company’s largest shareholders but because I love the community.

Also, Doranne Crable remained a role model for me for many years during and after college, sharing her unique insight, giving me new perspectives on each situation I encountered.</Field37><DateUpdated>2012-06-20 12:22:29</DateUpdated></Entry><Entry><EntryId>258</EntryId><Field380></Field380><Field41>Carmen</Field41><Field42>Lane</Field42><Field34>BA 2003</Field34><Field375>Personal Care and Service</Field375><Field378></Field378><Field4>Day Spa </Field4><Field3>Good Karma Enterprises Inc/ Three Cedars Day Spa</Field3><Field7>3317 Pacific Ave </Field7><Field9>Tacoma</Field9><Field10>WA</Field10><Field23>info@threecedarsdayspa.com</Field23><Field49></Field49><Field6></Field6><Field25></Field25><Field37></Field37><DateUpdated>2013-02-20 10:30:03</DateUpdated></Entry><Entry><EntryId>259</EntryId><Field380>Okay</Field380><Field41>Daniel R.</Field41><Field42>Lassley</Field42><Field34>BA 1987</Field34><Field375>Sales and Related</Field375><Field378>Select One</Field378><Field4>Used Books Sales and Computer Services </Field4><Field3>Lassley&apos;s Books Inc, TRACS Inc, NW Pioneer Construction LLC</Field3><Field7>909 SLeater Kinney Rd SE</Field7><Field9>Lacey</Field9><Field10>WA</Field10><Field23></Field23><Field49></Field49><Field6>1989-present/2004-present</Field6><Field25></Field25><Field37></Field37><DateUpdated>2011-03-31 14:04:35</DateUpdated></Entry><Entry><EntryId>260</EntryId><Field380>Okay</Field380><Field41>Leslie</Field41><Field42>Layton</Field42><Field34>BA 1975</Field34><Field375>Education, Training and Library</Field375><Field378>Select One</Field378><Field4>Bilingual Online Magazine </Field4><Field3>ChicoSol</Field3><Field7>48 Forest Creek Circle</Field7><Field9>Chico </Field9><Field10>CA</Field10><Field23>chicosol@sbcglobal.net</Field23><Field49></Field49><Field6>2007-present</Field6><Field25></Field25><Field37></Field37><DateUpdated>2011-03-31 14:04:11</DateUpdated></Entry><Entry><EntryId>261</EntryId><Field380>Okay</Field380><Field41>Nick</Field41><Field42>Ledbetter</Field42><Field34>BA 1977</Field34><Field375>Legal</Field375><Field378>Select One</Field378><Field4>Automated court records retrieval and process integration </Field4><Field3>CourtTrac Corporation</Field3><Field7>15400 SE 30th PL</Field7><Field9>Bellevue</Field9><Field10>WA</Field10><Field23>nick.ledbetter@courttrax.com</Field23><Field49></Field49><Field6>2000-present</Field6><Field25></Field25><Field37>“Learn as you go!” Learn what you need to get it done.</Field37><DateUpdated>2011-03-31 14:04:01</DateUpdated></Entry><Entry><EntryId>262</EntryId><Field380></Field380><Field41>Edward S. </Field41><Field42>Lemar</Field42><Field34>BA 2001</Field34><Field375>Arts, Design, Entertainment, Sports and Media</Field375><Field378></Field378><Field4>Music and Arts Festival</Field4><Field3>Feel Good Music Festival</Field3><Field7>440  Bukolt Ave </Field7><Field9>Stevens Point </Field9><Field10>WI</Field10><Field23>info@feelgoodfestival.org</Field23><Field49></Field49><Field6></Field6><Field25></Field25><Field37></Field37><DateUpdated>2012-04-16 12:26:49</DateUpdated></Entry><Entry><EntryId>263</EntryId><Field380>Okay</Field380><Field41>Candace</Field41><Field42>Lemon</Field42><Field34>BA 2002</Field34><Field375>Hospitality (lodging food and beverage)</Field375><Field378>Community and Social Services</Field378><Field4>lodging</Field4><Field3>Durango Hometown Hostel</Field3><Field7>736 Goeglein Gulch Road</Field7><Field9>Durango</Field9><Field10>CO</Field10><Field23>info@durangohometownhostel.com</Field23><Field49>The Durango Hometown Hostel sleeps 26 in four dorm rooms.

The world exponentially expands through inquiry, collaboration, research, dialog... Starting and operating my own business has been very much the same. Evergreen taught me to be flexible, creative and to not shy away from the untidiness of life-the questions that have no clean answer, the endeavors that seem improbable or impossible at the outset. After the who-what-when-where of the things I learned in college have receded from my mind, it is the intangible way-of being-in-the-world stance that I developed during my time at Evergreen that remains.</Field37><DateUpdated>2011-03-31 14:03:14</DateUpdated></Entry><Entry><EntryId>264</EntryId><Field380>Okay</Field380><Field41>Mike</Field41><Field42>Lempriere</Field42><Field34>BS</Field34><Field375>Computer, Technology and Web</Field375><Field378>Select One</Field378><Field4>Computer website hosting</Field4><Field3>Vinters.Net</Field3><Field7>8840 NE Lovgren Rd</Field7><Field9>Bainbridge Island </Field9><Field10>WA</Field10><Field23>mike@vonters.net</Field23><Field49></Field49><Field6></Field6><Field25></Field25><Field37></Field37><DateUpdated>2011-03-31 14:02:37</DateUpdated></Entry><Entry><EntryId>265</EntryId><Field380>Okay</Field380><Field41>Barbara</Field41><Field42>Levy</Field42><Field34>BA 1982</Field34><Field375>Arts, Design, Entertainment, Sports and Media</Field375><Field378>Select One</Field378><Field4>Print and Web Design</Field4><Field3>Stepping Stone Grapics</Field3><Field7>9028 6th Ave NW </Field7><Field9>Seattle</Field9><Field10>WA</Field10><Field23>barb@steppingstonegraphics.com</Field23><Field49></Field49><Field6>1990-present</Field6><Field25></Field25><Field37></Field37><DateUpdated>2011-03-31 14:02:28</DateUpdated></Entry><Entry><EntryId>266</EntryId><Field380>Okay</Field380><Field41>Anne </Field41><Field42>Lewin</Field42><Field34>BA 1975</Field34><Field375>Sales and Related</Field375><Field378>Select One</Field378><Field4>Custom Framing: Music, Film, Photography &amp; Art ( including some original vintage) </Field4><Field3>Innervisions Poster and Framing</Field3><Field7>4548 University Way NE</Field7><Field9>Seattle </Field9><Field10>WA</Field10><Field23>shop@posterhound.com</Field23><Field49></Field49><Field6>open for 32 years</Field6><Field25></Field25><Field37></Field37><DateUpdated>2011-03-31 14:02:16</DateUpdated></Entry><Entry><EntryId>267</EntryId><Field380>Okay</Field380><Field41>Benjamin T. </Field41><Field42>Lincoln </Field42><Field34>BA 1986</Field34><Field375>Installation, Maintenance and Repair</Field375><Field378>Select One</Field378><Field4>Gutter Cleaning</Field4><Field3>Benjamin Lincooln &amp; Denise Hood Lincoln Gutter Cleanign and Repair</Field3><Field7>3702 South Fifer St #3</Field7><Field9>Tacoma</Field9><Field10>WA</Field10><Field23>Lincolngutters@msn.com</Field23><Field49></Field49><Field6>1992-present</Field6><Field25></Field25><Field37>Evergreen allowed me to study a variety of academic areas until that little voice inside got loud enough for me to figure out where my passion and bliss might be found.

We recently moved to our new facilities at 7400 3rd Avenue South, in the South Park area of Seattle!

Since 1979, Oppenheimer has been the name for quality camera rental in the Pacific Northwest and beyond. We began with one camera in 1979, and today have the largest camera rental inventory north of Los Angeles. In fact, our film camera inventory exceeds that of all our competitors combined!

We have always worked to be innovators, not just in our regional marketplace, but in the world. We were the first rental house outside Los Angeles to provide the Moviecam SL camera, Cooke S4 Lenses, Angenieux Optimo Lenses, Panasonic SDX-900&apos;s and more. We have always been first in the region with most of the equipment we provide, and we consider it a compliment to see others copy our innovations.

2006 brings lots of great new changes at Oppenheimer Cine Rental, including the move to our new facility!

We are the largest and most experienced rental house north of Los Angeles, dedicated to making your production experience in the Pacific Northwest, or anywhere in the US or Canada, the best it can possibly be. In 2005, we supported films and video productions all across the western US and western Canada. We promise you factory trained camera technicians, competitive pricing, and the finest customer support.</Field49><Field6>197-present</Field6><Field25></Field25><Field37></Field37><DateUpdated>2014-02-18 08:52:02</DateUpdated></Entry><Entry><EntryId>358</EntryId><Field380>Okay</Field380><Field41>Craig</Field41><Field42>Otavelli</Field42><Field34>BA 1997</Field34><Field375>Community and Social Services</Field375><Field378>Select One</Field378><Field4>Consulting Services</Field4><Field3>OrgSupport, LLC </Field3><Field7>120 State Ave NE #303</Field7><Field9>Olympia</Field9><Field10>WA</Field10><Field23>craig@OrgSupport.com</Field23><Field49>I provide low-cost staffing services for small and emerging non-profits, foundations and non-governmental organizations</Field49><Field6>2006-present</Field6><Field25></Field25><Field37>The educational environment at Evergreen is rigorously academic but at the same time reflective of the real world.

Jerry Black is a retired Northwest Airlines pilot and Marian Palaia is currently a program coordinator with the Office for Civic Engagement at the University of Montana. We are both animal lovers, though Jerry (being retired) has a little more time to advocate on their behalf, and is not shy about doing so. After we were introduced last winter by mutual friend Susan Waite, we quickly settled into a Sunday morning dog hiking routine with Jerry’s three dogs, Dawson, Bo Bo and Chase (he also has two cats, two kids and a grandson), and Marian’s dog Tupelo (no other animals or offspring, by design). Last February, Jerry returned from a tracking course in the Swan, having made the startling and intriguing discovery that not only does moose poop burn quite a lot like incense, it actually smells good when it burns. Like willow, or sweetgrass, or dogwood. After about a ten-minute business-planning session/hike in the North Hills, Moose-Cense was born. Jerry originally wanted to box up the poop in clear plastic containers, but Marian, with absolutely no prior knowledge of marketing, design, or anything even remotely related, commandeered the role of artistic director. The result, which has been a process of experimentation and discovery, is what you will find on this site. Pretty soon we are going to be selling t-shirts, caps, coffee mugs and bags. For the systems, we will make every effort to continue using sustainable or found materials, and fashioning as much of our product ourselves as we can manage. In other words, neither of us is the least bit interested in mass production, or going all Beanie Baby with this shit. It is not an exact science, so the only promise we can make is that we will try our best. We will also be donating a portion of our profits (in the event we actually start making some of those) to Northwest Connections, whose tracking course was the catalyst for this venture. We are open to suggestion and collaboration, and would love to ultimately have as close to a totally made in Montana product as possible. We also want to keep it fun and uncomplicated, as it has been (mostly) up to now, which is not to say it has been easy and worry-free, but what the heck is? We are also looking into a small business loan to buy our own moose, but then we will need a place to keep it. Once we have a place big enough to keep a moose, we will probably need to get some more dogs. Stay tuned.</Field49><Field6>2008-present</Field6><Field25></Field25><Field37></Field37><DateUpdated>2011-03-25 13:49:38</DateUpdated></Entry><Entry><EntryId>361</EntryId><Field380>Okay</Field380><Field41>Terese</Field41><Field42>Palaia</Field42><Field34>1982</Field34><Field375>Farming, Fishing and Forestry</Field375><Field378>Select One</Field378><Field4>Retail Greenhouse/ Nursery</Field4><Field3>Blue Moon Garden and Nursery LLC</Field3><Field7>1732 S Inland Empire Way</Field7><Field9>Spokane</Field9><Field10>WA</Field10><Field23></Field23><Field49>“Blue Moon Garden and Nursery is a full service nursery and garden center just southwest of downtown Spokane.

Say This Say That was founded in 2005 in an effort to design simple, but elegant web sites and print materials for artists, musicians, non-profits and start-up businesses. After a few years as a freelance operation, the founder decided it was pointless to compete with other freelance designers in such a small community. Instead, an alliance was created with local designers who shared the same design ideals and could work collaboratively as a design collective.

Some may consider this alliance a form of ‘synergy’, but we prefer to call it design Voltron.… We don&apos;t just build websites, we make affordable design solutions for the creative community that are easy to use, update, and enjoy.</Field49><Field6>2005-present</Field6><Field25></Field25><Field37></Field37><DateUpdated>2011-03-25 13:47:57</DateUpdated></Entry><Entry><EntryId>367</EntryId><Field380>Okay</Field380><Field41>Rebecca</Field41><Field42>Pearcy</Field42><Field34>Ba 1995</Field34><Field375>Sales and Related</Field375><Field378>Select One</Field378><Field4>Design and Manufacture of Bags, Wallets and Accessories</Field4><Field3>Queen Bee Inc</Field3><Field7>1847 E.

A far cry from fortune telling or &apos;interpreting&apos; as one would comment about a painting in a museum, there is a real art and science to understanding the meaning of our dreams. They hold very practical insights and applicable solutions to our daily life, and being able to tap into this can provide a wealth of information to improve a person’s life. Dreams can provide answers to difficult questions, give new perspectives on relationships and circumstances, and even generate creative ideas. I love to educate people about their dreams by holding dream groups and workshops, consulting 1:1, and being a radio guest to spread the word even further.</Field49><Field6>1993-present</Field6><Field25></Field25><Field37></Field37><DateUpdated>2011-03-25 12:51:51</DateUpdated></Entry><Entry><EntryId>371</EntryId><Field380>Okay</Field380><Field41>Margaret</Field41><Field42>Philhower </Field42><Field34>BA 1995</Field34><Field375>Healthcare</Field375><Field378>Office and Administrative Support</Field378><Field4>Naturopathic Medical Offices</Field4><Field3>Margaret Philhower, ND</Field3><Field7>9335 Takilma Rd</Field7><Field9>Cave Junction</Field9><Field10>OR</Field10><Field23></Field23><Field49></Field49><Field6>2002-present</Field6><Field25></Field25><Field37></Field37><DateUpdated>2011-03-25 12:51:43</DateUpdated></Entry><Entry><EntryId>372</EntryId><Field380>Okay</Field380><Field41>Bob</Field41><Field42>Phillips</Field42><Field34>Ba 1986</Field34><Field375>Arts, Design, Entertainment, Sports and Media</Field375><Field378>Select One</Field378><Field4>Music Composition, Recording and Production</Field4><Field3>Bob Phillips Music</Field3><Field7>535 17th Ave E Unit 102</Field7><Field9>Seattle</Field9><Field10>WA</Field10><Field23>phillipsfiddlers@aol.com</Field23><Field49>Bob and Pam Phillips offer motivational and innovative educational programs for string teachers and students from around the country.

Soon thereafter, we were forced to move, and after three months in storage the studio was relocated to its current home, a sizable warehouse space tucked away in an industrial area of North Portland. In 2002, A year or so after settling into the new space, Jeremy Romagna, a co-founder of the now defunct Portland Robot Steakhouse joined on as the third engineer. The most recent addition, making Type Foundry a four engineer cooperative, is Dylan Magierek, formerly of Closer Recording, another collective studio in San Francisco, and also the head of Badman Recording Co.. Dylan&apos;s arrival catalyzed a major studio upgrade, in which we purchased our Trident Series 70 console, added tons of new gear, and shut down for two months in the summer of 2006 to build a 3rd tracking room.

( I also used the name for a single I released in the late 70&apos;s). At the beginning of 1998 (finally accepting that the income from playing top 40 is really dreadful!), I went back to school for a second degree as a computer network tech. Needing some kind of an income &amp; observing e-commerce on the usenet, I tried selling a few items from my collection, &amp; it took off from there! The response to Dandylion throughout the course of 1998 exceeded all of my expectations. I finally dropped out of School in November of 1998 to devote all my time to the business. Through 2000, we expanded to a level way beyond our expectations (&amp; sanity!). Unfortunately since spring of 2001 the economy has brought a significant downturn in our business, but with your support we plan to stick around for awhile &amp; keep providing you great music at affordable prices!

Our focus has always been a combination of affordably priced cd&apos;s along with some collectible&apos;s. In the last couple years we&apos;ve also added a selection of European cd&apos;s that are hard to find here in the US. While these are bit more expensive then the music we&apos;ve traditionally carried, they&apos;re still quite a bit cheaper then what most &quot;brick &amp; mortar&quot; stores charge for the same cd&apos;s! As a music lover &amp; collector, I&apos;ve spent many hours hunting down non-US cd&apos;s that I really wanted, but I normally had to pay $22-$30 for them! We&apos;re able to keep most of our UK cd&apos;s well below $20, even after importing them into the US; so we&apos;re still able to offer you an exceptional value! And when I mention in the introduction to a newsletter that I&apos;m excited about that week&apos;s collection - I really mean it! As a collector myself, I really enjoy &quot;the thrill of the chase&quot; (As Deep Purple would say!!).

What our subscribers receive each week in the newsletter is a list of everything new we&apos;ve gotten in since the last issue. if you notice some of the same titles frequently, it&apos;s because we sold out of that title &amp; got it back in. We&apos;ve also got around 3,000 titles available on our website &amp; ebay! We&apos;re hoping to be able to add a full checkout for instant purchase &amp; full descriptions to the website before the year is out.</Field49><Field6>1998-present</Field6><Field25></Field25><Field37></Field37><DateUpdated>2011-03-25 12:42:50</DateUpdated></Entry><Entry><EntryId>381</EntryId><Field380>Publish</Field380><Field41>David </Field41><Field42>Rauh</Field42><Field34>BA 1979</Field34><Field375>Arts, Design, Entertainment, Sports and Media</Field375><Field378></Field378><Field4>Radio station</Field4><Field3>Mixx 96.1 KXXO</Field3><Field7>119 Washington St NW</Field7><Field9>Olympia</Field9><Field10>WA</Field10><Field23>admin@mixx96.com</Field23><Field49></Field49><Field6>1990- present</Field6><Field25></Field25><Field37></Field37><DateUpdated>2012-05-11 18:58:42</DateUpdated></Entry><Entry><EntryId>382</EntryId><Field380>Publish</Field380><Field41>Caroline</Field41><Field42>Ravines</Field42><Field34>1978</Field34><Field375>Hospitality (lodging food and beverage)</Field375><Field378></Field378><Field4>Small Baking Business</Field4><Field3>Biscotti for Everybotti</Field3><Field7>754 Hillside Avenue</Field7><Field9>Rochester</Field9><Field10>NY</Field10><Field23>biscotti.everybody@gmail.com</Field23><Field49>Biscotti for Everybotti is a small baking business specializing in the creation of gourmet biscotti using organic and natural ingredients.

So honored, our students discover and learn to use their natural gifts. They develop a deep sense of self by creating meaningful expressions of their passions in the world.

I believe animals have  much to teach us. I want to share a quote from Chief Dan George that speaks very much to my sentiments for this enterprise and my endeavors: 
If you talk to the animals they will talk to you
and you will know each other.
If you do not talk to them, you will not know them.
And what you do not know you will fear.
What one fears, one destroys.</Field49><Field6></Field6><Field25></Field25><Field37>Evergreen was a great experience. Its best gift to students is that it can teach students about what life is about, what it is really about and how to stand up and do something that you really love and benefit others and the planet. It sounds grandiose but it really isn&apos;t. I am so proud when I read about my fellow Greeners, no matter the year of their time at Evergreen they inspire me and the funny thing is that I am doing my own thing and it&apos;s good work. So, my best story is one that at the time was incredibly negative. In a nutshell my professor, a man I idolized and respected in many ways became ill with cancer. I worked as his Research Assistant on some high profile reports for the U.S. State Senate on drug treatment and anti-drug use for children. This was during Nancy Reagan&apos;s Just Say No Crusade. So, he got sick and I was in his program. He expected me to sacrifice being a student in his program (I was a Junior at that time) and teach his program so he could save face, get his salary etc. I refused. I attempted to address a plan with the other students. They turned on me and labeled me as the ringleader. These were people I was incredibly close with. I was forced to drop out of a really great program and he wrote me the worst evaluation of my life. I can&apos;t tell you all the horrible things he said about me under the guise of a &quot;faculty evaluation&quot;. If I had accepted that evaluation I wouldn&apos;t even be able to work at Wal-mart. Never mind having any self respect. I took action and met with Mike Beug, the Dean of Faculty at the time. He did me proud, took on this issue and resolved what could have been a very bad situation. Prior to this he and this person were good friends and he had known this person for many years. But he did not hesitate, he did not question what I said. He had to threaten to fire this person, take away his Evergreen pension, accuse him of breaking the Evergreen Social Contract. This person backed down and while the evaluation did not really highlight the great work I did in my internship with the Washington Dept. of Economic Development it was much improved. Mike Beug did his job and he did it in a most noble and non ego based way. He literally saved my educational future and he is someone I immediately think of right after I tell someone that yes, Evergreen is the best school in the Universe. </Field37><DateUpdated>2011-11-04 16:50:26</DateUpdated></Entry><Entry><EntryId>417</EntryId><Field380>Okay</Field380><Field41>Joy</Field41><Field42>Alboro</Field42><Field34>B.A. 2008</Field34><Field375>Healthcare</Field375><Field378>Counseling and Therapy</Field378><Field4>Healing, NLP, Hypnotherapy</Field4><Field3>In Joy Full Living</Field3><Field7></Field7><Field9></Field9><Field10></Field10><Field23>JoyNora@aol.com</Field23><Field49></Field49><Field6></Field6><Field25></Field25><Field37></Field37><DateUpdated>2011-03-24 14:17:25</DateUpdated></Entry><Entry><EntryId>418</EntryId><Field380>Okay</Field380><Field41>Dylan</Field41><Field42>Beal</Field42><Field34>BA 1991</Field34><Field375>Hospitality (lodging food and beverage)</Field375><Field378>Select One</Field378><Field4>Wine importer/distributor</Field4><Field3>Millesime</Field3><Field7>3430 4th Avenue South</Field7><Field9>Seattle</Field9><Field10>WA</Field10><Field23>dylan@millesimevinsfins.com</Field23><Field49>Millésime is a &apos;Micro-Importer&apos; of European wines, founded by Dylan Beal in 2004.

The press was established using letterpress technology and continues to be a letterpress-only shop today. I volunteered and apprenticed with Jocelyn beginning in 1989. At her death in 2003, I inherited the business and have continued her custom letterpress practice with a new emphasis on design. I also produce a growing stationery product line. 

I use a Heidelberg Windmill 10 x 15 platen letterpress, a Chandler and Price 10 x 15 New Series platen letterpress, and a handful of other small presses for special applications. The press has a collection of fourteen cabinets of metal typefaces, many of them rare. In addition, I employ a photopolymer printing plate system that enables me to print digitally set graphics and type on the old presses. This enhances the flexibility and breadth of the work that can be produced.

The press specializes in spot-color printing on fine papers. Business cards and wedding stationery are a focus. Small literary projects are welcome, as well. 

A lot of customers come to The Sherwood Press because they can get complete service from design to print at a small, local, woman-owned business. Customers enjoy the personal attention and the efficient, collaborative design process that I offer to those who want it.

I am happy to offer tours of this historic business, and I am also available for teaching workshops in basic letterpress technique, intermediate letterpress technique, and printing from photopolymer plates.</Field49><Field6>1940 - 2009</Field6><Field25></Field25><Field37>I engaged in four independent learning contracts during my five quarters at Evergreen.

At the time, Ethan was in Seattle as an invited guest speaker at the Translations Film Festival. Together they recognized that there was a gap in archiving historical and present day images of transgender people in video from around the world. They realized that there should be a widely accessible space that people could go to understand a history that has yet to be fully explored through video and film. Transreel is the outcome of these talks and is a repository of snapshots of history that documents the transgender movement from its inception. It is our hope that these his/her-stories provide a path for transgender and non-transgender individuals to create a more accepting world. Through the courage that surfaces from within these stories, we are each able to tap into our own courage as we experience the struggles and triumphs experienced by those from the past, so that together, we can move as a collective and create spaces and dialogues for generations to come.

I manage the retreat which hosts workshops for small groups in spiritual and personal growth, and also lead workshops here in Conscious Communication and Buddhist Insight Meditation – two of my life long passions.
(www.SkyMeadowRetreat.com) 

I have taught interpersonal communication and conflict resolution skills at the Community College of Vermont and other settings since 1990.  I have just published a book called Conscious Communication – How to Establish Healthy Relationships and Resolve Conflict Peacefully while Maintaining Independence. (2010 - Langdon St. Press - www.LanguageofConnection.com) 

The afterword of my book contains a personal account of my interest in resolving conflicts and improving relationships through more effective communication.  In writing this I realized that the seeds of collective decision making and collaborative negotiations were planted at Evergreen in the two programs I participated in. 

In describing my experiences at Evergreen I have told the story numerous times of how our class picked a graduation speaker.  I saw a poster for a meeting of seniors to choose a class speaker for graduation and was interested. When I got to the meeting I was surprised to see some students there that I knew, as I had no real idea who at Evergreen was a senior. (An aspect of Evergreen that I loved).  I was also disturbed by the process that unfolded at that meeting.

The faculty or administration person in charge was setting us up to choose a class speaker from among us by a process of voting.  Whomever was interested in being the speaker was invited to get up and present their case. It began to feel much like a contest or political election with each of us competing against the other to see who could garner the most attention or admiration.

I remember being very upset and interrupting the meeting with my objections (as I was known to do at Evergreen).  I suggested that this was not what we did at Evergreen and pleaded for a more collaborative and inclusive process.  The meeting seemed split with some students agreeing with me and others wanting a more familiar quick and dirty competition and majority vote.  We ended up dividing into two camps and agreed that one group would vote on a single speaker while the other group would continue to meet until we came up with a process we felt good about to choose a second speaker.

Our renegade group, who we felt represented the core values of Evergreen, met weekly and discussed different messages that we would like to see at our graduation.  After many meetings we decided our speaker would be three of us – each delivering our own part of a three part medley graduation speech.  We felt great, and our speech was a beautiful elegant exercise in the lessons of collective decision making we found so valuable at Evergreen.

I was very proud to be one of the three speakers, walking up on stage in my defiant way, barefoot, as I usually was at Evergreen.  I was grateful to the powers that be at Evergreen who allowed us to exercise the part of our education that we believed in most.


I would appreciate a mention of my book and  retreat center in the Alumni News and Evergreen Magazine and anywhere else that is appropriate.   Attached is an article I have written about conflict resolution and communication skills that I would love to see in the Evergreen Magazine or other publication.  I am also available to teach intensive workshops in Conflict Resolution or Communication Skills for students, staff, or faculty at Evergreen.

Thank you for your time and attention, 

Miles Sherts – Evergreen State College class of 1979

Welcome to Wild Lotus Yoga. Serving yoga to New Orleans since 2002 and sharing the most extensive selection of  yoga offerings in the Gulf South. Our intention is to turn ourselves and our community on to living an inspired, creative, and passionate life through yoga and related healing arts. We offer a wide variety of over 50 classes a week for all levels of experience including daily discounted and donation-based community classes. Classes are guided by a friendly staff of skilled teachers sharing inspiration through diverse styles of yoga.  Home of our signature Soul School Teacher Training Program which emphasizes the art of bringing soul and imagination to teaching yoga.  More than a yoga studio - also a home to integrative holistic workshops, music concerts, films, community service, and other special events to nourish the body, mind, and soul.

Sean Johnson And The Wild Lotus Band:
New Orleans mantra musicians Sean Johnson and The Wild Lotus Band are a critically acclaimed kirtan trio appreciated equally for the spiritual depth and dynamic musicality of their sound. Yoga Journal has praised the band, “A joy to listen to whether you’re a yogi or anyone who appreciates wildly creative music.” Yoga Chicago says, &quot;Their music will ignite the world...a hybrid of East and West that will bring joy to your heart and get your body boogieing.&quot; Sean and the band&apos;s latest album Devaloka was released by Nettwerk/Nutone Music- home of Sarah McLaughlin, Barenaked Ladies, Krishna Das, Jai Uttal and many other great artists.  The band’s unique music evocatively blends ancient eastern mantras with western musical taste, passionate vocals, funky grooves, and dreamy melodies. Their innovative approach to chant music transcends genres—shades of rock, jazz, funk, choral, Indian, Irish, Middle Eastern, and folk styles merge effortlessly with the magic of the mantras. Yoga City NYC says, “Their music is capable of being energetic, grounding, mellow, tender, sweet- eerie, rapturous and blissful all at once.” 

Vocalist and harmonium player Sean Johnson is the founder of the band. He’s been leading kirtan across the U.S. and abroad for over a decade. His  voice is equally influenced by vocal exploration of his ancestral Irish heritage as well as study in Indian vocal music and love of the path of bhakti yoga-- the yoga of the heart. Sean is also the founder of Wild Lotus Yoga Studio and Soul School, a yoga and spirituality teacher training program in his native New Orleans. He has a Master’s degree from The Naropa Institute with a focus on teaching chant as spiritual practice. He shares the practice of mantra in an inviting and accessible way that taps into the universal spirit of life and music- weaving stories, myths, and poetry. Grammy nominated kirtan artist Jai Uttal says “Sean’s voice is a warm, soothing river of serenity.” 

Bass and guitar player and New Orleans&apos; native Alvin Young spent years on the fabled Crescent City music scene playing with Wynton and Branford Marsalis, local legends James Booker and James Black and many more. His voice on bass and guitar weaves the jazz, rock, classical, and folk styles he&apos;s been immersed in for the last 35 years. The hallmark of Alvin&apos;s expression on the bass is a rare and deeply melodic quality that illuminates the trio&apos;s sound. 

Percussionist and singer Gwendolyn Colman brings a unique ethnic sound to the band with years of experience drumming with Middle Eastern ensembles, flamenco troupes, and avant garde bands. Her ‘ride’ includes frame drums, cajon, high hat, kick drum, doumbek, and karkobs, playing with merging ancient rhythms with a modern, urban flare. Gwendolyn can move seamlessly from a traditional middle eastern trance rhythm, to subtle jazz brushwork, to a New Orleans hip hop street groove. Her powerful vocals are influenced by early opera training. 

Together Sean, Alvin, and Gwendolyn create a contemporary world-spirit music that evokes and expands on the magic and mystical feelings first stirred in the pioneering golden age of East-West musical exploration in the 1960&apos;s.  The soul of New Orleans meets the spirit of India.

The band tours worldwide playing at music festivals, yoga studios, concert halls, retreat centers, and yoga conferences.

When traveling, we always have a better, more authentic time when there is a local connection. That is why we decided to become just that, your personal link to the islands of Dominica, Jamaica and St. Lucia. We know that every traveler is unique so we&apos;ll work with you to design your perfect escape. From accommodations to restaurants to activities, it is our business to know all that these islands offer.

As practitioners of yoga we are thrilled to have found a variety of lovely properties to work with that are conducive to hosting yoga retreats.  We enjoy the partnerships we have created with instructors and studios to offer a diverse calendar of retreats. We know what an amazing, transformational experience a retreat week can be and take pride in doing all we can to create a positive experience for everyone involved.

Having become part of the communities where we operate, it is important to us to be able to offer you the convenience of an all-inclusive trip while passing your dollars on to the small, local businesses and service providers. Tropical Escapes believes in the pillars of responsible tourism - environmental integrity, social justice and economic development.

Tropical Escapes supports sustainable tourism by working with environmentally and socially conscious accommodations and service providers, by dealing directly with local taxi and tour guide associations and by encouraging activities that make use of the islands’ natural assets guaranteeing their importance to the economy. We support eco-tourism and participation in heritage tours due not only to the quality of these activities but also the positive longer term implications that this type of sustainable tourism has on the future of these countries.

We strive to tread carefully and help to preserve the spirit of the Caribbean by appreciating, celebrating and sharing the rich beauty and culture that these islands possess. </Field49><Field6>September 2005 - present</Field6><Field25></Field25><Field37>Evergreen encouraged me to follow my passions, to think outside the box and to be directly involved in creating the change you want to see in the world</Field37><DateUpdated>2011-08-25 17:08:19</DateUpdated></Entry><Entry><EntryId>471</EntryId><Field380>Publish</Field380><Field41>Joy</Field41><Field42>von Skepsgardh</Field42><Field34>1993</Field34><Field375>Business and Financial</Field375><Field378></Field378><Field4>Herbal Products and Business Consulting</Field4><Field3>Amazon Herb Shop and Living Visions</Field3><Field7>PO Box 155</Field7><Field9>Mount Shasta</Field9><Field10>CA</Field10><Field23>joy@LivingVisionsNow.com</Field23><Field49>Amazon Herb Shop - Wild-crafted, sustainably harvested herbs for foods, supplements and skin care.  www.AmazonHerbShop.com

Also the volunteer firefighter experience, student health medical assistant work-study job, and serving as a student leader (if that were ever possible at Evergreen!) all helped prepare me for a medical career.

I was the only grad that year to be applying for medical school, so it was a huge relief when I finally got that acceptance letter from the UW.  Needless to say, I was not the typical medical student.  I was the only one in my medical school class to take the medical ethics course, which was full of students of various other health professions. I designed a three-month-long independent study enabling me to be at sixteen different outpatient specialty clinics on a rotating basis.  I received honors in Geriatrics and Rehab Medicine.

My practice reflects my values, I hope.  I schedule usually no more than twelve patients per day, and actively discriminate in favor of the super-elderly.  I make house calls, ride my bike to work (yes, even most winter days) and I volunteer in leadership at our community hospital, covered hospital &quot;call&quot; for our local free clinic, served four years as medical director at our town&apos;s oldest nursing home, and cheerfully nag CEOs to change policies in favor of a smaller carbon footprint, healthier and more local food, bike paths, access to care for veterans, better communication/collaboration between doctors and between doctors and patients.  The work will never end, but I don&apos;t want it to.  Evergreen gave me exactly what I wanted: meaningful work.  I can&apos;t imagine ever fully retiring, which is as it should be.  It is a privilege and a joy to practice medicine, even in this difficult time.</Field37><DateUpdated>2011-08-25 13:17:45</DateUpdated></Entry><Entry><EntryId>501</EntryId><Field380>Publish</Field380><Field41>Julie</Field41><Field42>Anderson</Field42><Field34>2000</Field34><Field375>Personal Care and Service</Field375><Field378></Field378><Field4>Licensed Massage Practitioner</Field4><Field3>Healthinmind Massage </Field3><Field7>The Serendipity Building</Field7><Field9>Olympia</Field9><Field10>WA</Field10><Field23>healthinmindmassage@me.com</Field23><Field49>My practice is a mix of treatment and relaxation massage in addition to energy work.

Some of the latter now appear on SUITE 16.  I was only allowed to enroll as Part Time Student, but Don Chan evaluated me as having done the work of a Full Time Student and more, so eventually I petitioned for full credit, offering to pay the difference in tuition, and full credits were granted.  I was surprised when I looked up my credits and found I was within a few credits of graduating.  I went for it.  I participated in Graduation ceremonies and received my Bachelor of Arts Degree in Jun 1982, 20 years after I&apos;d have received it if I&apos;d stayed with my original class at Whitman College, which I left to go on tour to take the first song I wrote and recorded as The Fleetwoods, &quot;Come Softly To Me&quot; to Number One in the Nation. 

The Jazz Dance classes I taught and offered independently, on campus at Evergreen, became part of the nucleus around which TESC&apos;s Leisure Education Program developed, in which I taught and offered classes from Jazz to Disco,  Ballet to Swing, not to mention Modeling, Music Business, and Group A Cappella Doo Wop Singing. 

Before I graduated from TESC, I&apos;d already served as Adjunct Faculty of St. Martin&apos;s College (now University) where, for purposes of pay scale, my expertise, experience, education and accomplishments were evaluated as being the equivalent of a PhD, and I was appointed Sr. Lecturer 1 in the Discipline of Fine Arts (four years before I earned my BA at Evergreen in 1982).&lt;/span&gt;</Field37><DateUpdated>2011-10-21 19:25:19</DateUpdated></Entry><Entry><EntryId>522</EntryId><Field380>Publish</Field380><Field41>Caitlin</Field41><Field42>(Ochse) Fuller</Field42><Field34>1995</Field34><Field375>Healthcare</Field375><Field378></Field378><Field4>Oriental medicine (acupuncture &amp; herbal medicine), lifestyle education (nutrition counseling &amp; personal training), massage therapy, and other holistic therapies.</Field4><Field3>Thrive Wellness Health Center</Field3><Field7>3969 4th Avenue, suite 204</Field7><Field9>San Diego</Field9><Field10>CA</Field10><Field23>caitlin@thrivewellness.com</Field23><Field49></Field49><Field6></Field6><Field25></Field25><Field37></Field37><DateUpdated>2011-08-24 19:09:03</DateUpdated></Entry><Entry><EntryId>523</EntryId><Field380>Publish</Field380><Field41>Tom </Field41><Field42>Gilbert</Field42><Field34>2001</Field34><Field375>Organic Farming and Fishing</Field375><Field378>Environmental Services</Field378><Field4>Non-profit; social enterprise</Field4><Field3>Highfields Center for Composting</Field3><Field7>PO Box 503</Field7><Field9>Hardwick</Field9><Field10>Vermont</Field10><Field23>tom@highfieldscomposting.org</Field23><Field49>Highfields closes the loop on food and agricultural systems through technical and educational services, research and community programming in on-farm and municipal composting systems, as well as operates a composting facility in Hardwick, Vermont.

Three keys to success I learned at TESC: 1) You can figure out anything given the right resources, 2) There is someone out there that knows what you need to know (and can help you!) and you just need to find that person through networks. It may take some time but in the end it will be well worth it, and 3) Believe in yourself. If you succeeded only once, you can succeed again. Failures are a form of learning- figure out what you did wrong and learn from it there is no rule or law that states just because something did not work once it will never work. (Rule 3a is to know when to pack it in and call it a day. That can be very hard to do- but sometimes it is necessary to cut your losses and start over)</Field37><DateUpdated>2011-08-16 12:58:36</DateUpdated></Entry><Entry><EntryId>566</EntryId><Field380>Publish</Field380><Field41>Reno</Field41><Field42>Durham</Field42><Field34>1999</Field34><Field375>Retail</Field375><Field378>Arts, Design, Entertainment, Sports, and Media</Field378><Field4>Clothing Line</Field4><Field3>Heart Attack Culture</Field3><Field7>1117 Queen Street West</Field7><Field9>Toronto</Field9><Field10>ON-Ontatrio</Field10><Field23>info@HeartAttackCulture.com</Field23><Field49>Heart Attack shirts are custom designed and manufactured in Canada, Sweat Shop Free.

I worked for the State of Alaska in natural resource management and in fisheries for several years before I moved into the Alaskan wilderness, where we started our business in order to maintain the lifestyle we love. Caring for the environment, practicing sustainable natural resource extraction and forest stewardship were all areas where my education at Evergreen became valuable.  Besides my business, I have remained active in local, statewide, and national natural resource management issues having served on boards and volunteered my time and experience. My husband and I are proud of our business - as one of the only (and currently the largest) birch syrup producers in the world.

All Deep Green Wilderness programs take place aboard Orion, our 64’ wooden yawl. Orion is as beautiful and well kept today as she was in 1934 the year she was launched, and her traditional rig and design make her the perfect platform for teaching sailing.

Deep Green Wilderness offers a variety of education programs throughout the year. Each program is designed to highlight different aspects of the Salish Sea and take advantage of our beautiful vessel. Whether you are a teen hoping to get some college credit for the summer, a family that would like to learn to sail or a teacher who would like to get their class out on the water, join us onboard for the sailing experience of a lifetime.&lt;/span&gt;</Field49><Field6></Field6><Field25></Field25><Field37>&lt;span style=&quot;white-space: pre-wrap&quot;&gt;Evergreen reinforced in me the value of an education gained outside the classroom and encouraged me to approach a question through a diversity of fields.

The International Coach Federation (ICF) defines Life Coaching as &quot;...partnering with clients in a thought-provoking and creative process that inspires them to maximize their personal and professional potential.&quot;
In alignment with the Co-Active Coaching model, I see my coaching clients as intrinsically &quot;Creative, Resourceful &amp; Whole.&quot; We already have within each of us the ability to grow, change and continuously learn new things and transform our lives, but the limiting beliefs we subconsciously carry may keep us stuck and unable to move forward on our own. Through a lively blend of conversation and coaching exercises, our work together will enable you to clarify and define your authentic path, identify and release any limiting beliefs, and begin taking bold steps towards creating the life you&apos;re uniquely meant to live. Together, we&apos;ll examine your goals in a way that makes the coaching process valuable, revealing, energizing, occasionally provocative, deeply meaningful, and even fun!
My clients are typically women in their 20&apos;s, 30&apos;s and 40&apos;s who are ready to transform their lives and make meaningful, significant changes with the consistent support and objective, compassionate encouragement, reflection &amp; feedback of a trusted and qualified Certified Professional Life Coach.

</Field49><Field6></Field6><Field25></Field25><Field37>The program I was in at Evergreen brought together concepts and synthesized information &amp; experiences into a cohesive whole. I learned that absolutely everything is interrelated and interconnected, even if, from the outset the pieces seemed totally disparate-it&apos;s how I work as a Life Coach, too. And everything I&apos;ve learned in my life to this point-academically and in various modes of employment, as well as creatively, interpersonally, physically, emotionally and spiritually-is utterly relevant to the path I&apos;m now on as a Life Coach. It&apos;s what I illuminate with my clients in the coaching-that we are holistic beings; if one area of our lives feels unbalanced, everything has the potential to feel unbalanced, whereas deep contentedness in any area can positively feed into and transform our lives.</Field37><DateUpdated>2012-03-09 18:57:20</DateUpdated></Entry><Entry><EntryId>608</EntryId><Field380>Publish</Field380><Field41>Anya</Field41><Field42>Hankin</Field42><Field34>2002</Field34><Field375>Community and Social Services</Field375><Field378>Counseling and Therapy</Field378><Field4>Coaching and Consulting</Field4><Field3>Launch Creative Consulting</Field3><Field7></Field7><Field9>Portland</Field9><Field10>OR</Field10><Field23>Anya@LaunchCreativeConsulting.com</Field23><Field49>Launch Creative Consulting uses expressive arts therapy and conflict resolution practices to support individuals, organizations, and communities to connect with their purpose and passion, motivating people towards their greatest potential.

In the 15 or so years of business the business has grown to take on 3 other partners and various seasonal part time people, including a position for me in the office/shop.  I can apply my years of working in the office at Northwest Marine Technology and some time as executive assistant at Booshoot Gardens as well as using my years of boating and wooden boat experience in a professional arena.  Being married to the boss doesn&apos;t hurt either having seen the business change, grow and establish a good reputation throughout the Pacific Northwest and beyond.

I am still very good friends with the artistic director, who is now the head of a large theatre in Scotland. The work I did with Proteus included theatre work in prisons, with children, touring to provinces and more traditional theatrical productions. Guess what? Sixteen years later I am still doing the exact same thing - the Applied Theatre MA program I am in prepares us in a pedagogy very similar to Evergreen&apos;s, I am working with children and other non-dominant groups, I went to Denmark this summer to work with a touring children&apos;s theatre company, and I am working on Broadway doing more traditional theatre as well. It&apos;s because Evergreen allowed me to figure out what really interested me that I was able to train in a unique combination of theater, education, advocacy, community building and outreach that I continue to this day.</Field37><DateUpdated>2012-10-05 10:00:32</DateUpdated></Entry><Entry><EntryId>627</EntryId><Field380>Publish</Field380><Field41>Todd</Field41><Field42>Denny</Field42><Field34>1985</Field34><Field375>Life, Physical and Social Science</Field375><Field378>Sales and Related</Field378><Field4>Mind/Body Training</Field4><Field3>counscious Creations</Field3><Field7></Field7><Field9></Field9><Field10></Field10><Field23>todddennymsw@gmail.com</Field23><Field49>Helping students understand their minds to enjoy life and achieve greatness.</Field49><Field6></Field6><Field25></Field25><Field37>Creative, engaging education.</Field37><DateUpdated>2012-10-05 09:16:08</DateUpdated></Entry><Entry><EntryId>628</EntryId><Field380></Field380><Field41>Eddie</Field41><Field42>Spatz</Field42><Field34>1977</Field34><Field375>Retail</Field375><Field378></Field378><Field4>Hats for all</Field4><Field3>Bigg Hedd Edd&apos;s</Field3><Field7></Field7><Field9>Los Angeles</Field9><Field10>California</Field10><Field23>uop123edd@gmail.com</Field23><Field49>I envision a retail establishment in and outside of cyberspace.

By choice or by chance, many women will be single for a portion of their adult lives. Women who are alone because of eviction, home foreclosure, divorce, death of a spouse, single by choice, or alone in a marriage (through physical separation, disease, or estrangement) will find starting over or remaining stable less daunting in our residence.  
Oasis Home Residence has become the perfect respite to reestablish stability and hope during a seemingly hopeless time in the lives of the women we serve.  Oasis Home Residence welcomes women of all ages who need a safe, clean and comfortable home to renew mind, body and soul. We encourage understanding kinships and career employment by networking with other women in the community.  
Recently our organization received a letter of determination for a nonprofit status.  We are very excited to have this status because we can add needed services to the community of women we serve.  Presently, we have a 100% resident capacity because the need is so great. In addition to housing we have implemented workshops to help or residents acquire the tools and information that will influence their journey moving forward.

  Emily has trouble with her husband Gareth. Although she is both intelligent and beautiful, she lives with an embarrassing medical condition: Emily has Tourette syndrome. Thinking that Gareth therefore has all the power in their marriage, Emily allows him to treat her like the proverbial doormat.

  Emily’s son Reid also has Tourette syndrome. Academic problems and bullies make school a living hell. Only the support of his friends, other “weirdos” like him, makes it bearable. They plot revenge against the bullies. In a high achieving town where many consider only an Ivy League education acceptable, Reid wonders where a place in the world exists for someone like him.

  Emily accidentally enters an alternate dimension where she meets Terran. Compassionate, God-like, yet blinded by her fiery beauty, he becomes her spiritual teacher. Only someone with a life mission as important as hers, Terran says, can enter his dimension. Reid and Emily’s increasing prophetic visions lead them to healing in ways that they never expect.

On this site you will see crafts of superb quality from artisans who employ timeless techniques. In addition to seeking the finest work available, we emphasize the uncommon. Most items you will see on our website are not available in stores or online. We showcase work from producer groups whose traditions are little known in the United States. Each year we scout new locales to identify new artisans and traditions.

We’re dedicated to ensuring fair trade. The crafts are purchased directly from artisans, cooperatives, refugee communities, economic development initiatives and a limited number of wholesalers who subscribe to fair trade principles. Artisans are paid promptly, receive a fair wage by local standards and set the price for their work. Working conditions are clean, safe and accessible.</Field49><Field6>1999 - present</Field6><Field25></Field25><Field37>I learned to advocate for my think-outside-the-box ideas.</Field37><DateUpdated>2013-04-17 12:16:41</DateUpdated></Entry><Entry><EntryId>643</EntryId><Field380>Publish</Field380><Field41>Karyn</Field41><Field42>White</Field42><Field34>1998</Field34><Field375>Healthcare</Field375><Field378></Field378><Field4>Naturopathic Family Practice</Field4><Field3>Olympia Natural Medicine</Field3><Field7>145 Lilly Rd NE Suite 102</Field7><Field9>Olympia</Field9><Field10>WA</Field10><Field23>OlyNaturalMed@yahoo.com</Field23><Field49>Comprehensive Naturopathic primary care clinic for the whole family.</Field49><Field6>2004-present</Field6><Field25></Field25><Field37></Field37><DateUpdated>2013-04-17 12:16:25</DateUpdated></Entry><Entry><EntryId>644</EntryId><Field380>Publish</Field380><Field41>Alexandra</Field41><Field42>Espindola</Field42><Field34>1999</Field34><Field375>Arts, Design, Entertainment, Sports and Media</Field375><Field378>Sales and Related</Field378><Field4>Import</Field4><Field3>The Best Earring Holder</Field3><Field7>301 E Wall-Knee Blvd.</Field7><Field9>Shelton</Field9><Field10>wa</Field10><Field23>alexespind@earthlink.net</Field23><Field49>We design and import Guadua (Bamboo) products from South America.

Currently the industry produces cannabis indoors.  This requires vast amounts of power and is associated with producing 4600 pounds of carbon for each pound of cannabis, equal to driving a car across the US five times.  A single joint is equal to leaving a 100 watt light on for a day or driving 25 miles.  We have lobbied the Liquor Control Board to adopt sustainable practices.  Unfortunately, they don&apos;t seem willing to ban indoor growing altogether and are weary of cannabis grown in the open sun.  Our group has been featured on CNN and a sunday cover story in the Seattle Times by Bob Young.

Iggy&apos;s is a fermentation house creating raw fermented krauts, beet kvass, herbal honey kombucha, live pickles, probiotic hot sauce &amp; seasonal delicacies.

We source ingredients locally from organic farms &amp; directly from ethical producers we know &amp; trust. We ferment all of our products in small batches using traditional methods–never using pasteurization or preservatives, ensuring that Iggy’s foods are always raw, probiotic, healthful &amp; delicious.

We delight in the double meaning of the word culture, and see the revival of traditional cultured foods as playing a primary role in reclaiming our cultural identity, remedying the modern day homogenization, sterility, and industrialization.  It is our mission to serve local living culture.  As Sandor Katz reminds us, &quot;microorganisms are never found in isolation; they exist in communities.” -- “mixed cultures are the rule of nature.”  It is with this in mind that we say &quot;Alone we rot.  Together we Ferment!&quot;

We are a grass-roots company run by &apos;plant-people&apos; who ferment with reverence in the spirit of the old-world Green Man archetype who is also our logo.  He is the mythological personification of natures&apos; vitality, who enthusiastically proclaims,  &apos;&quot;I am the thought of all plants!&quot;</Field49><Field6>est 2012</Field6><Field25></Field25><Field37>Independent studies at Evergreen provided me and my wife Heather with a wonderful sense of directing ourselves and creating the very structure within which we work.

About my art:
Tamara English’s oil paintings focus on the investigation of the personal sense of the divine. Just as quantum physics describes the movement of phenomena invisible to the eye, mystics of many different traditions describe invisible realms beyond the physical world, such as the subtle and causal realms where our perceptions and beliefs are found, as well as the place where one develops a relationship with the divine of one’s understanding. In exploring these multiple levels of consciousness, English reveals the materialization of spirit, and the spiritualization of matter.

In her work, English is investigating themes related to the literary genre of Magical Realism, which blends magical or unreal elements with rational elements to create a realistic atmosphere that accesses a broader understanding of reality. English also explores the new science called quantum activism, which focuses on transforming ourselves and our world according to the principles of quantum physics. Working with these principles which emphasize consciousness of the individual as a primary element of change, English explores state shift, problem solving, and solution orientations that invite new levels of possibility for creating a better world.</Field49><Field6>Established in 2004</Field6><Field25></Field25><Field37></Field37><DateUpdated></DateUpdated></Entry><Entry><EntryId>725</EntryId><Field380></Field380><Field41>Alex</Field41><Field42>Bryan</Field42><Field34>2012</Field34><Field375>Computer, Technology and Web</Field375><Field378></Field378><Field4>Computer Repair, Data Recovery, IT Consulting</Field4><Field3>Heart Computers</Field3><Field7></Field7><Field9></Field9><Field10></Field10><Field23>alex@heartcomputersoly.com</Field23><Field49>Offering affordable flat-rate computer repair (mac and pc), data recovery, and IT consulting to Olympia and the surrounding areas.</Field49><Field6></Field6><Field25></Field25><Field37></Field37><DateUpdated></DateUpdated></Entry></Entries>
