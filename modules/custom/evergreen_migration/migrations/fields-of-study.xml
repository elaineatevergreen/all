                <p><em><small>Offered Fall 2017&amp;#8211;Spring 2018</small></em></p> The origin
                and evolution of life on Earth, along with chemical and geological changes in the
                Earth itself, have been sources of fascination and controversy. This
                interdisciplinary program examines significant events in the history of life, the
                large-scale geologic changes that have occurred in Earth's history, and the key
                chemical processes involved. This approach will include the cycles and
                transformations of matter and energy, affording an understanding of biological,
                chemical, and physical Earth processes on a variety of scales. The nature of living
                organisms will be examined on molecular, cellular, and physiological levels within
                the context of their evolutionary history. <p>We expect students to end the program
                    with a working knowledge of scientific, mathematical, and computational
                    concepts, ability to reason critically and to solve problems, and with hands-on
                    experience in natural science. Students will also gain a strong appreciation of
                    the interconnectedness of biological and physical systems, and an ability to
                    apply this knowledge to complex problems.</p>

                </p>
                <p>How is college funded, and on whose dime? How much should a state or nation pay
                    for the education of its citizens beyond secondary school, and to what extent
                    should the expense of higher education fall upon individuals and their
                    families?</p>
                <p>In this program, students will explore the financing of higher education as a
                    case study through which they look at larger economic and social
                    issues&amp;#8212;and around which they build applicable skills in finance,
                    economics, business, writing, communication, and research. What is the history
                    of funding for higher education? How do various economic, social, and cultural
                    models impact funding and society? What is the role of economics and finance?
                    What about fundraising, grants, and scholarships? What are the related issues of
                    social justice, equity, access, and political advocacy?</p>
                <p>The program will include lectures, seminars, workshops, films, and guest
                    speakers. Students will participate in collaborative projects and research, and
                    learn from a variety of community leaders.</p>

                <p>Chemistry is fundamental to understanding the world. Everything is made of
                    chemicals, so chemistry touches almost every aspect of our existence. Chemical
                    technologies provide solutions to problems in health care, materials, and energy
                    generation and usage.<br/>
                    <br/> Chemistry is often referred to as the central science because it unites
                    physics and mathematics, biology and medicine, and the earth and environmental sciences.<br/>
                    <br/> At Evergreen you can prepare for a career in science, medicine, or
                    education through the study of chemistry. Discover this branch of science using
                    quantitative methods and analytical tools. You'll study the relationship between
                    molecular structure and function. You'll receive hands-on experience with modern
                    lab techniques and research instrumentation.<br/>
                    <br/> Evergreen students take part in a wide variety of activities: analyzing
                    trace metals in soils, using spectroscopy to determine the structure of

                <p>Though mass media portrays archaeologists as poison-arrow-ducking, Nazi-foiling
                    adventurers, the truth is that archaeologists are scientists&amp;#8212;and they
                    often spend more time in the lab than finding the Ark of the Covenant. This
                    program trains students to be such scientists. Incorporating archaeology,
                    chemistry, math, research, and project presentation (written, oral, and visual),
                    we seek to teach students all stages of the scientific method, from gathering
                    data to presenting original research at conferences.</p>
                <p>The study will benefit students who are looking for general chemistry credits and
                    who have an interest in archaeology. No previous experience in chemistry or
                    archaeology is required, but students should be able to use a scientific
                    calculator and have completed high school algebra. High school precalculus is
                    strongly recommended.</p>

                <p>In this program, students learn the intellectual concepts and skills that are
                    essential for advanced work in computer science and beneficial for computing
                    work in support of other disciplines. Students will have the opportunity to
                    achieve a deeper understanding of increasingly complex computing systems by
                    acquiring knowledge and skills in mathematical abstraction, problem solving, and
                    the organization and analysis of hardware and software systems. The program
                    covers material such as algorithms, data structures, computer organization and
                    architecture, logic, discrete mathematics, and programming in the context of the
                    liberal arts.</p>

                <p>It is a common misconception in environmentalism that if you can educate people
                    about a problem, they will automatically take steps to solve it. In reality,
                    environmental problem solving is much more complex. It requires a good grasp of
                    the ecological system involved, the structure of government, and public
                    policy&amp;#8212;as well as the ability to work effectively in groups.</p>
                <p>This program covers basic ecology, political science, economics, and statistics
                    in order to provide students with the necessary background to understand
                    environmental problems. We will look at ecosystem structure, community ecology,
                    population biology, and some of the ways in which human activities impact
                    ecological systems. In the political science component, students will learn
                    about the structure of government at several levels and the interaction of

                    has caused specific revolutions? What is the relationship between individual

                    which seem inexplicable to us made complete sense to them, and how understanding
                    and interpreting their experiences helps us make sense of our world.

                    awareness to the future.</p>
                <p>You'll prepare for professional work or graduate study by learning how to
                    interpret evidence, create narratives about human experience, and develop sound
                    arguments. You'll learn how historical knowledge is formed by creating it
                    yourself, learning how to do historical research and interpreting what you
                    encounter. You'll learn how to understand secondary sources, research archival

                <p>Human activity shapes the environment. Earth warmed out of the last ice age about
                    10,000 years ago, enabling our species to develop stable societies and transform
                    the experience of being alive. Agricultural activity emitted greenhouse gases
                    that changed Earth&amp;#8217;s air, water, and land. People changed, too,
                    improving technologies and creating written and artistic records of their ideas
                    and histories. Today, we understand our impacts on the environment in ways
                    incomprehensible to our ancestors, and we are challenged to mitigate those
                    impacts with knowledge, skill, and political will.</p>
                <p>This program will examine changes in the Earth system, human understanding of
                    those changes, and the history of technological efforts to enhance human
                    flourishing and shape our impacts on the environment. We'll study multiple
                    drivers of climate change such as Sun-Earth interactions, volcanoes, industry,
                    consumption, and greenhouse gases. We&amp;#8217;ll consider the changing role of
                    science in providing the understanding required for people and planet to thrive
                    together.</p>

                <p>The analytical, research, and writing skills developed in the study of history

<h2>This is Evergreen</h2>
<p>Instead of a pre-defined major, the <a href="/evergreen.edu/advising/academicplanning">academic pathway</a> that you design is unique to your interests and the way that you develop as a person during college. Evergreen <a href="/evergreen.edu/faculty/index">faculty</a> will help you create your pathway one program at a time with the support of faculty.</p>
<p>You&amp;#8217;ll select a <a href="/evergreen.edu/about/programs">program</a>, which typically represents a full-time course load and may last up to three quarters. Students can also participate in courses, <a href="/evergreen.edu/individualstudy/home">individual study</a> or <a href="http://www.evergreen.edu/catalog/2013-14/research">research</a> in subjects of their choosing in coordination with faculty.</p>
<p>Programs may include lectures, labs, readings, seminars, field study, or research projects. The faculty team connects different subject areas around a core theme. Each program is developed with a learning community in mind.</p>
<p>All your classes, teachers and classmates in one place, learning how subjects interact in the real world. Not a collection of isolated courses, taught from dry text. That&amp;#8217;s what Evergreen is about.</p>

                <p>Native American and Indigenous Studies at Evergreen is an interdisciplinary field
                    that examines the histories, cultures, politics, and contemporary experiences of
                    Indigenous peoples in the Northwest and beyond. Founded upon visionary
                    leadership and long-term relationships between Pacific Northwest tribes and
                    Evergreen, programs in Native studies embrace indigenous knowledge as a field of
                    multidisciplinary study. Faculty develop culturally relevant curriculum that
                    strengthens the college's connection to indigenous peoples of the United States,
                    Canada, Aotearoa, and the Pacific Rim. Classes take place both on the Olympia
                    campus and at area tribal centers where Evergreen&amp;#8217;s Reservation-Based
                    Community-Determined programs are offered.</p>

                    U.S./Native history, anthropology, and the tourist industry that motivated many
                    mid-20th and early 21st-century indigenous artists to &amp;#8220;speak
                    truth&amp;#8221; through paintings, sculptures, carvings, basketry, bead work,
                    photography, prints, performance, and multimedia installations as a means of

                    meaning, and contributions of contemporary Native art, not only to indigenous
                    people, but to the non-Native world. Students will develop skills as writers,
                    artists, researchers, and potential allies by studying indigenous scholarship
                    and the artworks of indigenous artists from the 20th and 21st centuries, and by

                <h3>Tribal Reservation-Based Community-Determined Programs</h3>
                <p>For place-bound students who are deeply connected to tribal communities. Classes
                    take place on Indian reservations in western Washington. &amp;#8220;Community
                    determined&amp;#8221; means the program is initiated at the tribes&amp;#8217;
                    request, a tribal advisory board provides curricular direction, and that program
                    content addresses significant community issues and uses community resources.
                    Students attend weekly classes at reservation sites and also attend Saturday
                    classes at the Longhouse, where all students come together for classes,
                    workshops, and cultural events. <a href="http://www.evergreen.edu/tribal/"

                        ethnomusicology, the study of music in cultural context. She plays more than
                        30 musical instruments and has traveled to&amp;#8212;and lived
                        in&amp;#8212;many parts of the world. Her latest book, <em>Bright Star of

                        ethnomusicology award. Her work focuses on the many ways in which music and
                        culture intersect through spirituality, urbanization, food, immigration,

                    <p><strong>Kabby Mitchell III</strong> was born to dance, and he delights in
                        sharing his plethora of experiences from dancing with the Dance Theatre of
                        Harlem, Nederlands Dans Theater, and Pacific Northwest Ballet. His teaching

                        diverse communities globally. He believes that dance is a language that can
                        speak to all involved and he is excited by the infinite possibilities when
                        co-learners find their voices through movement exploration and intellectual

                    <p><strong>Rose Jang</strong> combines her cultural familiarity of Chinese
                        theater with training in Western theater. She is most interested in creating
                        a continuum of understanding and application with her students to
                        incorporate both the Asian sense of control and the Western predilection for
                        creativity and individual freedom in the arts. She enjoys producing
                        innovative shows in classical and experimental formats within multi-quarter
                        programs, starting with serious pursuits of disciplines in both cerebral and

                            Political Economy Alan Nasser in the CCAM studio. Herndon made headlines

                <p>Political economy is an interdisciplinary field combining economics, history,
                    politics, sociology, and philosophy. It asks who has what, who does what kinds
                    of work, how did it get to be that way, and how it could be different. Political
                    science deals with systems of government, and the analysis of political activity
                    and behavior. While there is overlap, political economists focus on economic
                    processes, their relation to power and public policy, and their influence on
                    people's lives and social institutions while political scientists focus on the
                    study of governments and how they work.</p>

                <p>You can analyze the relation between capitalism and race, gender and class
                    inequalities, and how these inequalities can be changed by creating liberatory
                    alternatives to capitalism.&amp;#160;</p>
                <p>You can learn how social change has occurred in the past so you can join with
                    others as more effective agents of change. You can apply your learning through

                <p>This program is the primary gateway to the study of political economy at
                    Evergreen. It introduces students to the building blocks of political-economic
                    analysis: the history and institutions of capitalism, mainstream and alternative
                    economic frameworks, theories of democracy, and theories of social change. We
                    add to this a study of social movements in the past and present, looking at
                    persuasive goals in relation to economic and political conditions, and learning
                    about methods of influencing public attitudes and institutional policies</p>

                <p>This program explores cultural determinants of health for communities and
                    individuals through cross-cultural and mind-body perspectives. How can cultural
                    practices become an integral part of prevention and education in promoting
                    health in culturally respectful ways? How can we engage in transformational
                    conversations about the connections between personal, community, and planetary
                    health? Throughout the program, we will recognize that our individual choices
                    can help us create both personal health and a sustainable environment, a
                    conscious life and a positive presence in society.</p>
                <p>Students will have an opportunity to learn in many ways, using diverse
                    modalities, including working with multiple intelligences and mindfulness
                    practices. We will integrate somatic learning into our studies, including
                    movement, qigong (a Chinese system of physical exercises and breathing control),
                    and expressive arts workshops. Our inquiry will ask us to attune ourselves to
                    the wisdom that is available and present in our mind-body awareness. We will
                    participate in community readings, community service, rigorous writing
                    assignments, and critical study of important texts.</p>

                <p>Psychology studies offer an enormous variety of career paths. The demand for
                    psychological services in schools, hospitals, substance abuse treatment centers,
                    and social services agencies continues to grow. Evergreen students are
                    encouraged to extend their knowledge of psychology to other disciplines. Some go
                    on to pursue graduate study in clinical, developmental, or cognitive psychology,
                    counseling, or social work while others use psychological perspectives to inform
                    their work in literature, the arts, and other fields. If you&amp;#8217;ve ever

                <p>Studying visual and media arts at Evergreen is different than attending an arts
                    school. By setting your study within the context of an interdisciplinary liberal
                    arts education, you will expand your skills in analytical thinking, critical
                    reading, and writing as well as discover themes and ideas that support and
                    refine your artistic practice.</p>
                <p>Our students apply the theoretical and critical concepts they are learning to a
                    range of artistic practices, from solving design problems to the production of
                    full-scale independent projects. You will not just learn to create art
                    &amp;#8212; you will learn to use artistic skills as a means for exploring the
                    vast world of ideas.</p>

                </p>
                <p>This program questions and explores the division between the purpose art has
                    traditionally served and alternative ways art can operate. We will pursue this
                    inquiry through multiple learning modes, including studio practice, contemporary
                    art theory and art history lectures, screenings, readings, written assignments,
                    individual creative projects, and seminars.</p>
                <p>We will ground the program in two studio practices: animation and printmaking.
                    Because both originate in drawing, students will devote significant time to
                    learning drawing skills and theory. Students will work back and forth between
                    drawn and reproduced images, animation and intaglio printmaking, static and
                    moving pictures. They will then develop independent projects that further their
                    own inquiries into these practices. Creating individual and collective projects,
                    students will gain basic studio skills and foundational visual and media
                    literacy. They will learn a range of creative concept development practices,
                    enhancing their knowledge of alternative ways of making and thinking about
                    art.</p>

                <p>Evergreen alumni artists routinely break new ground, creating original works that
                    change the way we look at art&amp;#8212;and the world. From making innovative
                    textiles to reinterpreting traditional carving, photographing rock-n-roll to
                    portraying Antarctica&amp;#8217;s rarely seen environment, Greeners continue to
                    add beauty and insight to the world around them.</p>
                <p>Others make it their business to nurture creative talent and bring it to the
                    larger community. They are graphic designers, documentary film directors,
                    animators and illustrators, fashion designers, photographers, clothiers,
                    jewelers, carvers, and sculptors. Beyond making their careers directly in art,
                    many Evergreen alumni are involved in the arts in other ways, either as artists
                    outside of their jobs or in promotion, arts board leadership, or
                    volunteering.</p>

                    presentation and communication, analytical and critical thinking &amp;#8212;

                <p>What does it mean to write yourself into being?</p>
                <p>This program will investigate the complex relationships between an author, the
                    reader, and her pages: who or what speaks in a literary work? What emerges
                    through a reader&amp;#8217;s work of interpretation&amp;#8212;a new work, a
                    translation? This program&amp;#8217;s goal is to help you become a more skillful
                    and inventive interpreter, a better reader, and ultimately, a more adept writer.
                    We will study and practice various methods of interpretation of literary texts,
                    focusing on works of autobiography, self-portraiture, and self-creation as
                    alter-ego. We will read poetic, dramatic, and narrative works as well as essays.
                    Readings will include, among others, Martinican Aim&amp;#233;
                    C&amp;#233;saire&amp;#8217;s <em>Return to My Native Land</em>;
                        <em>Illuminations</em> by Arthur Rimbaud; Emily Dickinson&amp;#8217;s poems;
                    Jean Genet&amp;#8217;s <em>The Miracle of the Rose</em>; and Ana&amp;#239;s
                    Nin&amp;#8217;s <em>Labyrinths</em>. Students will engage in study of
                    interpretive methodologies, read critical essays in philosophical and
                    psychological approaches to literature, and practice interpretive writing as
                    well as creative exercises in writing themselves into being on the page. The
                    program is preparatory for advanced study of world literature.</p>
