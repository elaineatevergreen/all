       <p><strong>(Olympia, Wash.)</strong> The stories of local Japanese Americans who were
        incarcerated in Idaho concentration camps during World War II are the subject of a talk by
        Tom Ikeda, founder and executive director of Densho: The Japanese American Legacy Project,
        on Thursday, February 27th, at 7:00 p.m. at the Longhouse Cultural Center on the Evergreen
        campus in Olympia. Admission is free and open to the public.</p>
       <p>Ikeda&amp;#8217;s presentation, &amp;#8220;When Citizenship Didn&amp;#8217;t Matter:
        Personal Stories from Japanese Americans Incarcerated during World War II,&amp;#8221; will
        explore issues of democracy, intolerance, wartime hysteria and civil rights, based on
        hundreds of oral histories conducted by Densho over the last 18 years.</p>
       <p>Ikeda was born and raised in Seattle. His parents and grandparents were incarcerated
        during World War II at Minidoka, Idaho. A former manager at Microsoft, Ikeda graduated from
        the University of Washington. He has received numerous awards for his historical
        contributions, including the Humanities Washington Award for outstanding achievement in the
        public humanities, the National JACL Japanese American of the Biennium award for Education,
        and the Microsoft Alumni Fellows Award.</p>
       <p>Ikeda&amp;#8217;s presentation takes place under the banner of the Willi Unsoeld Seminar,
        a speaker series honoring Unsoeld, a founding faculty member of The Evergreen State
        College.</p>
       <p>&amp;#8220;Each year, faculty, staff, and students focus on a theme linked to the
        college&amp;#8217;s core values,&amp;#8221; said Evergreen faculty member Nancy Koppelman.
        &amp;#8220;This year, the theme is 'listening', and why listening is essential to
        education.&amp;#8221;</p>
       <p>Evergreen launched the academic year by assigning NPR Story Corps creator Dave
        Isay&amp;#8217;s book, Listening is an Act of Love, to all students, and he spoke on campus
        in September 2013. Ikeda&amp;#8217;s presentation continues and elaborates on the theme.</p>
       <p>The Willi Unsoeld Seminar honors the philosopher, educator and mountaineer who helped
        Evergreen develop its emphasis on student-directed learning, interdisciplinary programs,
        collaboration and personal responsibility. Unsoeld lost his life in an avalanche during a
        mountaineering expedition with Evergreen students on Mt. Rainier on March 4, 1979.</p>
       <p>The Evergreen State College is located at 2700 Evergreen Parkway in Olympia. Buses #41 and
        #48 from downtown Olympia stop at campus every 15 minutes. Parking is $2.00</p>

        Creates New Position for Tribal Relations</h2>
       <p><strong>(Olympia, Wash.)</strong> With the goal of deepening and expanding relationships
        with tribal governments in the Pacific Northwest, The Evergreen State College has named
        former Makah tribal chairman Micah McCarty to the new post of Special Assistant to the
        President for Tribal Government Relations.</p>
       <p>&amp;#8220;Micah is a noted tribal leader and artist, with great experience in health
        care, cultural survival, treaty resources, sustainable development, and energy
        issues,&amp;#8221; said Evergreen President Thomas L. &amp;#8220;Les&amp;#8221; Purce.
        &amp;#8220;We know his expertise and passion will help us strengthen our relationships with
        Native communities.&amp;#8221;</p>
       <p>McCarty is working with the Washington state-based Tribal Leaders Congress on Indian
        Education to review curricula and educational pathways for Native students, from the Head
        Start program up to the PhD level. McCarty has also established a relationship between local
        tribal governments and the college&amp;#8217;s newly formed Center for Sustainable
        Infrastructure to improve tribal water systems.</p>
       <p>Some 4.5 percent of current Evergreen students are Native American. Evergreen hosts the
        Longhouse Education and Cultural Center, the first Native longhouse built on a public
        college campus in the U.S. The college also offers a master of public administration degree
        with a concentration on tribal governance, a program of study on Native American and world
        indigenous peoples, and sponsors a reservation-based program where classes are offered
        locally and the study topics are determined in partnership with tribal authorities.</p>
       <p>McCarty previously served on the National Ocean Council Governance Coordination Committee
        and former Governor Christine Gregoire&amp;#8217;s blue ribbon panel on ocean acidification.
        He is also focused on what Native communities have to offer Evergreen.</p>
       <p>&amp;#8220;Tribal governments are great educational resources, because of their growing
        diversity in expertise. It only seems logical that we find more ways to work together for
        the advancement of education as a whole,&amp;#8221; said McCarty. &amp;#8220;Long-term
        tribal leadership is based on interdisciplinary experience and creative
        thinking&amp;#8212;both of which are great Evergreen attributes,&amp;#8221; he said.</p>

       <h2>Evergreen Connects Students to Community with Internship Fair</h2>
       <p><strong>(Olympia, Wash.)</strong> The Evergreen State College will deepen and expand its
        engagement with local schools, non-profit organizations and government agencies via the
        Community Opportunities and Internships Fair on January 29th. This event, now in its 22nd
        year, links students and community members with internship and employment opportunities with
        more than 70 local organizations.</p>
       <p>&amp;#8220;This fair is all about connecting students with the community. Internships and
        volunteering are so integrated with the college&amp;#8217;s learning model, and this event
        provides students with those connections,&amp;#8221; said Katherine McGee, program
        coordinator of academic advising. &amp;#8220;The community gives to students in so many
        ways; volunteering is a great way for students to give back to the community. Many of the
        organizations that come to the fair are small operations that would struggle without student
        interns.&amp;#8221;</p>
       <p>The Community Opportunities and Internships Fair is a part of the longstanding role
        volunteering and internships play in the Evergreen curriculum, with many classes and
        programs requiring community service. Many organizations, such as Thurston Community
        Television, return every year to scout new student talent, which TCTV needs in order to
        produce programs for the community. Evergreen students contribute more than 12,000 hours a
        year to Thurston County organizations, according to an Evergreen economic impact assessment
        conducted in 2013.</p>
       <p>Some of the organizations that will be at the fair include SafePlace, Hands On
        Children&amp;#8217;s Museum, Peace Corps, Garfield Elementary, Olympic National Park, and
        GRuB.</p>
       <p>The fair is hosted by the academic advising office in partnership with the Center for
        Community Based Learning and Action and the student employment office. The event takes place
        on January 29th from 12 noon to 3 p.m. in the lobby of the library building at The Evergreen
        State College, located at 2700 Evergreen Parkway NW in Olympia.</p>

       <p><strong>(Olympia, Wash.)</strong> The Evergreen State College Gallery kicks off the new
        year with Selected Druckworks, a multi-media survey of the work of Johanna Drucker, renowned
        artist, writer, typographic poet, scholar, and critic. Drucker&amp;#8217;s work has been
        displayed at the National Museum of Women in the Arts, Columbia University, and the Art
        Institute of Chicago.</p>
       <p>This exhibit focuses on book art, a field which Drucker pioneers, showcasing typographic,
        literary, and visual art through a series of intricate, hand-made books. Drucker&amp;#8217;s
        sketches and watercolors beautifully articulate the female form, and line the walls of the
        space. Screens will also display the artist&amp;#8217;s early slide show work, along with
        Drucker&amp;#8217;s talk from the Fall Gallery Artist Lecture Series. The work spans
        Drucker&amp;#8217;s long career, ranging from the early 1970&amp;#8217;s to today.</p>
       <p>&amp;#8220;The wide variety of mediums provide so many layers for people to
        explore,&amp;#8221; said Anne Friedman, Gallery Director and Curator. &amp;#8220;There are
        also many interesting themes, such as femininity, gender identity and the body, politics, at
        play in this excellent, varied work.&amp;#8221;</p>
       <p>The exhibit opens Monday, January 13, 2014, at The Evergreen State College, on the ground
        floor of the library building, 2700 Evergreen Parkway, in Olympia. The exhibition continues
        through February 28 and is open to the public. For more details, go to <a
         href="http://www.evergreen.edu/gallery/">http://www.evergreen.edu/gallery/</a>, or call the
        gallery at 360-867-5125.</p>

       <p><strong>(Olympia, Wash.)</strong>The Evergreen State College, Tacoma is offering a one-day
        entry-level workshop on grant and proposal writing, taught by municipal leader and educator
        Elton Gatewood, on Friday, February 28.</p>

       <p><strong>(Olympia, Wash.)</strong> Washington state high school seniors now have a valuable
        new reason to think about liberal arts: several thousand dollars in scholarships.</p>
       <p>A group of top Washington state public and private colleges and universities, the
        Washington Consortium for the Liberal Arts, has just announced a scholarship essay contest
        for Washington state high school seniors enrolled during the 2013-14 academic year. The
        first prize winner will receive a $3,000 scholarship to a Washington Consortium for the
        Liberal Arts (WaCLA) school, the second prize is a $2,000 scholarship, and third prize
        offers $1,000.</p>
       <p>&amp;#8220;We want to help focus attention on the power and value of the liberal
        arts,&amp;#8221; said Michael Zimmerman, vice-president for academic affairs at The
        Evergreen State College. &amp;#8220;A solid grounding in liberal arts is a foundation for
        career success, whether in science, business, technology or other areas. It&amp;#8217;s also
        essential to a strong democracy.&amp;#8221;</p>
       <p>Schools in the consortium include the University of Washington, The Evergreen State
        College, Washington State University, Whitman College, South Puget Sound Community College,
        Eastern Washington University and several others throughout the state.</p>
       <p>The essay contest asks participants to discuss the relationship between the liberal arts
        and democratic principles, in no more than 500 words. More information and submission
        details can be found at https://collab.evergreen.edu/hsessay . The deadline for submissions
        is Friday, January 31, 2014 at 5:00 p.m. PST. Contest winners will be announced in
        mid-March.</p>

       <p><strong>(Olympia, Wash.)</strong> According to infrastructure experts, the U.S. will need
        to spend some $3.6 trillion by 2020 on our nation&amp;#8217;s energy, transportation water
        and waste systems. Will we spend that money wisely, investing in creative new approaches and
        sustainable innovation which will be better for the environment and cheaper for
        tax-payers?</p>
       <p>With the goal of creating innovative solutions to these massive public works challenges,
        The Evergreen State College has created the new Center for Sustainable Infrastructure. Based
        at the college&amp;#8217;s Olympia campus, the center will link regional innovators,
        advocate sustainable best practices and develop skilled professionals who will put these
        principles into infrastructure development.</p>
       <p>&amp;#8220;Just to keep our economy working is going to require that we invest hundreds of
        billions of dollars on infrastructure along the Pacific Coast in the next few
        decades,&amp;#8221; said Rhys Roth, the center&amp;#8217;s director.</p>
       <p>&amp;#8220;There is an urgent need to bring world-class innovation, new tools, and
        sustainability excellence to our infrastructure planning and investment. The Northwest can
        be a national and global leader in sustainable infrastructure, and the center will help to
        make that happen,&amp;#8221; Roth said.</p>
       <p>The Pacific Northwest-based Bullitt Foundation, which supports sustainable development in
        the region, announced a $20,000 grant last week to help the initial launch of the
        center.</p>
       <p>In addition to being a clearinghouse for best sustainable practices and an advising center
        for agencies, utilities and tribes managing infrastructure, the center will give graduate
        students from the college&amp;#8217;s Master of Public Administration program opportunities
        to research, analyze and design infrastructure project proposals.</p>
       <p>&amp;#8220;At a time when huge investments in infrastructure are critical and when we need
        to find ways to moderate our environmental footprint, the work of the center is of
        particular importance,&amp;#8221; said Evergreen Provost and Vice-President for Academic
        Affairs Michael Zimmerman. &amp;#8220;The opportunity it will provide for students to become
        involved in such groundbreaking research is truly exciting.&amp;#8221;</p>

       </div> Still Time to Enroll in Evergreen&amp;#8217;s Grays Harbor College Program
        <p>(Olympia, Wash.) Harbor residents can enroll in a unique college program taught by
        top-level faculty from The Evergreen State College at Grays Harbor College this winter.</p>
       <p>Community health expert Nancy Anderson and historian Frances Rains will lead
        &amp;#8220;Health Inequality: Telling the Story and Changing It.&amp;#8221; This program
        focuses on the region&amp;#8217;s European settlement and Native people, examining how
        health, wellbeing and sustainability can be improved for all people of the Salish Sea.
        Successful completion of the winter and spring quarters of the program is worth 16
        credits.</p>
       <p>&amp;#8220;Even though this is a three-quarter program, it&amp;#8217;s certainly okay to
        take one or two quarters and still get a lot from the class,&amp;#8221; said
        Evergreen&amp;#8217;s dean for evening and weekend studies, Sarah Ryan. &amp;#8220;Students
        who are new to Evergreen can register in person at the Olympia campus starting December
        16.&amp;#8221;</p>
       <p>Started in 2000, Evergreen&amp;#8217;s Grays Harbor program was designed to give local
        community college graduates the opportunity to earn a bachelor&amp;#8217;s degree without
        having to leave the area. Classes take place on weekends and are taught by Evergreen faculty
        on the Grays Harbor College campus.</p>
       <p>The focus of the program changes from year to year but centers on interdisciplinary
        management, leadership, and the health of individuals, communities, and organizations.
        Students benefit from meaningful instruction as they develop critical thinking and
        analytical skills, refine problem-solving techniques, and become effective team players.</p>
       <p>The program has been the springboard for some notable published work by Harbor students.
        &amp;#8220;Telling Our Stories: Voices of Grays Harbor,&amp;#8221; is an anthology of
        original essays, oral histories and poetry by local residents, who took the
        &amp;#8220;&amp;#8220;Telling Our Stories&amp;#8221; 2011-12 program, which focused on local
        history, creative writing and community studies.</p>

       <h2>A Totem Pole History&amp;#8221; Celebrates Coast Salish Art and Influence at
        Evergreen</h2>
       <p><strong>(Olympia, Wash.)</strong> One of the Pacific Northwest&amp;#8217;s leading Native
        artists, from a family long associated with Evergreen, is the subject of a richly
        illustrated new book, <em>A Totem Pole History: the Work of Lummi Carver Joe Hillaire</em>.
        The inaugural release of the book will be hosted by members of &amp;#8220;Creativity and
        Diversity in American Culture: Art and Narrative in Response to Place,&amp;#8221; December 3
        at the College.</p>
       <p>Lummi elder Pauline Hillaire writes about her father&amp;#8217;s legacy as one of the most
        influential Coast Salish artists of the twentieth century. The book includes photographs of
        Joe Hillaire&amp;#8217;s most significant totem poles, along with essays from contributors
        on Coast Salish art history, pigment technology, oral history, intercultural relations and
        the central role of art in Coast Salish life.</p>
       <p>Joe Hillaire&amp;#8217;s daughter, Mary Ellen Hillaire, was a founding faculty member of
        Evergreen who spearheaded the development of the College&amp;#8217;s Native American studies
        programs in 1972. She also inspired the creation of Evergreen's &amp;#8220;House of
        Welcome&amp;#8221; Longhouse Education and Cultural Center, the first building of its kind
        on any college campus in the U.S.</p>
       <p>&amp;#8220;The Hillaire family has played a special role in the development of Native
        arts, culture, and education on our campus,&amp;#8221; said Evergreen faculty member Rebecca
        Chamberlain. &amp;#8220;This is a wonderful occasion to let people know about this
        history.&amp;#8221;</p>
       <p>Lummi/Haida carver Felix Solomon, editor Gregory Fields, and others associated with the
        publication will present images and readings from the book and its accompanying video and
        audio CDs at the December 3 event, which will take place at 3 p.m. in Seminar Building Two,
        Room C1105 at The Evergreen State College, 2700 Evergreen Parkway NW in Olympia. Copies of
        the book will be available for purchase. Additional background on author Pauline Hillaire

       <p><strong>(Olympia, Wash.)</strong> Can doing math together actually be fun? Students from
        interested high schools can find out at the 5th Annual High School Math Meet on November 23
        at The Evergreen State College.</p>
       <p>"Our meet is a great opportunity to have fun doing math with your peers - and it looks
        great on college applications, too,&amp;#8221; says Brian Walter, faculty member and event
        organizer. &amp;#8220;It&amp;#8217;s also an opportunity for local students to learn about
        the amazing math and science programs at Evergreen.&amp;#8221;</p>
       <p>The goal of this math meet is to provide an inclusive and encouraging space for
        Olympia-area students to test their mathematic skills. This free tournament will offer four
        events, including a collaborative team test and a three-person relay test. Two individual
        competitions will also take place; one with calculators and one without.</p>
       <p>All participants will receive a certificate of participation. Those who score greater than
        50 percent in any event will be invited to the Washington Regional Math Championship to be
        held at Evergreen in April 2014.</p>
       <p>The tournament takes place on Saturday, November 23 from 9 am-4 pm. Schools are encouraged
        to register early, because space is limited. More information, including preregistration can
        be found at <a href="http://blogs.evergreen.edu/mathtourney/"
         >blogs.evergreen.edu/mathtourney/</a>.</p>

       <p>Student writing is the focus of a brand new media outlet, The Evergreen State College
        Press, which celebrates its launch on November 13.</p>
       <p>Student authors will read from their essays, which highlight the diversity of experience
        among the student population, ranging from school support for autistic youth to the lives of
        West Coast wild mushroom pickers. These essays and more make up the press&amp;#8217;s first
        release, Writing American Cultures: Studies of Identity, Community, and Peace.</p>
       <p>&amp;#8220;This book is a tool for active citizenship,&amp;#8221; said faculty member and
        editor Sam Schrager. &amp;#8220;It attunes us to other&amp;#8217;s lives.&amp;#8221;</p>
       <p>The goal of the press is to be a long-term medium for the publication of student writing,
        highlighting the depth and breadth of written academic and narrative work at the college.
        Faculty will continually collaborate with the press&amp;#8217;s editorial board to generate
        creative, scholarly projects to showcase student writing.</p>
       <p>&amp;#8220;Each year, the press will seek to publish a small number of volumes to make
        visible the vitality and innovation of student work at Evergreen,&amp;#8221; said Provost
        Michael Zimmerman, who also serves as the college&amp;#8217;s vice president of academic
        affairs. The launch readings and reception will take place from 3:00 to 4:30 p.m. at the
        Library Underground at The Evergreen State College. The event will also be live streamed at
         <a href="http://www.evergreen.edu/streams/">evergreen.edu/streams/</a> .</p>

       <h3>Evergreen Welcomes Student Vets to Military-Friendly Campus</h3>
       <p>(Olympia, Wash.) A new Veterans Resource Center, headed by an experienced new director,
        will welcome potential and current veteran students at an open house November 13th at The
        Evergreen State College&amp;#8217;s Olympia campus.</p>
       <p>&amp;#8220;The new Veterans Resource Center is a one-stop shop for vets, where they can
        get advice about education and other benefits, and get help with academic, financial,
        medical or personal issues,&amp;#8221; said center director Randy Kelley.</p>
       <p>Kelley, a retired Navy commander with years of experience working with veterans around the
        U.S., sees Evergreen as a strong fit for returning military eager to make use of their
        earned benefits.</p>
       <p>Evergreen programs are ideal for military, dependents and veterans because they are
        tailored to each individual&amp;#8217;s prior schooling, training and experience,&amp;#8221;
        said Kelley. &amp;#8220;Evergreen is about success and is dedicated to making sure that each
        person who joins the Evergreen family succeeds. And there is one thing that Evergreen does
        better than any school I have seen and that is they truly teach critical
        thinking.&amp;#8221;</p>
       <p>The new center, located on the first floor of the Evergreen library, caps a five-year
        effort by the college to increase resources available to active duty, reserve, dependents
        and veteran students. The Veterans of Evergreen Transition and Support Committee, consisting
        of faculty, staff and veterans, was appointed in 2007 to provide and maintain robust support
        for vets on campus. These efforts have earned Evergreen status as a &amp;#8220;Certified
        Military Friendly School&amp;#8221; by G.I. Jobs, a magazine and website operated by
        veterans that links employers and educators to active duty military, dependents and
        veterans.</p>
       <p>The open house runs from 11 to 3 p.m. on November 13. For additional information on
        Evergreen, military education and other benefits for veterans, contact the Veterans Resource
        Center at 360-867-6254, email: <a

       <p>OLYMPIA, Wash.--KAOS 89.3 FM Olympia Community Radio kicks off its Fall Membership Drive
        on Thursday, November 7. The week-long drive will end Thursday, November 14.</p>
       <p>Membership funds support the programming and training activities of KAOS Olympia Community
        Radio. Celebrating 40 years of community service and nationally recognized programming, KAOS
        is the South Sound&amp;#8217;s only full-time, full-power commercial-free public radio
        service, offering a wide range of independent music, local and global news, and community
        information since 1973. The station streams its broadcasting live online at
        www.kaosradio.org, and can be heard in Thurston County on Comcast Digital Cable channel
        982.</p>
       <p>&amp;#8220;Even after 40 years serving the community, fundraising is always challenging -
        and the current economy doesn&amp;#8217;t help&amp;#8221; says John Ford, KAOS development
        director. &amp;#8220;Yet no matter the economic situation, KAOS has been there, always
        available; with consistent public service programming and entertainment from the community,
        for the community. I firmly believe that our community will rise to the occasion as they
        value the independent resource that is KAOS- Olympia&amp;#8217;s Community
        Radio.&amp;#8221;</p>
       <p>One of Thurston County&amp;#8217;s largest volunteer-based organizations, KAOS is
        programmed by a staff of nearly 100 student and community volunteers. Located at The
        Evergreen State College and supported in part by student funding, the station relies on
        additional funds from community supporters to sustain its operations, programming and public
        service.</p>
       <p>During the drive, KAOS listeners can call in their support to the station&amp;#8217;s main
        studio line at (360) 867-5267 (867-KAOS), or they can join securely online by visiting the
        KAOS Web site at <a href="http://www.kaosradio.org">www.kaosradio.org</a>. Contributions can
        also be mailed to: KAOS, CAB 102, 2700 Evergreen Pkwy NW, Olympia, WA 98505.</p>

        Epic Climb Featured at Unsoeld Seminar</h2>
       <p>(Olympia, Wash.) A film and discussion about the greatest Himalayan climb in American
        mountaineering history will be the feature of this year&amp;#8217;s Unsoeld Seminar November
        20 at 7 p.m. at the Washington Center for the Performing Arts in Olympia.</p>
       <p>&amp;#8220;High and Hallowed: Everest 1963&amp;#8221; tells the story of Willi Unsoeld and
        Tom Hornbein&amp;#8217;s pioneering ascent of the West Ridge of Mt. Everest, and examines
        the risk and adventure that drew them to the summit. Filmmakers David Morton, Jake Norton
        and Jim Aikman will join Tom Hornbein onstage after the film to discuss the film with the
        audience. This event is free.</p>
       <p>Willi Unsoeld was a philosopher, mountaineer and founding faculty member at The Evergreen
        State College who lost his life in an avalanche on Mt. Rainier in 1979.</p>
       <p>The Unsoeld Seminar series is endowed as a living memorial to Unsoeld&amp;#8217;s
        interests in wilderness and human values, ethics and human behavior, effective learning and
        experiential education, philosophy and environmental awareness, nature and culture. Since
        1986, the series has offered lectures, workshops and performances that engage and involve
        participants, and reflect Evergreen&amp;#8217;s emphasis on collaboration and personal
        responsibility.</p>

        survey this week in a session on local retail planning at the meeting of the Washington
        State chapter of the American Planning Association October 2-3 in Bellevue.</p>
       <p>Gerend believes the Evergreen data will help planners guide retail development more
        efficiently and perhaps begin a regional dialogue around planning for retail.</p>
       <p>&amp;#8220;A surprising finding from this data was that, in most of our surveyed
        municipalities, downtowns were not the main areas for sales tax revenues and
        shopping,&amp;#8221; said Gerend. &amp;#8221;Respondents overwhelmingly noted
        downtowns&amp;#8217; importance in other ways, such as for tourism and the community
        identity.&amp;#8221;</p>
       <p>According to Gerend, much of the scholarly research on U.S. downtowns and retail planning
        has been in the form of case studies. There are also many how-to guides for practitioners.
        The Evergreen data quantifies municipal policies, staff activities, and the functionality of
        different retail areas today, in a way that case studies do not.</p>
       <p>Further analysis on the complete scope of topics from the survey will be ongoing
        throughout the year, with scholarly publications to follow. In addition to Gerend, the
        scientific study team included Evergreen student Shira Moch (with funding from
        Evergreen&amp;#8217;s new Summer Undergraduate Research Program), Evergreen faculty member
        Ralph Murphy and Mathew Novak from Central Washington University.</p>

       <p>(Olympia, Wash.) At The Evergreen State College, orientation week means moving into dorms,
        getting the layout of the campus figured out, and giving to the local community, all before
        the official start of classes September 30.</p>
       <p>This Friday, September 27, more than 150 Evergreen students will fan out to the Lincoln
        Elementary school garden, the Deschutes River Stream Team, the Thurston County Food Bank and
        other sites to clean, paint, harvest, pull blackberry brambles and contribute their sweat
        equity to their Olympia home. They will be dressed for all weather, in clothes that are
        ready to get dirty, to meet the needs of the larger community.</p>
       <p>&amp;#8220;Evergreen&amp;#8217;s participation in the United Way &amp;#8220;Day of
        Caring&amp;#8221; is the first contact many new students have with the community,&amp;#8221;
        said Ellen Shortt-Sanchez, director of Evergreen&amp;#8217;s Center for Community Based
        Learning and Action. &amp;#8220;Many students will then go on to intern with local
        non-profit groups, which gives them a chance to learn in the field.&amp;#8221;</p>
       <p>Evergreen students contribute about 12,000 hours of volunteer work annually throughout
        Thurston County. This will be the fourth year of Evergreen participation in the
        &amp;#8220;Day of Caring,&amp;#8221; where students will work alongside employees of state
        agencies, local service organizations, tribal members and church groups at some eleven sites
        throughout the county.</p>

        behind-the-scenes view of a massive textile work first glimpsed at the Smithsonian
        Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum in New York.</p>
       <p>&amp;#8220;Palace Yurt: Deconstructed,&amp;#8221; explores the work of Evergreen alumna
        Janice Arnold, whose gorgeous, handmade felt tents and banners were the centerpiece of the
        Cooper-Hewitt&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8220;Fashioning Felt&amp;#8221; exhibit in 2009.</p>
       <p>In this exhibit, Arnold combines pieces from the original installation, which is a
        contemporary translation of traditional Mongolian structures, with her drawings and details
        on materials and logistics. It offers visitors a rare look behind the scenes, from
        inspiration to full artistic vision, about how this groundbreaking work came together.</p>
       <p>The exhibit opens <strong>Thursday, October 10, from 5:00 to 7:00 p.m.</strong> at The
        Evergreen State College, on the ground floor of the library building, 2700 Evergreen
        Parkway, in Olympia. The exhibition continues through December 11. Artist Janice Arnold will
        lecture on the work on Wednesday, November 20, 11:30 to 1:00 p.m. at Lecture Hall 1 on the
        Evergreen Olympia campus. The exhibit and lecture are open to the public.vFor more details,

       <h2>Best of the West: Evergreen Fourth on 2014 U.S. News &amp; World Report Top Public
        Universities List</h2>
       <p>(Olympia, Wash.) Considered among &amp;#8220;America&amp;#8217;s Best Colleges&amp;#8221;
        for 2014, this year&amp;#8217;s annual U.S. News &amp; World Report rankings have pushed The
        Evergreen State College up a rung to fourth place among best public regional universities in
        the West, second in top regional schools for undergraduate teaching and 27th overall among
        private and public universities in the West.</p>
       <p>Evergreen also won top marks for offering outstanding first-year experiences for freshmen
        and for building &amp;#8220;learning communities&amp;#8221; that help students get to know
        one another and their faculty well.</p>
       <p>The rankings are based on graduation and retention rates, peer assessment, faculty
        resources, student selectivity, financial resources, graduation rate performance and alumni
        giving. This year, U.S. News increased the weight of graduation and retention rates. As a
        result, outcome-related measures account for 30 percent of the rankings and are now the most
        heavily weighted factors.</p>
       <p>"U.S. News strives to provide students and their families with the most comprehensive data
        available," said Bob Morse, director of data research. "Measuring outcomes is critical to
        understanding how well a school retains and educates its students."</p>
       <p>The U.S. News rankings are the most widely read and influential in the United States.</p>
       <p>&amp;#8220;While no single college ranking can capture the full picture of a college or
        university,&amp;#8221; explained Evergreen spokesperson Sandra Kaiser, &amp;#8220;reviews
        such as U.S. News, Fiske Guide, Princeton Review, Military Friendly Schools and others can
        provide useful information for prospective students and their parents. We&amp;#8217;re
        pleased that we have once again been noted as one of America&amp;#8217;s best colleges in
        all of these rankings this year.&amp;#8221;</p>
       <p>The Evergreen State College is a public liberal arts and sciences college known for
        academic excellence, value and a distinctive interdisciplinary, student-centered approach to
        education.</p>

        Successfully concluding a search process that drew applicants from across the nation, The
        Evergreen State College recently named Wendy Endress, Ph.D., as its new vice president for
        student affairs.</p>
       <p>Endress has more than 20 years of experience in student affairs at both public and private
        institutions. At Evergreen since 2007, Endress served as the executive associate to the vice
        president for student affairs as well as interim director of recreation and athletics. Prior
        to Evergreen, Endress was at Portland State University as dean of students and associate
        vice provost for student affairs. She holds a doctorate in college student personnel from
        the University of Maryland, as well as a Master of Arts from Bowling Green State University,
        and a Bachelor of Arts from Union College.</p>
       <p>&amp;#8220;Wendy brings a deep commitment to student access and success in higher
        education as well as depth and breadth in leading student affairs,&amp;#8221; said Evergreen
        President Thomas L. &amp;#8220;Les&amp;#8221; Purce.</p>
       <p>Endress succeeds Art Costantino, who held the position from 1992 until his retirement this
        summer. The vice president for student affairs, one of four vice president positions at
        Evergreen, oversees enrollment, student and academic support services, residential and
        dining services, recreation and athletics, and police services.</p>
       <p>The Evergreen State College is a nationally acclaimed public liberal arts and sciences
        college known for its distinctive interdisciplinary, student-centered approach to
        academics.</p>

       <p>(Olympia, Wash.) &amp;#8211; Today <em>Sierra</em> magazine released its seventh annual
        ranking of the nation&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8220;Coolest Schools,&amp;#8221; a salute to U.S.
        colleges and universities that are helping to solve climate problems and making significant
        efforts to operate sustainably. The Evergreen State College ranks 17th out of 162 higher
        education institutions across the country included in the rankings. There are approximately
        2500 four-year colleges and universities in the United States.</p>
       <p>&amp;#8220;Evergreen functions as a laboratory for sustainability, through our operations,
        curriculum, and quality of life for employees and students,&amp;#8221; said Scott Morgan,
        director of sustainability at Evergreen. &amp;#8220;We want to nurture values and practical
        skills that contribute to a sustainable way of living on a healthy planet. This high ranking
        reflects the work we&amp;#8217;ve put into achieving our goals."</p>
       <p><em>Sierra</em> examined the academic institutions making a difference for the planet,
        seeking out campuses that are creating tangible change in all categories of greenness
        &amp;#8211; from what&amp;#8217;s served in dining halls to what&amp;#8217;s taught in
        lecture halls to what&amp;#8217;s powering the dorms. The magazine's ranking aims to act as
        a guide for prospective students who seek a way to compare colleges based on their
        commitment to environmentalism. It also serves to spur competition, create aspirational
        standards, and publicly reward the institutions that work hard to protect the planet</p>
       <p>&amp;#8220;For the past seven years, <em>Sierra</em> magazine has ranked colleges and
        universities on their commitment to fighting climate disruption and making sure the future
        their students will inhabit has safe water, clean air and beautiful landscapes,&amp;#8221;
        said Bob Sipchen, <em>Sierra</em> magazine&amp;#8217;s editor-in-chief. &amp;#8220;By
        showing such strong leadership on so many fronts -- from energy use and transportation to
        the courses they offer -- the best of these schools are pointing the way for other
        institutions.&amp;#8221;</p>
       <p>The complete rankings, along with this year&amp;#8217;s coverage of higher
        education&amp;#8217;s environmental efforts, are online at <a

      <body><p>(Olympia, Wash.) The Evergreen State College is one of the nation's best institutions
        for undergraduate education, according to The Princeton Review&amp;#8217;s new 2014 edition
        of its annual college guide, "The Best 378 Colleges." Only about 15 percent of
        America&amp;#8217;s 2,500 four-year colleges are profiled in the book, one of the
        nation&amp;#8217;s leading college guides. Evergreen, Washington State University and the
        University of Washington are the only public baccalaureate institutions in the state to make
        the list.</p>
       <p>"Evergreen offers outstanding academics, which is the primary criteria for our choice of
        schools for the book,&amp;#8221; said Robert Franek, author of the 2014 guide. &amp;#8220;We
        base our selections primarily on data we obtain in our annual institutional data surveys. We
        also take into account input we get from our staff, our 35-member National College Counselor
        Advisory Board, our personal visits to schools, and the wide range of feedback we get from
        our surveys of students attending these schools.&amp;#8221;</p>
       <p>&amp;#8220;Evergreen represents an extraordinary combination of quality and
        value,&amp;#8221; said college president Les Purce. &amp;#8220;We&amp;#8217;re proud to be
        recognized for what we can offer to our students and our state.&amp;#8221;</p>
       <p>Tuition costs for 2014 are estimated to be $12,397 at UW, $11,396 at WSU and $8,521 at
        Evergreen.</p>
       <p>In its profile of Evergreen, The Princeton Review praises the college for its
        &amp;#8220;unique approach&amp;#8221; to academics and quotes extensively from Evergreen
        students surveyed for the book. &amp;#8220;Even the science programs involve large portions
        of discussion and peer collaboration,&amp;#8221; said a student, praising the interaction
        between professors and students. &amp;#8220;Students at Evergreen are commonly some of the
        strongest performers in their high schools,&amp;#8221; notes the guide. &amp;#8220;The
        college&amp;#8217;s self-directed academic curriculum favors students who can handle the
        responsibility of creating and developing their own educational path.&amp;#8221;</p> The
       guide highlights the excellent quality of student life at Evergreen, with the
       &amp;#8220;kindness and awareness of the community&amp;#8221; frequently cited by students to
       be one of the most valued aspects of their experience. The professionalism of campus housing
       staff and campus police also come in for praise. <p>Rankings are based on publicly available
        data related to academics, admissions selectivity, financial aid and other factors as well
        as a survey of 126,000 students nationally; an average of 333 per school. See <a
         href="http://www.princetonreview.com/college-rankings.aspx">the Princeton Review
         website</a> for more information.</p>

       <p>Low-income Evergreen students studying sustainability, nature conservation or business
        will soon get some extra help from high-level sources. A $500,000 pledge from the Dan and
        Sheryl Tishman Family Foundation, along with a matching grant from the Bill &amp; Melinda
        Gates Foundation, will be used by The Evergreen State College Foundation to create a new $1
        million scholarship fund. The fund will support up to 25 students annually.</p>
       <p>Dan Tishman, who graduated from Evergreen in 1977, is chairman and CEO of Tishman
        Construction, one of New York City&amp;#8217;s top building companies. Responsible for
        rebuilding the World Trade Center complex after the attacks of 9/11, Tishman Construction is
        also noted for environmentally friendly buildings throughout the city. Tishman is also
        chairman of the Board of the Natural Resources Defense Council, one of the world's leading
        environmental advocacy organizations.&amp;#160;</p>
       <p>&amp;#8220;Sheryl and I are so pleased that this pledge will create opportunities for
        Evergreen students for years to come. We are true believers in the value of education and
        hope that this scholarship program will make a difference in many, many lives,&amp;#8221;
        said Tishman.</p>
       <p>&amp;#8220;I am especially proud to make this investment to support students at my alma
        mater, Evergreen, a college that allowed me to explore my passion for sustainability and
        nature conservation, which ultimately developed into a lifelong commitment,&amp;#8221; he
        said.&amp;#160;&amp;#160;</p>
       <p>Les Purce, president of The Evergreen State College, sees the Tishman and Gates Foundation
        gifts as directly supporting Evergreen&amp;#8217;s commitment to college access.
        &amp;#8220;The investment by the Tishman Family Foundation, along with the matching Gates
        Foundation grant, will support students from the widest range of backgrounds in completing
        their degrees today, tomorrow and long into the future.&amp;#8221;</p>

       <h3>Improving Health and Success of Young Men of Color</h3>
       <p>Princeton, NJ, - The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF) today announced its support of
        The Evergreen State College &amp;#8220;Gateways for Incarcerated Youth&amp;#8221; program
        through Forward Promise, the Foundation&amp;#8217;s $9.5 million initiative to improve the
        health and success of boys and young men of color. Gateways will receive approximately
        $500,000 over 30 months to support its programs that bring college students to juvenile
        institutions to work as peer mentors, tutors, and co-learners with incarcerated youth.</p>
       <p>Gateways for Incarcerated Youth, based at Evergreen&amp;#8217;s Center for Community Based
        Learning and Action, was one of 10 organizations selected for their innovative
        community-based programs that strengthen health, education, and employment outcomes for
        middle school- and high school-aged boys and young men of color.</p>
       <p>&amp;#8220;Young men of color are the future of our communities. Gateways works to support
        college access for incarcerated youth and provide peer learning for campus-based student
        mentors in a community setting,&amp;#8221; said Evergreen faculty member Chico Herbison.</p>
       <p>&amp;#8220;We are excited to be part of the community of Forward Promise
        grantees,&amp;#8221; said grant project director Ellen Shortt Sanchez. &amp;#8220;This
        community is developing innovative models across the country that can put all of our young
        people on a path to a healthy and successful adulthood.&amp;#8221;</p>
       <p>RWJF launched Forward Promise in 2012 to address the fact that boys and young men of color
        are more likely to grow up in poverty, live in unsafe neighborhoods, and attend schools that
        lack the basic resources and supports that kids need in order to thrive. In addition,
        actions that might be treated as youthful indiscretions by other young men often are judged
        more severely and result in harsher punishments that have lasting consequences.</p>
       <p>Statistics reflect these troubling trends: 44 percent of Latino males and 46 percent of
        African American males do not have a high school diploma, and Latino youth are two times
        more likely and African-American youth are five times more likely to be involved with the
        juvenile justice system than their white counterparts.</p>
       <p>&amp;#8220;So much of our health is shaped by forces beyond the doctor&amp;#8217;s office
        that are rooted in where we live, learn, work, and play. Far too many boys and young men of
        color become disconnected from school and work opportunities, undermining their ability to
        live healthy lives and strengthen their communities,&amp;#8221; said Maisha Simmons, RWJF
        program officer. &amp;#8220;This innovative model is helping young men overcome significant
        challenges, and we look forward to working with Gateways for Incarcerated Youth at The
        Evergreen State College to create a new future of hope for America&amp;#8217;s young men of
        color.&amp;#8221;</p>
       <p>RWJF is investing in best practices and successful models around the nation that can be
        strengthened and spread to help even more boys and young men of color. Gateways, together
        with the other grantees supported through RWJF&amp;#8217;s Forward Promise initiative, seeks
        to improve outcomes for African-American, Latino, Asian-Pacific Islander, and/or Native
        American boys and young men in one or more of the following areas: 1) school discipline
        approaches that do not push students out of school; 2) early interventions that focus on
        dropout prevention and increasing middle school retention and high school graduation rates;
        3) mental health solutions tailored to young men who have been exposed to violence and
        trauma; and 4) career-training programs that address both education and employment to ensure
        that youth are college- and career-ready.</p>
       <p>Gateways offers incarcerated youth the chance to earn college credit while participating
        in faculty-led Evergreen seminar classes held at the juvenile institution and enlists
        college students as peer mentors and co-learners in academic work. In partnership with
        Washington state&amp;#8217;s Green Hill School and Juvenile Rehabilitation Administration,
        this grant will provide more youth with educational access and support.</p>

       <p>(Olympia, Wash.) High-quality academics and low costs have earned The Evergreen State
        College a &amp;#8220;Best Buy&amp;#8221; rating in the Fiske Guide to Colleges 2014,
        released July 2. Evergreen is the only Washington school to earn a place among the 21 public
        colleges and universities on this list for 2014, which includes top choices from the U.S.,
        Canada and the United Kingdom.</p>
       <p>The &amp;#8220;Best Buy&amp;#8221; rating signifies top-flight academics and inexpensive
        or moderate costs, according to Fiske. The latest edition represents the 30th anniversary of
        the guide, created by former New York Times education editor Edward B. Fiske.</p>
       <p>The Fiske guide noted that Evergreen programs in environmental science, media, physical
        and biological sciences, social sciences, computer science and humanities are particularly
        strong.</p>
       <p>In addition, the guide notes that freshman core programs help new students learn their way
        around the college&amp;#8217;s unique curriculum. The interdisciplinary, team-taught system
        &amp;#8220;works for those seeking the freedom to chart their own course,&amp;#8221; says
        the guide.</p>
       <p>&amp;#8220;The quality of the teaching is incredible,&amp;#8221; notes one student.
        &amp;#8220;Professors actually get to know each individual student and are very
        knowledgeable.</p>
       <p>Evergreen&amp;#8217;s environmentally friendly buildings, locally sourced food and
        peaceful green campus score high marks, while its sports programs and geographic location
        are also cited as adding to a high quality of life for students.</p>
       <p>The Evergreen State College is a nationally recognized public liberal arts and sciences
        college known for its distinctive interdisciplinary curriculum, high level of
        student/faculty engagement and emphasis on putting learning into action.</p>

       <p>The following statement is from Thomas L. Purce, president of The Evergreen State
        College.</p>
       <p>&amp;#8220;Washington legislators reached an agreement on the state&amp;#8217;s operating
        budget yesterday, and there is some good news. While Evergreen&amp;#8217;s budget will not
        change much, the final legislative budget calls for no tuition increase in 2013-2014 for
        resident undergraduate students.</p>
       <p>After years of dramatic tuition increases and equally dramatic state cuts, this is a
        welcome change.</p>
       <p>The state budget is not final until action by both chambers of the legislature and by the
        governor. Details remain to be analyzed and some big issues (for instance, the capital
        budget) remain unresolved. But we can celebrate this positive development, which should ease
        the burden on many students and allow us to make some progress on our most critical
        budgetary needs.&amp;#8221;</p>
       <p>Final action on the budget is expected shortly. Details are available on <a
         href="http://blogs.evergreen.edu/officeofgovernmentalrelations/blog/2013/06/27/there-is-a-budget-deal/"

       <p>(Olympia, Wash.) Fans of science will love the 10th annual Evergreen Science Carnival and
        Research Exposition taking place from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. on Friday, May 31 and Saturday, June
        1 at The Evergreen State College&amp;#8217;s Olympia campus, 2700 Evergreen Parkway NW. The
        Science Carnival offers hundreds of presentations by Evergreen science students with an
        emphasis on demonstration, hands-on participation and fun. Designed for students from

        Guide; Organic Tie-Dye; Don&amp;#8217;t Tell Mom the Daphnia&amp;#8217;s Dead; and Nutrition
        &amp;#8211; What Does Food Do for You? The event, the largest of its kind in Washington, is
        free and open to the public. For free parking on Friday, tell the parking attendant you are

       <h2>The Evergreen State College Roll Call Memorial, Remembering Fallen U.S. Service Members
        Resumes May 22</h2>
       <p>(Olympia, Wash.) The Evergreen State College is inviting the public to participate in its
        the third Memorial Day commemoration honoring the U.S. military men and women of all races,
        faiths and nationalities who have died while serving in the Global War on Terror.</p>
       <p>The Readers Project: Honoring the Fallen will take place on the college&amp;#8217;s Red
        Square, Wednesday, May 22 from Noon to 1 p.m. The college is located at 2700 Evergreen
        Parkway NW in Olympia. Parking on campus is $1.00 for a two-hour pass.</p>
       <p>The Veterans of Evergreen Transition and Success team (VETS), an advisory group comprised
        of Evergreen staff, faculty and students is organizing the event.</p>
       <p>&amp;#8220;The Evergreen State College is proud to provide this opportunity for the
        community to recognize the fallen service members and contemplate the profound sacrifices
        that military families and communities throughout the nation are continuing to
        make,&amp;#8221; noted VETS member Paul Gallegos.</p>
       <p>At the ceremony, everyone in attendance will be invited to join in a public reading of the
        names of the service members who perished within the last twelve months as a chorus of
        respect and remembrance for approximately 250 military personnel who have made the ultimate
        sacrifice for their country. In addition, an exhibit of the names of all the U.S. military
        fatalities since the start of the war will be on display in Evergreen&amp;#8217;s Daniel J.
        Evans Library lobby from May 20 through graduation day, June 14.</p>
       <p>The ceremony resumes the roll call memorial that has taken place at the college for the
        past two years. In 2011, members of the community were selected to recite the names of all
        6,058 U.S. service members who had at that point been identified by the Department of
        Defense as fatalities in the various campaigns of the Global War on Terror. In 2012,
        selected community readers recited the names of 422 U.S. service members who had been
        identified as fatalities within the prior 12 months. This year, everyone present will be
        able to read along as the name and image of each fallen warrior is displayed.</p>
       <p>The college will be closed May 27 in observance of Memorial Day.</p>

       <p>OLYMPIA, Wash.--KAOS 89.3 FM Olympia Community Radio, celebrating its 40th Anniversary
        kicks off its first Membership Drive of 2013 on Monday, April 8. The 40-hour/ten day drive
        will end Thursday, April 18. New supporters and renewing KAOS members are encouraged to help
        support Olympia&amp;#8217;s first public radio station; recently selected by readers of the
        Weekly Volcano as &amp;#8220;Thurston County&amp;#8217;s Best Radio Station..&amp;#8221;</p>
       <p>During the drive, KAOS listeners can call in their support to the station&amp;#8217;s main
        studio line at (360) 867-5267 (867-KAOS), or they can join securely online by visiting the
        KAOS Web site at www.kaosradio.org.</p>
       <p>All funds raised are used to support the programming and training activities of KAOS
        Olympia Community Radio. Celebrating 40 years of community service, KAOS has been the South
        Sound&amp;#8217;s only full-time, full-power commercial-free public radio service, offering
        a wide range of independent music, local and global news, and community information since
        1973.</p>
       <p>&amp;#8220;Since 1973, no matter the economic situation, KAOS has been there, always
        available; with consistent public service programming and entertainment from the community,
        for the community,&amp;#8221; says John Ford, KAOS Development Director. &amp;#8220;That
        we&amp;#8217;re still here 40 years later is a testament to our social commitment and I
        believe our community values the independent resource that is KAOS - Olympia&amp;#8217;s
        Community Radio.&amp;#8221;</p>
       <p>In 2008, 2009, 2012 and 2013, KAOS was selected by Princeton Review as one of the most
        popular college radio stations in the US. 2012 also found KAOS recognized by Performer
        Magazine as one of the top 10 non-commercial radio stations in the nation, based on the
        breadth of diversity in the artists aired there.</p>
       <p>The station streams its broadcasting live online at <a href="http://www.kaosradio.org"
         >www.kaosradio.org</a>, and can be heard on Comcast cable in Thurston County on Comcast
        Digital Cable channel 982.</p>
       <p>One of Thurston County&amp;#8217;s largest volunteer-based organizations, KAOS is
        programmed by a staff of nearly 100 student and community volunteers. Their varied
        perspectives and sensibilities make KAOS a unique resource for information and entertainment
        ignored by major media.</p>

       <p>Olympia, Wash. &amp;#8211; According to a new <a
         href="http://www.evergreen.edu/about/impact/Evergreen-Impact-Study-2013.pdf">economic
         impact study by ECONorthwest</a>, <strong>The Evergreen State College in Olympia generated
         $161.3 million in total economic activity in Thurston County alone in fiscal year 2012,
         including $83.1 million in income and 1,590 jobs.</strong></p>
       <p><strong>The report notes that the college generated $4 in economic activity for every
         state dollar invested.</strong> That jumps to $20.63 if the increased annual earnings of
        alumni living in Washington are taken into account, compared to what they would have made
        without their college degree.</p>
       <p>According to the report, &amp;#8220;&amp;#8230;spending that is directly attributed to
        Evergreen starts a chain reaction of additional economic activity that supports sales,
        incomes, and jobs in every sector of the Thurston County economy and beyond the county as
        well.&amp;#8221;</p>
       <p>&amp;#8220;The large economic presence of state government here in Olympia sometimes
        overshadows the substantial economic impact Evergreen, its students, and its alumni have on
        the local and state economy,&amp;#8221; explained Evergreen spokesperson Todd Sprague.
        &amp;#8220;This study gives us a clearer picture of the scale and reach of economic benefits
        that extend well beyond the value our students and alumni receive from their education. The
        college is an economic driver that not only supports our local and statewide work force,
        accounting for 15% of all bachelor&amp;#8217;s degrees in Thurston County and nearly 22,000
        statewide, it generates more than $100 million in net economic activity and hundreds of jobs
        that would not be in Washington at all if Evergreen did not exist.&amp;#8221;</p>
       <p>The executive summary and the full ECONorthwest report, including a profile of the college
        and information about the successes of Evergreen&amp;#8217;s alumni, are available at <a

       <h2>Study Highlights</h2>
       <h3>ROI for the State and Community</h3>
       <ul>
        <li>Evergreen generated $161.3 million in total economic activity in Thurston County in
         fiscal year 2012, including $83.1 million in income and 1,590 jobs.</li>
        <li>The college generated $4 in economic activity for every state dollar invested. That
         jumps to $20.63 if the increased annual earnings of alumni living in Washington are taken
         into account, compared to what they would have made without their college degree.</li>
        <li>Student off-campus spending alone generated $40.1 million in economic impact in Thurston
         County in 2012, including $12.1 million in income and 389 jobs.</li>
        <li>If Evergreen was a private employer, it would rank as the fourth largest in the
         county.</li>
        <li>Evergreen has a strong &amp;#8220;Buy Local&amp;#8221; track record - 59% of all
         operational spending benefits employees and business owners in Thurston County and 83%
         benefits employees and business owners in Washington.</li>
        <li>The college generated $102.1 million in net economic activity in Washington that would
         not have occurred in the state if not for the presence of Evergreen.</li>
        <li>Every million dollars in direct spending by Evergreen generates another $1.3 million in
         spending elsewhere in the economy.</li>
        <li>Every million dollars in direct income paid by Evergreen is linked to another $500,000
         in income in other sectors of the local economy.</li>
        <li>Every 10 direct jobs at the college are linked, on average, to another 12 local
         jobs.</li>
        <li>Evergreen alumni account for 15% of all bachelor&amp;#8217;s degrees in Thurston
         County.</li>
       </ul>
       <h3>ROI for Students and Alumni</h3>
       <ul>
        <li>A leader in time to degree among Washington&amp;#8217;s public baccalaureate (four-year)
         institutions (3.98 years).</li>
        <li>Second highest four-year graduation rate among Washington&amp;#8217;s public
         baccalaureate institutions.</li>
        <li>52 percent of 2011 graduates finished with no loan history at Evergreen and those with
         debt were well below state and national averages.</li>
        <li>Evergreen alumni have earnings comparable to other college graduates in the same fields
         and careers (fields in which Evergreen graduates are represented at higher than average
         levels: Science - Life, Physical and Social; Education, Training, Library; Arts, Design,
         Entertainment, Sports, and Media; Computer and Mathematical - for older graduates; Legal -
         for older graduates; Farming, Fishing, and Forestry).</li>
        <li>Evergreen alumni make an average of $22,600 more in annual average lifetime earnings
         than if they had not attended college. That means it takes about four years of increased
         annual average lifetime earnings to pay back the entire cost of four years at
         Evergreen.</li>
        <li>Evergreen alumni living in Washington earn approximately $433 million more each year
         than if they had not attended college. They pay an additional $47 million a year in state
         and local taxes based on that increased income.</li>
       </ul>
       <h3>About Evergreen&amp;#8217;s Students</h3>
       <ul>
        <li>Three-quarters of students are Washington residents.</li>
        <li>81 percent of 2011 graduates belonged to at least one traditionally under-served
         population (low income, students of color, first generation to attend college, veterans,
         students with a disability, older than average).</li>
        <li>50 percent hold down a job while going to school.</li>
       </ul>

       <h2>Filmmaker Lyda Kuth will present LOVE AND OTHER ANXIETIES on February 26</h2>
       <p>(OLYMPIA, WA) Lyda Kuth and her husband Kent Christman were both born in Ohio and enrolled
        at The Evergreen State College in the first few years after its opening in 1971. Nearly a
        decade later, they crossed paths in Boston and later married. Their relationship, and the
        universal uncertainties of finding and staying in love, is the subject of Kuth's first
        feature film, a personal documentary, "Love and Other Anxieties." Kuth, a 1978 Evergreen
        graduate, will be at the college's Olympia campus on <strong>Tuesday, February 26,
         2013</strong> to meet students and faculty, present a public screening of her film and
        answer questions. <strong>The public screening is at 6:30 p.m.</strong> in Lecture Hall
        Three. The film runs 66 minutes and will be followed by questions and answers. The event is
        free and open to the public. Parking is $2.</p>
       <p>After two decades of giving grants to New England artists and filmmakers as the executive
        director of the LEF Foundation in Cambridge, MA, Kuth secretly contemplated making a film.
        She finally admitted this desire in her mid 50s, around the time her only daughter was
        preparing to go to college.</p>
       <p>Kuth decided she wanted to talk with young people in her daughter's generation about their
        expectations for marriage and long-term commitment. In one scene she travels to Evergreen
        and interviews faculty member Stephanie Coontz-an internationally recognized author and
        expert on the history and culture of marriage-and her students. These interviews helped
        launch and are part of "Love and Other Anxieties," in which Kuth also turns the camera on
        her own "average" love story.</p>
       <p>The Boston Globe's film critic Ty Burr called "Love and Other Anxieties" "extraordinarily
        touching in its very ordinariness" and that it bears witness to "the ache we all have to
        keep love fresh."</p>
       <p>Kuth has appeared with the film at film festivals throughout the country and the film had
        its theatrical premiere in Brookline, MA in November. This event is the Pacific Northwest
        premiere.</p>

       <p>TED (www.ted.com), known for its "TEDTalks," is a nonprofit devoted to "Ideas Worth
        Spreading" by challenging the world's most fascinating thinkers and doers to give the talk
        of their lives (in 18 minutes or less) at one of their global conferences. TEDx
        (www.ted.com/tedx) programs are designed to give communities, organizations and individuals
        the opportunity to stimulate dialogue through TED-like experiences at the local level. TEDx
        events are fully planned and coordinated independently, on a community-by-community basis.
        TEDxTheEvergreenStateCollege is an independently organized event, operated under license
        from TED.</p>
       <h3>About TEDx, x = independently organized event</h3>
       <p>In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events
        that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video
        and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. These
        local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event.
        The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx
        events, including TEDxTheEvergreenStateCollege, are self-organized (subject to certain rules
        and regulations). About TED</p>
       <p>TED is a nonprofit organization devoted to Ideas Worth Spreading. Started as a four-day
        conference in California 26 years ago, TED has grown to support those world-changing ideas
        with multiple initiatives. At TED, the world's leading thinkers and doers are asked to give
        the talk of their lives in 18 minutes. Talks are then made available, free, at TED.com. TED
        speakers have included Bill Gates, Jane Goodall, Elizabeth Gilbert, Sir Richard Branson,
        Benoit Mandelbrot, Philippe Starck, Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, Isabel Allende and former UK Prime
        Minister Gordon Brown. Two major TED events are held each year: The TED Conference takes
        place every spring in on the West Coast (along with a parallel conference, TEDActive), and
        TEDGlobal is held each summer in Edinburgh, Scotland.</p>
       <p>TED's media initiatives include TED.com, where new TEDTalks are posted daily; the new TED
        Conversations, enabling broad conversations among TED fans; and the Open Translation
        Project, which provides subtitles and interactive transcripts as well as the ability for any
        TEDTalk to be translated by volunteers worldwide.</p>
       <p>TED has established the annual TED Prize, where exceptional individuals with a wish to
        change the world are given the opportunity to put their wishes into action; TEDx, which
        offers individuals or groups a way to host local, self-organized events around the world;
        and the TED Fellows program, helping world-changing innovators from around the globe to
        become part of the TED community and, with its help, amplify the impact of their remarkable
        projects and activities.</p>

       <p>Evergreen students report they are as engaged as the top ten percent of 595 National
        Survey on Student Engagement (NSSE) surveyed schools on the academic challenge benchmark,
        which include such factors as first year and senior students&amp;#8217; time spent
        analyzing, synthesizing, evaluating and applying learning. Similarly students report they
        are as engaged as the top ten percent of 595 NSSE schools (both in the first year and as
        seniors) in the active and collaborative learning benchmark, which includes factors such as
        participation inside and outside class, and in community-based projects as part of a
        course.</p>
       <p>These are just some of the findings of the 2012 National Survey of Student Engagement
        (NSSE) conducted by Indiana University Center for Postsecondary Research. In fact, students
        at The Evergreen State College reported higher than average engagement in comparison with
        similar schools on all benchmark measures of the 2012 NSSE.</p>
       <p>NSSE is a survey that assesses student engagement in educational practices that are
        associated with high levels of learning and development. NSSE developed six benchmarks of
        effective educational practice that are computed based on the results of clusters of
        individual survey questions.</p>
       <p>The survey included categories measuring academic challenge, active and collaborative
        learning, student-faculty interaction, enriching educational experiences, supportive campus
        environment, and deep approaches to learning.</p>
       <p>&amp;#8220;The NSSE survey results are a real-time testament to the impressive
        collaborative work students and faculty undertake at Evergreen. The results indicate that
        students are challenged by their faculty mentors and that they regularly rise to meet those
        challenges,&amp;#8221; says Dr. Michael Zimmerman, Vice President for Academic Affairs.
        &amp;#8220;One of the most important facets of a successful educational experience, indeed,
        of success in any arena, is commitment and engagement with the task at hand.&amp;#8221;</p>
       <p>Since 2010, The Evergreen State College has made gains in all benchmark dimensions of
        NSSE, improving on levels of student engagement reported then.</p>
       <p>The National Survey of Student Engagement placed Evergreen higher in relation to
        comparative schools in achieving deeper approaches to learning through a greater emphasis on
        higher order thinking skills, integration, and reflection, as well as providing academic
        challenge, active and collaborative learning, student faculty interaction, enriching
        educational experiences, and a supportive campus environment.</p>
       <h3>Other notable results:</h3>
       <ul>
        <li>In terms of Academic Challenge, nine of ten Evergreen students reported substantial
         emphasis on analyzing basic elements of ideas and theories (90% of first-year students and
         92% of seniors) and to synthesizing and organizing ideas (89% of first-year students and
         94% of seniors).</li>
        <li>In terms of Active Learning, approximately 4 of 5 (83%) first-year students indicated
         that they discuss readings and ideas from courses outside of classes.</li>
        <li>Almost nine out of ten students (87%) indicated they felt that faculty members were
         accessible and supportive, a measure of Student Faculty Interaction.</li>
        <li>Eighty seven percent of seniors indicated they discussed career plans with advisors and
         faculty.</li>
        <li>Evergreen students also engage with different perspectives and viewpoints. Almost
         three-quarters of first-year students indicated they interact with students with different
         viewpoints from themselves (73%). A similar percentage interacted with peers from different
         racial or ethnic backgrounds (74%).</li>
        <li>Sixty-one percent of students participate in community service or volunteer work by
         their senior year.</li>
        <li>A full 88 percent rated their overall educational experience at Evergreen as either good
         or excellent.</li>

       <h2>Evergreen Student Research to Save Panamanian Three-Toed Sloth Published in International
        Peer Reviewed Journal</h2>
       <h3>Publication of student work concurrent with undergraduate work is rare</h3>
       <p>Plos One, an international, open access peer-reviewed journal published work on a rare
        species of three-toed sloths by recent graduates and a current student of The Evergreen
        State College. Publication of student work concurrent with undergraduate work is
        uncommon.</p>
       <p>Jakob Shockey of Applegate, Ore., Sam Kaviar of Louisville, Ky., and Peter Sundberg of
        Bellingham, Wash., worked together to gather population data on the pygmy three-toed sloth,
        a critically endangered species of sloth on Isla Escudo de Veraguas, Panama.</p>
       <p>Since the sloth&amp;#8217;s discovery in 2001, very little research has been conducted on
        the species and the students found it hard to separate fact and rumor.</p>
       <p>&amp;#8220;Our research is important in painting a more honest and robust picture of the
        pygmy three-toed sloth's situation and its environmental and human context to the scientific
        and conservation communities,&amp;#8221; Shockey said.</p>
       <p>&amp;#8220;Our results put the pygmy three-toed sloth&amp;#8217;s small population in a
        category of high concern,&amp;#8221; Kaviar commented.</p>
       <p>The trio also discovered that previous work conducted on the island resulted in no
        interaction with the local people, which is necessary to the protection of the species.</p>
       <p>&amp;#8220;A local member of the indigenous congress pledged to put forward a bid for
        local protection of Escudo&amp;#8217;s mangroves and the sloths, and we have shared a
        Spanish translation of our work and letter of recommendations for that effort,&amp;#8221;
        Shockey said.</p>
       <p>&amp;#8220;We did workshops in the local schools and distributed coloring books that
        fellow student Miranda Ciotti made that featured the endemic species of Escudo,&amp;#8221;
        Kaviar recalled.</p>
       <p>One of the students&amp;#8217; professor&amp;#8217;s, Heather Heying, noted that doing
        research, analysis, and writing, under an academic program at the undergraduate level and
        having it published independently from faculty&amp;#8217;s research is rare.</p>
       <p>&amp;#8220;The two-part focus these three young researchers had on both doing careful,
        rigorous science, and being respectful of the people who actually live where the sloth
        lives, is rare indeed,&amp;#8221; Heying added.</p>
       <p>The island, Isla Escudo de Veraguas, is located 18 miles off the east coast of the Panama
        and is the only place on Earth where the pygmy three-toed sloth exists. The slow-moving
        species is dependent on red mangrove trees which take up less than one percent of the
        island. Local fishermen use the Mangrove trees for cooking fires to supplement the regions
        booming tourism trade, jeopardizing the sloth&amp;#8217;s habitat.</p>
       <p>Current student and contributor to the research, Kaviar noted that Evergreen&amp;#8217;s
        unique approach to learning made a project like this come together for them.</p>
       <p>&amp;#8220;Evergreen helped me hone my powers of logic, and deduction and also gave me the
        confidence to undertake a study of this kind&amp;#8230;.we owe it to the sloths, the local
        people, and ourselves to communicate honestly and openly,&amp;#8221; Kaviar added.</p>
       <p>A non-profit organization, Plos One is an international, peer-reviewed, open access,
        online publication.</p>

       <h2>Evergreen Ranks Well in Two Recent Surveys Focused on Veterans and the Military
        Community</h2>
       <p>Evergreen ranked 47 among four-year schools recognized as &amp;#8220;Best for
        Vets&amp;#8221; by Military Times.</p>
       <p>The 2013 survey of some 650 schools documents widespread efforts by schools to welcome
        veterans and active duty service members. Recognizing the work of the college&amp;#8217;s
        office of Veterans Affairs and participation in tuition programs and activities that welcome
        veterans, Evergreen, along with Olympic College in Bremerton, was only one of two in the top
        50 ranked.</p>
       <p>This comes on top of inclusion in the 2013 Guide to Military Friendly Schools published by
        G.I. Jobs. Evergreen was recommended for this list based on student reviews and measures of
        financial and institutional support, flexibility, and degree options offered. The Military
        Friendly Schools list honors the top 15 percent of colleges, universities and trade schools
        which are doing the most to embrace America&amp;#8217;s veterans and military community and
        to ensure their success.</p>
       <p>Evergreen has been included in the Military Friendly Schools guide continuously since
        2011.</p>

       <h2>Evergreen&amp;#8217;s Annual Roll Call Remembers Fallen U.S. Service Members</h2>
       <h3>The Readers Project: Honoring the Fallen</h3>
       <p>On May 24th, 2012, The Evergreen State College invited the community to its second annual
        memorial in honor of the U.S. military men and women of all races, faiths and nationalities
        who have died while serving in the Global War on Terror. Community members recited the names
        of the 422 servicemen and women who had been killed between May 1, 2011 and April 30, 2012.
        Readers included Evergreen students, staff, and faculty, veterans, and active-duty
        representatives from Joint Base Lewis-McChord and Naval Base Kitsap. In addition to the
        twelve month casualty roll call, the complete roster of U.S. military fatalities in the
        Global War on Terror was available for viewing along with data on coalition forces losses,
        civilian casualties, and war refugee data in the College&amp;#8217;s library lobby from May
        24 through June 15.</p>
       <p>The College held the first Readers Project memorial on May 26, 2011, when the college
        invited members of the community to recite the names of the 6,058 U.S. service members who
        had been officially identified up to that point in time as fatalities in the various
        campaigns of the Global War on Terror. The memorial lasted ten hours and involved 42
        readers.</p>
       <p>Reflecting on the 2011 memorial, Evergreen faculty member Sylvie McGee remarked,
        &amp;#8220;I want to remember that the moment before, these young people were full of life
        &amp;#8211; loving their families, grooving to their tunes, sending emails to their
        girlfriends/boyfriends, and I hope believing that they would be home soon. We have to
        grieve, but also to celebrate the lives our fallen warriors had and lived with vigor.
        &amp;#8220;</p>
       <p>In 2012, the program was expanded to include a musical introduction and closing. Rona
        Yellowrobe Walsh performed a medley on wooden flute that included a Native American honor
        song and Taps to mark the conclusion of the reading. The College will hold the memorial
        again on May 22, 2013, to recite the names of the casualties of the prior twelve months.</p>
       <p>The observance is organized by The Veterans of Evergreen Transition and Success Team
        (VETS) to provide the community an opportunity to recognize the fallen service members and
        contemplate the profound sacrifices that military families and communities throughout the
        nation are continuing to make.</p>

       <h3>Change the Perception</h3>
       <p>The Highlands is a neighborhood of Longview, Washington. The local press and official
        statistics paint a dark picture of a community disproportionately affected by drugs, gang
        violence, and teen pregnancy.</p>
       <p>In 2010, the median household income for residents of the Highlands was a mere $24,300 and
        the unemployment rate had reached 18.2%.</p>
       <p>In an effort to change the perception of the community, the Highlands Neighborhood
        Association worked with Axelsson to develop an inspiring visual narrative of the residents
        who call the Highlands home.</p>
       <p>As a native of Sweden, Axelsson brings his own cultural perspective to this sensitive
        portrayal of low income Americans. He currently resides in Olympia, Washington. Axelsson
        created the work as his final project for Evergreen&amp;#8217;s Documentary Photography
        class in 2011.</p>

       <h3>New Technology Helps Potential Students Connect -- and Alumni Reconnect</h3>
       <p>The Evergreen State College recently completed a new virtual tour of campus complete with
        360 degree views, video footage, photographs, and a walking tour with a virtual guide.</p>
       <p>The new project is designed to convey the campus to potential applicants, augment
        Evergreen&amp;#8217;s visitor experience, assist new students and help alumni reconnect with
        the evolving campus.</p>
       <p>The tour has been online for less than two weeks and early visitors have come from across
        the country and even internationally. The tour is available from Evergreen&amp;#8217;s
        homepage at <a href="http://www.evergreen.edu">www.evergreen.edu</a> or from <a
         href="http://admissions.evergreen.edu/tour">admissions.evergreen.edu/tour</a></p>
       <p>The tour is also integrated into popular online college search tools like Cappex.com,
        Hobson&amp;#8217;s Naviance, and mycollegeguide.com. Besides the college website, the tour
        appears as a standing feature on Evergreen&amp;#8217;s Facebook page and is being promoted
        in the college&amp;#8217;s other social media.</p>
       <p>Next steps over coming months will include efforts to enhance the site&amp;#8217;s
        existing smart phone capability, establish apps on iTunes&amp;#174; and other services,
        create more modules specific to groups of visitors, and further connect the effort to
        emerging technologies.</p>

       <p>KAOS radio has recently been recognized by Performer Magazine and The Princeton Review as
        among the top ten non-commercial radio stations in the nation.</p>
       <p>The Princeton Review developed its recognition based on student surveys across the nation,
        while Performer Magazine developed its criteria based on diversity of artists featured on
        the airwaves.</p>
       <p>&amp;#8220;With KAOS&amp;#8217; official designation as a hybrid station that combines
        serving as both a college radio station, as well as the community station model; receiving
        praise for our focus in both areas makes these rankings all the more impressive,&amp;#8221;
        says Jerry Drummond, KAOS general manager. &amp;#8220;The efforts of our many student
        volunteers, joining with the long-time community- member programmers, have gotten us this
        nationwide notoriety. As I look at the other stations included on the lists, we are
        certainly proud to be mentioned in their company.&amp;#8221;</p>
       <p>Both accolades recognize KAOS radio&amp;#8217;s efforts to provide programming that
        includes a wide range of music, women&amp;#8217;s issues, Native American, Spanish language,
        and public affairs reporting.</p>

       <h3>About Amy Goodman</h3>
       <p>Amy Goodman is an award-winning investigative journalist and syndicated columnist, author
        and the host of &amp;#8220;Democracy Now!&amp;#8221; airing on more than 1,000 public
        television and radio stations in 35 countries. Goodman is the first journalist to receive
        the Right Livelihood Award, widely known as the 'Alternative Nobel Prize' for "developing an
        innovative model of truly independent grassroots political journalism that brings to
        millions of people the alternative voices that are often excluded by the mainstream media."
        The Independent of London named Amy Goodman and Democracy Now! "an inspiration";
        pulsemedia.org placed Goodman at the top of their 20 Top Global Media Figures. Goodman is
        the author of four New York Times bestsellers. For more information about Amy Goodman and
        Democracy Now!, please visit democracynow.org.</p>
       <p>Denis Moynihan, since helping co-found &amp;#8220;Democracy Now!&amp;#8221; as an
        independent production company in 2002, has participated in the organization&amp;#8217;s
        growth, focusing primarily on distribution, infrastructure development, and coordinating
        complex live broadcasts from all continents (save Antarctica). He lives in Denver, and is
        the founder of a new noncommercial, community radio station in Colorado&amp;#8217;s high
        country.</p>
       <h3>About the Book</h3>
       <p>The Silenced Majority: Stories of Uprisings, Occupations, Resistance, and Hope, Forward by
        Michael Moore</p>
       <p>Amy Goodman &amp; Denis Moynihan provide a vivid record of the events, conflicts, and
        social movements shaping our society today. They give voice to ordinary people standing up
        to corporate and government power across the country and around the world. Their writing and
        daily work at the grassroots public TV/radio news hour Democracy Now!, carried on more than
        a thousand stations globally and at democracynow.org, casts in stark relief the stories of
        the silenced majority. These stories are set against the backdrop of the mainstream
        media&amp;#8217;s abject failure, with its small circle of pundits who know so little about
        so much, attempting to explain the world to us and getting it so wrong.</p>

       <h3>Olympia, Washington &amp;#8211; The Evergreen State College will host the tenth annual
        Latino Youth Summit on November 20.</h3>
       <p>The Latino Youth Summit, sponsored by The Hispanic Roundtable, will bring together some
        500 high school students from Thurston, Lewis, Mason, Pacific and Grays Harbor counties for
        a wide variety of workshops.</p>
       <p>This year&amp;#8217;s theme, &amp;#8220;DREAMers&amp;#8230;Change the World&amp;#8221;
        stresses the importance of nurturing aspirations as a means of connecting and empowering
        youth. Workshops will cover a multitude of topics, including applying for college and
        financial aid, healthy lifestyles, and insights into specific careers.</p>
       <p><strong>The event will also feature Sean Arce</strong>, former head of the Tucson school
        district&amp;#8217;s Mexican American Studies Program, which has helped to significantly
        improve performance by Latino students in standardized tests, retention and college
        placement rates, but is now deemed illegal under Arizona law. He and several of his fellow
        teachers formed saveethnicstudies.org to fight the law and retain these programs.</p>
       <p>Other higher education institutions, including Saint Martin&amp;#8217;s University, South
        Puget Sound Community College, and Centralia College, have supported and hosted the Summit
        throughout its ten-year history.</p>
       <p>High school students can register online at www.hispanicroundtable.org. Registration
        forms, full workshop descriptions and other documents can also be downloaded. Space is
        limited to the first 500 registrants. Unless full prior, registration will close on November
        1.</p>

       <p>OLYMPIA, Wash.--KAOS 89.3 FM Olympia Community Radio kicks off its Fall Membership Drive
        on Friday, October 5. The week-long drive will end Thursday, October 11. New supporters and
        renewing KAOS members are encouraged to help support public radio station. All funds raised
        are used to support the programming and training activities of KAOS Olympia Community Radio.
        Celebrating 39 years of community service, KAOS has been the South Sound&amp;#8217;s only
        full-time, full-power commercial-free public radio service, offering a wide range of
        independent music, local and global news, and community information since 1973. The station
        streams its broadcasting live online at www.kaosradio.org, and can be heard on Comcast cable
        in Thurston County on Comcast Digital Cable channel 982.</p>
       <p>&amp;#8220;Fundraising in the current economy is challenging to say the least; and the
        constant threat of federal defunding makes it more so,&amp;#8221; says John Ford, KAOS
        Development Director. &amp;#8220;Yet no matter the economic situation, KAOS has been there,
        always available; with consistent public service programming and entertainment from the
        community, for the community. I believe our community values the independent resource that
        is KAOS- Olympia&amp;#8217;s Community Radio.&amp;#8221;</p>
       <p>During the drive, KAOS listeners can call in their support to the station&amp;#8217;s main
        studio line at (360) 867-5267 (867-KAOS), or they can join securely online by visiting the
        KAOS Web site at www.kaosradio.org. Contributions can also be mailed to: KAOS, CAB 102, 2700
        Evergreen Pkwy NW, Olympia, WA 98505.</p>
       <p>One of Thurston County&amp;#8217;s largest volunteer-based organizations, KAOS is
        programmed by a staff of nearly 100 student and community volunteers. Their varied
        perspectives and sensibilities make KAOS a unique resource for information and entertainment
        ignored by major media.</p>

       <p>Dennis Held&amp;#8217;s poetry has been described as &amp;#8220;fresh, energetic, zany and
        good-hearted&amp;#8221; and &amp;#8220;a glimpse of an illuminated world, transformed by an
        uncompromising imagination that reveals the transcendent moments hidden away within our
        daily lives,&amp;#8221; by a recent reviewer. Held was raised in Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin.
        Transferring from UW-Waukesha to Evergreen, Held took Mass Communications and Social Reality
        and the Experience of Fiction. After graduation, he lived in Missoula, Montana for five
        years and was awarded the MFA in poetry writing. Dennis taught writing, editing and
        literature at Lewis-Clark State College in Lewiston, Idaho, from 1994 until 2001. Betting on
        the Night, a collection of poetry, was published in 2001 with Lost Horse Press, and was
        reprinted in 2003. Now living in Spokane, Washington, he teaches at Eastern Washington
        University. A second book of poetry, Ourself, was published in January 2011 by Gribble
        Press. Held Continues to publish essays, book reviews, and articles in magazines and for
        public radio.</p>
       <h3>About the series:</h3>
       <p>The Ernestine Kimbro Authors and Artists Series provides a forum for members of the
        Evergreen community to publically share their creative work. Sponsored by Library &amp;
        Media Services, the Office of Alumni Programs and the Provost&amp;#8217;s office, the series
        carries forward a tradition that Ernestine, who worked at Evergreen in different capacities
        for many years until her death in 2008, masterminded and kept alive even in her final weeks
        at the College.</p>
       <p>Ernestine worked at Evergreen from 1973-79, 1986 and from 1990 until her death in 2008. As
        a faculty member, she taught philosophy, writing, library and information science,
        literature, cultural studies, and women's studies. She viewed teaching to be a privilege and
        set high standards of professionalism for herself and high standards of achievement from her
        students. Outside the classroom, Ernestine created a grand lifestyle shaped by her passions
        and pursuits in art, music, reading, writing, gardening, and conversation.</p>

       <h2>For the Fourth Year Running, The Evergreen State College has been Named a &amp;#8220;Best
        Buy&amp;#8221; in the Fiske Guide to Colleges</h2>
       <p>In 2013, the <strong>Fiske Guide to Colleges</strong> has designated 41
        institutions&amp;#8212;20 public and 21 private&amp;#8212;as <em>Best Buys</em>. The
        Evergreen State College is one of two colleges in the Pacific Northwest chosen for this
        accolade.* In selecting Best Buy schools, the Fiske Guide reviewed more than 300 colleges
        (of more than 2,200 four year colleges in the United States.)</p>
       <p>All of the <em>Best Buy</em> schools fall into the inexpensive or moderate price category,
        and the designation is a recognition of value, quality of life and academics at the college.
        The Fiske Guide does not just look at cost, but also academic quality, social life and
        overall quality of life in determining whether to include schools in its guide or in its
        Best Buy lists.</p>
       <ul>
        <li>
         <strong>Oregon State University is the other best buy school in the Pacific
          Northwest.</strong>
        </li>
       </ul>
       <h3>About the 2013 Fiske Guide to Colleges</h3>
       <p>For more than 25 years, millions of parents, counselors, and college-bound students have
        turned to <em><strong>The Fiske Guide to Colleges</strong></em> for its perspective on the
        distinctive personalities of the best and most interesting colleges and universities in the
        United States., Canada, and Great Britain.</p>
       <h3>About the Author</h3>
       <p>In 1980, when he was education editor of the <em>New York Times</em>, Edward B. Fiske
        sensed that college-bound students and their families needed better information on which to
        base their educational choices. Thus was born the <em>Fiske Guide to Colleges</em>. A
        graduate of Wesleyan University, Fiske did graduate work at Columbia University and assorted
        other bastions of higher learning.</p>
       <p>He left the <em>New York Times</em> in 1991 to pursue a variety of educational and
        journalistic interests, including a book on school reform, Smart Schools, Smart Kids. When
        not visiting colleges, he can be found playing tennis, sailing, or doing research on the
        educational problems of South Africa and other Third World countries for UNESCO and other
        international organizations. Fiske lives in Durham, N.C., near the campus of Duke
        University, where his wife, Helen Ladd, is a member of the faculty. They are coauthors of
         <em>When Schools Compete: A Cautionary Tale, Elusive Equity: Education Reform in
         Post-Apartheid South Africa</em>, <em>and Handbook of Research in Education, Finance and
         Policy.</em></p>

       <p>&amp;#8220;Higher education is more than a credentialing process,&amp;#8221; says Michael
        Zimmerman, academic vice president and provost of The Evergreen State College.
        &amp;#8220;What we need is to re-emphasize the demonstrated, research-supported, and obvious
        role that liberal arts plays in today&amp;#8217;s world, a world where the ability to think
        strategically, across disciplinary boundaries and creatively is the premium value arising
        from higher education. Liberal arts graduates strengthen Washington&amp;#8217;s economy and
        help transform communities.&amp;#8221;</p>
       <p>Ideas like this will be the subject of conversation as more than 60 academic leaders
        throughout the state converge on The Evergreen State College in Olympia on July 19 to
        discuss steps toward building a coalition and action plan to advocate for liberal arts
        education in Washington.</p>
       <p>Washington State House Democrat and educational leader, Mary Helen Roberts, will be the
        keynote speaker at the event, providing her observations on the value and importance of the
        liberal arts and the state of education in the State of Washington more generally.</p>
       <p>Michael Zimmerman, who is convening the meeting at Evergreen, sees it as an opportunity to
        renew the discussion on liberal arts, particularly its important role in the changing global
        and Washington State economy and society.</p>
       <p>&amp;#8220;As a biologist and a representative of a college with a vibrant scientific
        community, I am an advocate for scientific and technological disciplines, but the State of
        Washington also has to broaden its support and recognize the energy and foundational value
        that the wider range of liberal arts brings to civil society and the creative economy. If
        higher education becomes one-dimensional, we all suffer.&amp;#8221;</p>
       <p>Zimmerman is enthused by the immediate and positive response he has received in regard to
        the event. &amp;#8220;Being new to the state, I reached out to academic leaders across the
        state, from both public and private institutions, to see if we could help shape the dialogue
        about higher education. The response overwhelmed me! More than 60 administrators have
        decided to bring this to the forefront of their institutional agendas and attend this
        organizational meeting.&amp;#8221;</p>
       <p>The &amp;#8216;Liberal Arts Washington&amp;#8217; meeting takes place from 9:30 a.m. to 3
        p.m. on July 19 at The Evergreen State College campus located at 2700 Evergreen Parkway NW,
        Olympia.</p>

       <h2>Washington State History Museum Unveils 2012 <em>In the Spirit</em> Exhibit, One of the
        Largest Native American Arts Showcases in the Northwest</h2>
       <h3>Opening June 21, the annual art exhibit displays a rich blend of cultural heritage and
        contemporary expression</h3>
       <p>The seventh annual In the Spirit: Contemporary Northwest Native Arts exhibit debuts
        Thursday, June 21, with a free opening reception for the artists and guests at the
        Washington State History Museum in Tacoma. The exhibit displays artwork from more than two
        dozen Native American tribes and runs through August 26, 2012, culminating with the In the
        Spirit: Northwest Native Arts Market &amp; Festival on Saturday, August 11, 2012. The
        two-month exhibit is curated and juried through a partnership with The Evergreen State
        College Longhouse Education &amp; Cultural Center, and celebrates the cultural traditions
        and modern expression of Native artists throughout the Pacific Northwest.</p>
       <p>&amp;#8220;This annual exhibit has become a rich cultural tradition for our region and,
        with 14 new exhibitors this year alone, it continues to grow year after year to impact new
        audiences,&amp;#8221; said Jennifer Kilmer, Executive Director of the Washington State
        Historical Society. &amp;#8220;It&amp;#8217;s a privilege to be able to recognize the work
        of so many talented artists in a way that honors their distinctive histories and
        culture.&amp;#8221;</p>
       <p>In addition to the new exhibitors, this year&amp;#8217;s show also welcomes back a
        two-time &amp;#8216;Best in Show&amp;#8217; winner, Jerry Laktonen, and several prior
        participants. There will be more than 30 pieces this year &amp;#8211; one of the largest In
        the Spirit exhibits yet &amp;#8211; that have been created by more than 25 Native American
        artists. Each artist has a unique vision and aesthetic, and the pieces range from woven
        capes and skirts, to red cedar carvings, feathered masks and oil paintings.</p>
       <p>During the opening night reception, on &amp;#8216;Free Third Thursday,&amp;#8217; June 21
        at 6 p.m., museum-goers are invited to mingle with the artists and other guests, and applaud
        the artists&amp;#8217; accomplishments as awards are announced. The three-person judging
        panel, comprised of Native American art experts and artists, will present this
        year&amp;#8217;s winners in four categories: &amp;#8220;Best of Show,&amp;#8221;
        &amp;#8220;Celebrating the Northwest,&amp;#8221; &amp;#8220;Celebrating Tradition&amp;#8221;
        and &amp;#8220;Celebrating Innovation.&amp;#8221; A &amp;#8220;People&amp;#8217;s
        Choice&amp;#8221; award is voted on by visitors throughout the exhibit and awarded during
        the Festival on August 11th.</p>
       <p>&amp;#8220;After seven successful years partnering with the Washington State Historical
        Society for In the Spirit, the unity of the opening ceremony is still a remarkable event to
        witness,&amp;#8221; said Tina Kuckkahn-Miller, Director, Longhouse Education and Cultural
        Center at The Evergreen State College. &amp;#8220;The evening brings together so many unique
        and revered artists to celebrate their work and share it with the public, and is a
        fundamental reason why this exhibit is a continued success.&amp;#8221;</p>
       <p>Exhibit hours are Monday &amp;#8211; Sunday, 10 a.m. &amp;#8211; 5 p.m., with extended
        hours and free admission every third Thursday, 2 &amp;#8211; 8 p.m. General admission: $9.50
        for adults; $7 for seniors; $7 students and military with valid ID; children, age 5 and
        below, and members are always free. The In the Spirit exhibit and festival are organized by
        the Washington State Historical Society and The Evergreen State College; made possible in
        part by The Bamford Foundation, Tacoma Arts Commission, and our media sponsor KUOW.</p>

       <p>Janet O&amp;#8217;Halloran, Kate Hudson (formerly Trafton) and Tim Holman have been
        selected as Kindergarten&amp;#8208;12 Distinguished Educators of 2012 by The Evergreen State
        College.</p>
       <p>Evergreen recognizes and honors these alumni educators because of their significant
        contributions to the field of education.</p>
       <p>Tim Holman, MiT 1999, is the High School Distinguished Educator Award Recipient for 2012.
        For the past 13 years, Tim has taught in the Jefferson County Public Schools in Louisville,
        KY. He currently teaches AP US and Comparative Government and Politics at duPont Manual High
        School in down&amp;#8208;town Louisville. Tim is the lead assistant basketball coach for the
        2012 State Champion Lady Crimsons Basketball team and is a member of the School Based
        Decision Making Team. Tim is married and resides in the historic Cherokee Triangle
        neighborhood. Tim&amp;#8217;s nomination was based on his outstanding work with students;
        his excellent abilities as a department chair and curriculum developer; and his dedication
        to bringing community members and important political figures into direct conversation with
        his students.</p>
       <p>Kate Hudson (formerly Trafton), MiT 2004, is the Middle School Distinguished Educator
        Award Recipient for 2012. She has been a teacher at Marshall Middle School in the Olympia
        School District for nearly 7 years. For most of that time, she&amp;#8217;s taught 6th grade
        Math and Science. Prior to her work at Olympia School District, she taught 7th and 8th grade
        math in the North Thurston schools. Always a go&amp;#8208;to person among staff, Kate
        increased her involvement this year by becoming the building representative for the Olympia
        Education Association. Kate is committed to helping others succeed and reaches out to new
        teachers. She has mentored several Evergreen practicum and student teachers. After years of
        focus on math instruction, Kate has shifted her attention back toward science. She helped
        start the annual science expo at Marshall Middle School, and she runs an
        after&amp;#8208;school science club. Working with this highly motivated group of young
        scientists is a highlight in Kate&amp;#8217;s week. Next year she will help bring a
        pre&amp;#8208;robotics curriculum to 6th grade students at Marshall. Kate&amp;#8217;s
        principal, John Hitchman, stated, &amp;#8220;I cannot overemphasize Kate&amp;#8217;s
        positive impact on the sixth graders in our building, her colleagues in the building, and
        the 5th grade math teachers in the district. She is a game changer and extremely valuable to
        the Olympia School District.&amp;#8221;</p>
       <p>Janet O&amp;#8217;Halloran, MiT 1998, is the Elementary Distinguished Educator Award

       <p>
        <em>Is a Flourishing Earth Possible? What are the Challenges for Modern Business?</em>
       </p>
       <p>Philosopher, professor, and editor of <em>Science, Wisdom, and the Future:
         Humanity&amp;#8217;s Quest for a Flourishing Earth</em>, Cheryl Genet, Ph.D. will share
        insights, possibilities, and further questions as she draws from the expertise and
        scholarship of 41 authors, whose insights explain the multitude of challenges that face us,
        while also relaying hope, vision and solutions for our future.</p>
       <p>As the final speaker for the year-long programs, <em>Business and Sustainability: Myth or
         Method?</em> and <em>Social Entrepreneurship and Sustainable Business Management</em>, we
        will ask:</p>
       <p>&amp;#8220;What does it mean to live sustainably on a personal, local, and global
        level?</p>
       <p>How can we take these ideas, and create lives, businesses, and communities that live
        sustainably with each other and the Earth?</p>
       <p>How can we promote and implement concepts of social change, ethics, personal and community
        enrichment, and support our goals in forming pathways toward cultural, economic, and
        environmental sustainability?</p>
       <p>Cheryl Genet will explore important themes that arise from conversations among the
        book&amp;#8217;s authors, including: Our interconnectedness with all life; the importance of
        community, relationships, and wisdom; our impact on living systems and resources of our
        planet; the urgent need to address our daunting reality and our future; our scientific
        cosmology&amp;#8217;s capacity to inform and guide us.</p>
       <p>Cheryl Genet, Ph.D., is the Managing Editor of the Collins Foundation Press
        (CFP)&amp;#8212;the publishing division of the Collins Educational Foundation (CEF). She is
        the director of the CEF&amp;#8217;s Science and Humanities Program and its
        &amp;#8220;Flourishing Earth Project,&amp;#8221; a collaborative effort to create a dialogue
        about what a flourishing Earth would be like. The program promotes and supports efforts
        towards a sustainable future for ourselves, and the planet we call home. She is a instructor
        of World Religions and Philosophy at Cuesta College in San Luis Obispo, California, and
        pursues research in interfaith relations, cosmological stories, and understanding our
        emerging global community.</p>
       <p>Cheryl is married to Russell M. Genet, Ph.D., a Research Scholar in Residence at
        California Polytechnic State University, Adjunct Professor of Astronomy at Cuesta College,
        and Director of the Orion Observatory. They have written papers, convened conferences, and
        carried on an interdisciplinary dialogue about cosmological traditions from the
        world&amp;#8217;s science and wisdom traditions, raising challenging political, economic,
        and social questions about how to apply this information to real-world challenges. Her
        presentation, &amp;#8220;Science, Wisdom, and the Future,&amp;#8221; is the sequel to Russ
        Genet&amp;#8217;s presentation, tracing humanities discovery of the cosmos, for the
        &amp;#8220;Cosmology and Consciousness Summer Lecture Series, 2011,&amp;#8221; made possible
        by the Noosphere Award from The Evergreen State College Foundation ().</p>
       <p>This event was sponsored by: <em>Business and Sustainability: Myth or Method?</em> (an
        Evergreen program led by Bob McIntosh and Rebecca Chamberlain); <em>Social Entrepreneurship
         and Sustainable Business Management</em> (Thuy Vu), and Evergreen&amp;#8217;s academic
        deans.</p>

       <h2>Evergreen is Individual Conference Champion for EPA&amp;#8217;s 2011-2012 College &amp;
        University Green Power Challenge</h2>
       <p>Olympia, WA &amp;#8212; The Evergreen State College announced today that it was recognized
        by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency as the 2011-2012 Individual Conference Champion
        for using more green power than any other school in the Cascade Collegiate Conference.</p>
       <p>Since April 2006, EPA&amp;#8217;s Green Power Partnership has tracked and recognized the
        collegiate athletic conferences with the highest combined green power purchases in the
        nation. The Individual Conference Champion Award recognizes the school that has made the
        largest individual purchase of green power within a qualifying conference.</p>
       <p>The Evergreen State College beat its conference rivals by using more than 14 million
        kilowatt-hours (kWh) of green power, representing 100 percent of the school&amp;#8217;s
        annual electricity usage. The Evergreen State College purchases utility green power products
        from Puget Sound Energy and Tacoma Power, helping to reduce the environmental impacts
        associated with the campus&amp;#8217; electricity use.</p>
       <p>According to the U.S. EPA, The Evergreen State College&amp;#8217;s green power use of more
        than 14 million kWh is equivalent to avoiding the carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from the
        electricity use of more than 1,000 average American homes annually, or the CO2 emissions of
        nearly 2,000 passenger vehicles per year. The Cascade Collegiate Conference&amp;#8217;s
        collective green power purchase of more than 25 million kWh is equivalent to avoiding the
        CO2 emissions from the electricity use of more than 2,000 average American homes, or the
        annual CO2 emissions of more than 3,000 passenger vehicles.</p>
       <p>&amp;#8220;EPA applauds The Evergreen State College as the Cascade Collegiate Conference
        Champion in this year&amp;#8217;s College and University Green Power Challenge,&amp;#8221;
        said Blaine Collison, Director of EPA&amp;#8217;s Green Power Partnership. &amp;#8220;By
        purchasing 100 percent renewable electricity, Evergreen is reducing harmful carbon pollution
        and showing that small schools can make a big difference for the environment.&amp;#8221;</p>
       <p>Thirty collegiate conferences and 73 schools competed in the 2011-2012 challenge,
        collectively purchasing more than 1.8 billion kWh of green power. EPA will extend the
        College &amp; University Green Power Challenge for a seventh year, to conclude in spring of
        2013. EPA&amp;#8217;s Green Power Challenge is open to all U.S. colleges, universities, and
        conferences. In order to qualify, a collegiate athletic conference must include at least one
        school that qualifies as a Green Power Partner, and the conference must collectively
        purchase at least 10 million kWh of green power. For more information, visit: <a
         href="http://www.epa.gov/greenpower/initiatives/cu_challenge.htm"
         >http://www.epa.gov/greenpower/initiatives/cu_challenge.htm</a>.</p>
       <p>Green power is electricity that is generated from environmentally preferable renewable
        resources, such as wind, solar, geothermal, biogas, biomass, and low-impact hydro. Purchases
        of green power help accelerate the development of new renewable energy capacity nationwide
        and help reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the power sector.</p>
       <p>From edible forest gardens to a salmon-safe certified organic farm to campus housing
        options in which students consciously choose a different way to relate to their natural
        world, Evergreen provides students with the opportunity to embark on new ways of thinking.
        Purchasing Green Power is an important part of Evergreen&amp;#8217;s commitment to
        sustainability.</p>

       <h3>The 2012 Readers Project: Honoring the Fallen</h3>
       <p>The Evergreen State College invites the public to its Memorial Day commemoration in honor
        of the U.S. military men and women of all races, faiths and nationalities who have died
        while serving in the Global War on Terror. The Readers Project: Honoring the Fallen will
        take place on the College&amp;#8217;s Red Square, Thursday, May 24th at Noon. It will
        include recognition of each service member who perished in the past 12 months. An exhibit of
        the names of all the U.S. military fatalities since the start of the war will be on display
        in the Library lobby from May 24 through June 15. The college will be closed May 28th in
        observance of Memorial Day.</p>
       <p>The 2012 Readers Project: Honoring the Fallen resumes the roll call memorial of the
        military dead that took place at the College one year ago. At that time, members of the
        community recited the names of all 6,058 U.S. service members who had at that point been
        identified by the Department of Defense as fatalities in the various campaigns of the Global
        War on Terror. Reflecting on the 2011 memorial, Evergreen faculty member Sylvie McGee
        remarked, &amp;#8220;I want to remember that the moment before, these young people were full
        of life &amp;#8211; loving their families, grooving to their tunes, sending emails to their
        girlfriends/boyfriends, and I hope believing that they would be home soon. We have to
        grieve, but also to celebrate the lives our fallen warriors had and lived with vigor.
        &amp;#8220;</p>
       <p>On May 24, community members will recite the names of the approximately 400 servicemen and
        women who have been killed since May 1, 2011 and April 30, 2012. Readers will include
        Evergreen students, staff, and faculty, veterans, and representatives from Joint Base
        Lewis-McChord and Naval Base Kitsap.</p>
       <p>The memorial is an opportunity for the community to recognize the fallen service members
        and contemplate the profound sacrifices that military families and communities throughout
        the nation are continuing to make.</p>
       <p>The observance is being organized by The Veterans of Evergreen Transition and Success Team
        (VETS), an advisory group comprised of Evergreen staff, faculty and students.</p>
       <p>Musical accompaniment will include Jeff Parkhurst, snare drummer for the Artesian Rumble
        Arkestra and the Squaxin Island Drummers and Singers as an opening introduction. Closing
        music will be performed by the Artesian Rumble Arkestra, Olympia&amp;#8217;s own community
        street band, and Rona Yellowrobe Walsh, who will perform a combination of a Native American
        honor song and Taps on wooden flute to mark the conclusion of the reading.</p>

        &amp;#8211; Presented by the Masters of Environmental Studies Association (MESA) at The
        Evergreen State College, Olympia WA.</p>
       <p>Just how far have we truly come since the days of Rachel Carson? How did this
        environmentalists&amp;#8217; legacy shape the current reality of pesticide use? Where do we
        need improvement and where does society still feel the impact of pesticide use? How can home
        gardeners relate to this larger issue? Gain insight to these questions and more as we host a
        panel of experts from diverse disciplines.</p>
       <p>The Evergreen State College Longhouse, Olympia WA, May 2, 2012: Expert speakers Ciscoe
        Morris (Gardening with Ciscoe), Dr. Marion Moses, Dr. Steve Herman, Dr. John Perkins, and
        Janette Brimmer of Earth Justice, will speak on the past and present implications of
        pesticide use in or society today. Moderated by Rusty Burlew of Honey Bee Suite and with
        introduction by Kaiulani Lee. Doors open at 5:00pm with tabling by local organizations; the
        panel begins at 6:00pm. This event is being produced in recognition of the 50th anniversary
        of the publication of Silent Spring, and is one of a host during April and May that
        celebrate the life of one the world&amp;#8217;s most renowned environmentalists.</p>

       <p>Yoram Bauman has a plan to solve global warming. But if you want to hear it,
        you&amp;#8217;d better be prepared to laugh first. Bauman, the self-titled
        &amp;#8220;Stand-Up Economist&amp;#8221; and ten other speakers from the Northwest were
        featured at the April16th event &amp;#8220;Hello Climate Change&amp;#8221; on The Evergreen
        State College campus. Each gave a talk on a climate change-related theme that was recorded
        and will be available soon as a TEDx talk online on the TEDx YouTube channel. TEDxEvergeen
        is an independently organized event, licensed by TED. The aim of the event was to educate
        the community about the topic of climate change and encourage faculty at the college to
        include climate change in their teaching.</p>
       <p>Bauman, an economist at the University of Washington, is an advocate of a revenue-neutral
        carbon tax similar to that levied in British Columbia and also a stand-up comic. His
        presentation pokes fun at the "Ten Principles of Economics" made famous by Harvard professor
        Greg Mankiw. &amp;#8220;It takes a Ph.D. in economics to understand these,&amp;#8221; Bauman
        begins. &amp;#8220;Fortunately I have one.&amp;#8221;</p>
       <p>The 300 attending the event -- including faculty, staff, students, and community members
        -- heard talks on topics ranging from a stripped-down description of climate change by David
        Roberts of Grist.com, to a summary of the effects of climate change on the Northwest by
        Jeremy Littell of the University of Washington Climate Resource Group. Roberts&amp;#8217;
        talk, &amp;#8220;Climate Change is Simple,&amp;#8221; emphasized that scientists have
        understood the mechanism behind global warming for over a century. Recent data suggest that
        global greenhouse gas emissions worldwide need to peak and then fall within 5 to 10 years to
        minimize the risk of uncontrolled planetary warming. But global action has been difficult to
        accomplish. &amp;#8220;Climate change is simple, not easy,&amp;#8221; said Roberts.</p>
       <p>Littell summarized the data on climate change in the region, including temperature
        increases of 1.6 degrees F since 1910 and about 1.0 F since 1960. Continued warming is
        likely to have a series of effects on the region including wetter winters and drier summers.
        Among the many impacts of these changes will be a reduction in the size of favorable habitat
        for salmon, and drier forests more susceptible to fires and insects.</p>
       <p>Other speakers included Evergreen faculty members Anne de Marcken, Larry Geri, Zoltan
        Grossman, Carolyn Prouty, Steve Verhey, and Bret Weinstein, Julia Field, founder of the
        nonprofit Undriving, which advocates for alternatives to driving, and Evergreen alumna and
        storyteller Elizabeth Lord.</p>

        that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video
        and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. These
        local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x=independently organized TED event.
        The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx
        events are self-organized.* (*Subject to certain rules and regulations)</p>
       <h3>About TED</h3>
       <p>TED is a nonprofit organization devoted to Ideas Worth Spreading. Started as a four-day
        conference in California 26 years ago, TED has grown to support those world-changing ideas
        with multiple initiatives. At TED, the world's leading thinkers and doers are asked to give
        the talk of their lives in 18 minutes. Talks are then made available, free, at TED.com. TED
        speakers have included Bill Gates, Jane Goodall, Elizabeth Gilbert, Sir Richard Branson,
        Benoit Mandelbrot, Philippe Starck, Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, Isabel Allende and former UK Prime
        Minister Gordon Brown. Two major TED events are held each year: The TED Conference takes
        place every spring in Long Beach, California (along with a parallel conference, TEDActive,
        in Palm Springs), and TEDGlobal is held each summer in Edinburgh, Scotland.</p>
       <p>TED&amp;#8217;s media initiatives include TED.com, where new TEDTalks are posted daily;
        the new TED Conversations, enabling broad conversations among TED fans; and the Open
        Translation Project, which provides subtitles and interactive transcripts as well as the
        ability for any TEDTalk to be translated by volunteers worldwide. TED has established the
        annual TED Prize, where exceptional individuals with a wish to change the world are given
        the opportunity to put their wishes into action; TEDx, which offers individuals or groups a
        way to host local, self-organized events around the world; and the TED Fellows program,
        helping world-changing innovators from around the globe to become part of the TED community
        and, with its help, amplify the impact of their remarkable projects and activities.</p>

       <h3>Thursdays, 6-9 pm, Lecture Hall 1, April 5-June 7</h3>
       <h3>Free &amp; Open to the Public</h3>
       <p>Dubbed &amp;#8220;the year of unrest,&amp;#8221; 2011 has witnessed an unprecedented
        groundswell of global popular movements demanding political, economic and social justice.
        From Tahrir Square to Zucotti Park, the desire for greater democracy has been accompanied by
        actions to reclaim public spaces where people can convene, learn about, and experiment with
        alternative forms of participatory democracy.</p>
       <p>In this spirit, Re-Interpreting Liberation, Dangerous Work, Resistance &amp; Social
        Change, and the Venezuela programs will host this Spring Symposium. Our goal is to create a
        forum to facilitate discussion across a broad range of issues and perspectives, provoking
        thought, debate, and action on issues that have accelerated to global prominence in light of
        recent movements.</p>

       <p>The U.S. Green Building Council recently announced the second certification of an
        Evergreen building under the distinguished Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design
        (LEED) Gold Certification.</p>
       <p>LEED certification is a process for ranking and recognizing &amp;#8220;green&amp;#8221;
        projects. LEED Gold constitutes the second highest ranking possible.</p>
       <p>Evergreen holds the distinction of two buildings with LEED Gold certification; Seminar
        II&amp;#8212;the first public LEED Gold Certified building in Washington (completed in
        2004)&amp;#8212;and, now, the College Activities Building (CAB) redesign completed in
        2011.</p>
       <p>The first floor renovation of the LAB I building also recently achieved LEED Silver
        certification. These three projects provide examples of architectural and design choices
        that demonstrate the campus commitment to sustainability.</p>
       <p>Many campus community members contributed to the achievement of LEED Gold certification
        for the CAB including members of the CAB pre-design and design committees, architects from
        the DLR group and college staff who worked on the project.</p>
       <p>Importantly, Evergreen students, when given the choice in the 2006 student vote, voted to
        tax themselves at the level necessary to help achieve this high standard.</p>
       <h3>Some design features leading to the new certification in the CAB include: &amp;#183;</h3>
       <ul>
        <li>a 48.5 percent reduction in energy use despite the addition of 15,000 square feet,
         &amp;#183;</li>
        <li>use of natural ventilation to cool the building in warmer months, &amp;#183;</li>
        <li>a more than 50% reduction in irrigated water use by choice of native plants for
         landscaping, plus substantial anticipated reductions of water use through the installation
         of a cistern to supply roof captured water to toilets in the building, &amp;#183;</li>
        <li>more than 75% of the wood used in the project is Forest Stewardship Council certified,
         &amp;#183;</li>
        <li>use of low VOC (volatile organic compound) materials and paints to provide a healthier
         and more environmentally friendly environment, &amp;#183;</li>
        <li>ninety-five percent of the existing CAB structure and roof were preserved in the
         remodel, reducing waste substantially, and 10 percent of new materials used in the CAB are
         from recycled sources, &amp;#183;</li>
        <li>daylight sensors are used to adjust lighting, and are coupled with energy efficient
         fixtures to decrease waste of energy from lighting.</li>
       </ul>
       <p>&amp;#8220;The college has a long-held commitment to being conscious of the impact of its
        facilities upon the environment, whether its herbicide and pesticide free policy choices,
        its electricity from renewable resources, or the commitment from top administration to see
        that new construction strives to meet at least LEED Silver criteria,&amp;#8221; says Paul
        Smith, director of facilities services.</p>
       <p>&amp;#8220;The CAB redesign was a collaborative effort that involved every part of the
        campus community, including staff, students, and faculty,&amp;#8221; add Smith.
        &amp;#8220;And we are proud of the result of our effort to reduce the building&amp;#8217;s
        environmental impacts.&amp;#8221;</p>

       <p>The Northwest Native Heritage project, with new funding from Margaret A. Cargill
        Foundation, will help to promote Native arts in the Pacific Northwest through a series of
        artist residencies, workshops and exhibitions designed to build the infrastructure for
        sharing artistic and cultural knowledge across generations.</p>
       <p>&amp;#8220;This project, proposed by our Longhouse at Evergreen, provides crucial support
        to Native artists in Washington and Oregon, helping them to participate in the economy on
        terms that are acceptable culturally and personally, and to present genuine stories from
        Native community perspectives,&amp;#8221; says Tina Kuckkahn-Miller, director of the
        Longhouse Education and Cultural Center.</p>
       <p>Funding will be used to support sharing of technical skills and cultural knowledge across
        generations, whether conveyed in visual, literary, or performance based forms, adds
        Kuckkahn-Miller. The funds solicited and received via The Evergreen State College Foundation
        will support specific projects including awards of grants, juried art shows and exhibitions,
        public awareness building efforts, and museum and reservation based workshops.</p>
       <p>&amp;#8220;We appreciate this grant as it helps us return to our roots, &amp;#8221; says
        Kuckkahn-Miller. &amp;#8220;The Longhouse was established as a bridge between Evergreen and
        tribal communities, both urban and rural. We will be working specifically with tribes in
        Oregon and Washington, and we will build upon decades-long partnerships set in motion among
        Evergreen and the surrounding Northwest tribes since 1972.&amp;#8221;</p>
       <p>&amp;#8220;The grant also represents continuing, positive interest in the real vitality in
        Northwest Native societies,&amp;#8221; adds Kuckkahn-Miller.</p>
       <p>Planning for the first projects will begin this spring and grant funding is meant to
        support projects through March 2015.</p>
       <p class="notice details">The "House of Welcome" Longhouse Education and Cultural Center is a
        public service center at The Evergreen State College. Built in collaboration with Northwest
        tribes, it is the first building of its kind on a public campus in the United States. The
        Longhouse is a multi-purpose facility, able to serve a variety of educational, cultural and
        community functions. Founded upon a vision of hospitality and service, it is a gathering
        place for people of all cultural backgrounds to teach and learn with each other. The
        Longhouse's public service mission is to promote indigenous arts and cultures through
        education, cultural preservation, creative expression and economic development.</p>

         href="http://apps.leg.wa.gov/documents/billdocs/2011-12/Pdf/Bill Reports/Senate/2585-S3 SBR WM 12.pdf"
          ><span class="s1">House Bill 2585</span></a>. These bills provide for regulatory relief in
        Evergreen&amp;#8217;s campus operations, and are welcome developments in support of our
        college&amp;#8217;s efforts to operate more efficiently.</p>
       <p class="p1">House Bill 2259 specifically eliminates a duplicative crime statistics report
        our institution has been required to report at both the state and federal levels. This one
        change will ease increased workload on staff, allowing them to focus on the day-to-day
        duties required to ensure Evergreen is running as efficiently as possible.</p>
       <p class="p1">House Bill 2585 provides for increased flexibility and reduction in procedural
        steps in purchasing and competitive bidding for purchases of $100,000 or less, advanced
        payments for equipment maintenance, travel arrangements, and more direct negotiation
        authority on purchasing.&amp;#160;</p>
       <p class="p1">&amp;#8220;Our support for these bills is entirely consistent with our
        continuing efforts at increasing efficiency and providing value in higher education for
        Washington,&amp;#8221; says Evergreen President, Dr. Thomas L. Purce. &amp;#8220;We applaud
        the efforts of the legislature to provide our institution with greater flexibility in
        difficult economic times and look forward to moving forward.&amp;#8221;</p>

       <h2>Celebrate 50 Years of Action for The Environment on May 3 at 7 pm.</h2>
       <ul>
        <li>The Willi Unsoeld Seminar and Rachel Carson Forum Present A Sense of Wonder: A Play
         Based on the Life and Works of Rachel Carson on Thursday, May 3, 7 pm, in The Longhouse
         Education and Cultural Center, The Evergreen State College, Olympia, Washington</li>
        <li>On Wednesday, May 2, 6 p.m. The Master of Environmental Studies Student Association will
         present The Social, Ecological, Economic, and Political Implications of
         &amp;#8220;Correct&amp;#8221; Pesticide Use in Our Society Today, featuring a panel of
         policy makers, activists, biological scientists, and research scientists, also in The
         Longhouse Education and Cultural Center.</li>
       </ul>
       <p>The Evergreen State College will present A Sense of Wonder--a play about Rachel
        Carson&amp;#8217;s love for nature and her fight to defend it. The performance will take
        place in the Longhouse at 7 p.m.</p>
       <p>The play, written and performed by Kaiulani Lee, has been touring the United States for
        over ten years. Lee has performed it at over one hundred universities, dozens of high
        schools, the Smithsonian Institute, the Albert Schweitzer Conference at the United Nations,
        the Sierra Club's Centennial in San Francisco, and at the Department of the Interior's 150th
        anniversary celebration.</p>
       <p>A Sense of Wonder has played throughout the provinces of Canada, in England and Italy. In
        addition, Kaiulani Lee opened the 2005 World Expo in Japan and in May 2007 performed the
        play on Capitol Hill, bringing Miss Carson&amp;#8217;s voice once again to the halls of
        Congress.</p>
       <p>The play is brought to Evergreen by the Willi Unsoeld Seminar and the Rachel Carson Forum
        in recognition of the 50 year anniversary of the publication of Silent Spring and the <a
         href="http://www.evergreen.edu/40/return/">40th anniversary</a> of the first academic year
        of The Evergreen State College. The event is free to the public, but recommended for ages 13
        and up. Parking is $2.</p>
       <p>Also on Wednesday, May 2, at 6 p.m. The Master of Environmental Studies Student
        Association will present <em>The Social, Ecological, Economic, and Political Implications of
         &amp;#8220;Correct&amp;#8221; Pesticide Use in Our Society Today</em>, featuring a panel of
        policy makers, activists, biological scientists, and research scientists, also in The
        Longhouse Education and Cultural Center.</p>
       <h3>About Rachel Carson</h3>
       <p>Rachel Carson has been called the patron saint of the environmental movement. She was a
        marine biologist and zoologist best known for her book <em>Silent Spring</em>, published in
        1962, which alerted the world to the dangers of chemical pesticides and helped to launch the
        modern environmental movement.</p>
       <h3>A Sense of Wonder</h3>
       <p>The play is the story of one woman's love for the natural world and her fight to defend
        it. It is the story of the extremely private Rachel Carson thrust into the role of
        controversial public figure.</p>
       <p>ACT I takes place in Miss Carson's summer home as she is preparing to leave. Fighting
        cancer, she fears this may well be her last visit to her beloved Maine coast.</p>
       <p>ACT II begins two months later in the wake of the furor over her book <em>Silent
         Spring</em>. Carson is simultaneously battling the chemical industry, the government, and
        the press to get her message to Congress and the American people.</p>
       <p>A Sense of Wonder has been created with the help and guidance of many of Miss Carson's
        friends and colleagues and with permission from the Rachel Carson estate.</p>
       <h3>About Kaiulani Lee</h3>
       <p>Kaiulani Lee brings to the writing and acting of A Sense of Wonder more than 35 years of
        experience in theatre, film and television. Lee has starred in over a dozen plays on and
        off-Broadway. She has been nominated for the Drama Desk Award on Broadway and has won the
        OBIE Award for outstanding achievement off-Broadway. Lee has guest-starred in numerous
        television series including Law &amp; Order, <em>The Equalizer, Tales from the Dark
         Side,</em> and <em>The Waltons.</em> Her film credits include <em>The Seduction of Joe
         Tynan</em>, <em>The Fan, Garp, Cujo</em>, and <em>Compromising Positions</em>. She starred
        as Martha Ballard in the critically acclaimed PBS film <em>A Midwife's Tale</em>. More on
        Kaiulani Lee and <em>A Sense of Wonder</em> can be found at <a

       <h3>About the Willi Unsoeld Seminar</h3>
       <p>The Willi Unsoeld Seminar Series brings to The Evergreen State College distinguished
        visitors who reflect the values and philosophy of Willi Unsoeld, a founding faculty member,
        philosopher, theologian and mountaineer. Beyond the Evergreen community, Unsoeld was well
        known for his first ascent of the West Ridge of Mt. Everest with Tom Hornbein, in which they
        made the first successful traverse of any Himalayan peak. For this feat, President John F.
        Kennedy presented them with the Hubbard Medal, The National Geographic Society's highest
        honor. The annual Willi Unsoeld Seminar is endowed as a "living memorial" in honor of Willi
        Unsoeld, whose spirit continues to influence and guide people every day.</p>
       <h3>About the Rachel Carson Forum</h3>
       <p>Students in the Master of Environmental Studies program at The Evergreen State College
        started the Rachel Carson forum in 1990. The annual celebration of author and activist
        Rachel Carson&amp;#8217;s life and achievements has included speakers on climate change and
        local sustainability. Carson&amp;#8217;s work embodies what MES students are training to do
        &amp;#8211; make a difference. Carson is known for her groundbreaking 1962 book exposing the
        dangers of pesticides, &amp;#8220;Silent Spring.&amp;#8221; Her contributions played an
        integral role leading to the ban of DDT use in the United States.</p>

       <p>In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events
        that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video
        and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. These
        local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x=independently organized TED event.
        The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx
        events are self-organized.* (*Subject to certain rules and regulations)</p>
       <h3>About TED</h3>
       <p>TED is a nonprofit organization devoted to Ideas Worth Spreading. Started as a four-day
        conference in California 26 years ago, TED has grown to support those world-changing ideas
        with multiple initiatives. At TED, the world's leading thinkers and doers are asked to give
        the talk of their lives in 18 minutes. Talks are then made available, free, at TED.com. TED
        speakers have included Bill Gates, Jane Goodall, Elizabeth Gilbert, Sir Richard Branson,
        Benoit Mandelbrot, Philippe Starck, Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, Isabel Allende and former UK Prime
        Minister Gordon Brown. Two major TED events are held each year: The TED Conference takes
        place every spring in Long Beach, California (along with a parallel conference, TEDActive,
        in Palm Springs), and TEDGlobal is held each summer in Edinburgh, Scotland.</p>
       <p>TED&amp;#8217;s media initiatives include TED.com, where new TEDTalks are posted daily;
        the new TED Conversations, enabling broad conversations among TED fans; and the Open
        Translation Project, which provides subtitles and interactive transcripts as well as the
        ability for any TEDTalk to be translated by volunteers worldwide. TED has established the
        annual TED Prize, where exceptional individuals with a wish to change the world are given
        the opportunity to put their wishes into action; TEDx, which offers individuals or groups a
        way to host local, self-organized events around the world; and the TED Fellows program,

        as KGY 1240 AM in Olympia, the area's designated emergency station.</p>
       <p>
        <strong>You can also call the main campus switchboard at anytime, 360-867-6000, to hear the
         operating status of the Olympia campus. If there is a status update, you will hear it
         immediately before the menu options.<br/>
        </strong>
       </p>
       <p>Stations in Aberdeen - 1320 AM, Centralia - 1170 AM, Shelton - 1030 AM, as well as KIRO

       <p>Evergreen's Tacoma campus follows the Tacoma School District decision.</p>
       <p><strong>Students, faculty and staff should always evaluate the conditions where they are
         and make their own decisions about travel.</strong> In Washington, weather conditions can
        vary widely from location to location, sometimes just miles away.</p>

       <p>OLYMPIA, Wash. &amp;#8212; The Evergreen State College ranks tenth in the nation on Peace
        Corps' 2012 rankings of colleges and universities in the small category (less than 5,000
        undergraduates). This ranking is up from 11 in 2011.</p>
       <p>
        <span>There are currently 20 Evergreen undergraduate alumni and six graduate alumni serving
         as Peace Corps volunteers</span>
       </p>
       <p>Corps service every year,&amp;#8221; said Peace Corps Director Aaron S. Williams.
        &amp;#8220;These alumni go on to serve as Peace Corps volunteers, applying the skills and
        knowledge they acquired during their studies to promote world peace and friendship and
        improve the lives of people around the world. Every day, volunteers make countless
        contributions to projects in agriculture, education, the environment, health and HIV/AIDS
        education and prevention, small business development, and youth development. I would like to
        extend my gratitude to all colleges and universities for their continued support of the
        Peace Corps and public service.&amp;#8221;</p>
       <p>Since 1961, more than 200 Evergreen alumni have served as Peace Corps volunteers.</p>
       <p>Today, Peace Corps volunteers work in 76 countries in the areas of education, youth and
        community development, health and HIV/AIDS, small business development, and communication
        technology, agriculture and environment.</p>
       <p>Other Washington colleges and universities that placed on the 2012 Top Colleges rankings
        are University of Washington in Seattle (rank 2 in large category), Western Washington
        University in Bellingham (rank 2 in medium category), Gonzaga University in Spokane (rank 2
        in small category), and Seattle University in Seattle (rank 8 in small category).</p>

        Kuckkahn-Miller. &amp;#8220;Funding from the Native Arts and Cultures Foundation will help
        us deepen our work within the Pacific Northwest region, and we are grateful for their

       <p>The Evergreen State College is one of the nation's "Best Value" colleges and universities
        according to The Princeton Review. One of only 75 public colleges and 75 private colleges
        recognized in this list nationally, the inclusion as a &amp;#8220;best value&amp;#8221;
        college is a recognition of both Evergreen&amp;#8217;s academic quality and its relative
        affordability.</p>
       <p>The Massachusettes-based education services company The Princeton Review profiles
        Evergreen in its just-published book, "The Best Value Colleges: 2012 Edition" and on a
        special area on its website at <a
         href="http://www.princetonreview.com/best-value-colleges.aspx"
         >http://www.princetonreview.com/best-value-colleges.aspx</a></p>
       <p>In its profile of Evergreen the editors at The Princeton Review praise the school for its
        focus on independent learning, civic involvement, and environmental commitment. Evergreen
        students responding to the survey by the Princeton Review described the college as a place
        where students &amp;#8220;learn how to change the world, realistically, responsibly, and
        effectively,&amp;#8221; and &amp;#8220;the best education for the money.&amp;#8221;</p>
       <p>Says Robert Franek, Princeton Review's senior vice president/publisher and lead author of
        The Best Value Colleges: 2012 Edition, "We commend Evergreen and all of the extraordinary
        colleges on our 2012 'Best Value Colleges' list for all they are doing to keep costs down
        and / or offer generous aid to applicants with financial need &amp;#8211; all while
        maintaining excellent academic programs."</p>
       <p>The Best Value Colleges: 2012 Edition, subtitled "The 150 Best Buy Colleges and What It
        Takes to Get In," features profiles of 75 public and 75 private colleges with detailed
        information about their campus culture, facilities and financial aid offerings. Of the 75
        schools in each group, the top 10 colleges are ranked 1 to 10, and the remaining 65 are
        listed in alphabetical order.</p>
       <p>The "Best Value Colleges" list and information about the schools are also posted on a
        dedicated area of USA TODAY.com which has been the Princeton Review's online publishing
        partner for this project since 2009. <a href="http://bestvaluecolleges.usatoday.com">USA
         TODAY&amp;#8217;s site</a> features an exclusive database that allows users to view
        in-depth details about the schools by clicking on an interactive map. Users can explore
        criteria including cost of attendance and financial aid data, enrollment size, location and
        The Princeton Review&amp;#8217;s analysis of why it chose each school as a &amp;#8220;Best
        Value.&amp;#8221;</p>
       <p>The Princeton Review selected its "Best Value Colleges" schools based on institutional
        data and student opinion surveys collected from 650 colleges and universities the company
        regards as the nation's academically best undergraduate institutions. The selection process
        analyzed more than 30 data points broadly covering academics, cost, and financial aid. Cost
        and financial aid data came from the company's fall 2011 surveys of school administrators.
        Data on academics came from its fall 2010 through fall 2011 surveys of school
        administrators. Data from students attending the schools over these years included their
        assessments of their professors and their satisfaction with their financial aid awards.</p>
       <p>The Princeton Review debuted its "Best Value Colleges" list in 2004. It previously
        published an annual book titled America's Best Value Colleges from 2004 to 2007.</p>

       <h2>Evergreen Researcher Advancing Science Education by Working Toward Deeper Exploration of
        How Students Best Learn Biology</h2>
       <h4>Clarissa Dirks to Share with the American Association for the Advancement of Science What
        Cognitive and Science Education Research Says about Helping the Nation&amp;#8217;s Students
        Learn</h4>
       <p>An undergraduate science course may be among the few places where students will gain
        exposure to the sciences that are changing the shape of society today. Evergreen professor
        Clarissa Dirks, and her collaborators, are working to ensure that students around the nation
        are better prepared to learn from those courses. Part of a national effort supported by The
        Howard Hughes Medical Institute and The National Academies, Dirks is working with colleagues
        around the nation to examine methods for engaging students in the biological sciences,
        helping them gain deep and context-rich knowledge of their subject.</p>
       <p>Next Sunday, Dirks and colleagues will be presenting their work at the American
        Association for the Advancement of Science Annual Meeting in Vancouver, BC. The title of
        their presentation: &amp;#8220;Moving (Actively) from Vision and Change in Undergraduate
        Biology Education.&amp;#8221; &amp;#8220;We are definitely putting Evergreen on the map
        because of the research we are doing and by hosting professional development workshops for
        faculty across the nation,&amp;#8221; says Dirks. &amp;#8220;The focus is to teach
        scientists how to better teach science.&amp;#8221; According to Dirks and her colleagues,
        research shows that science faculty need to use active learning in the classroom and
        administer high cognitive level exams that assess students&amp;#8217; science process and
        reasoning skills.</p>
       <p>&amp;#8220;We are aiming to go beyond multiple choice exams based on simple
        recall,&amp;#8221; says Dirks. &amp;#8220;Exams often drive student learning, so they should
        reflect the process of science and require students to analyze data, pose hypotheses, or
        design experiments with the content they are learning.&amp;#8221;</p>
       <p>And, active learning in the classroom happens when students practice working with the
        material in ways similar to how they will be tested. This is in contrast to traditional
        educational methods where the professor is lecturing and the students passively listen. The
        end goal: ensuring students retain information beyond test day and carry it forward usefully
        into their careers and lives.</p>
       <p>According to Dirks, being invited to give a 3-hour hands-on workshop on educational
        research topics at the American Association for the Advancement of Science annual meeting is
        fairly unprecedented. It is a unique opportunity to share a researched, evidence-based
        approach with policy makers and educators across the country who are interested in improving
        science education.</p>
       <p>Leaders in science education, business, and government have long recognized the increasing
        gap between the demand for science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) talent and the
        number of U.S. students interested in and prepared for pursuing degrees and careers in
        STEM-related fields. Fortunately, postsecondary education offers considerable untapped
        potential to help meet the nation&amp;#8217;s needs for greater STEM capacity and expertise,
        and best practices in science education can help to better leverage this talent.</p>
       <p>Dirks presentation draws upon work from an ongoing series of Summer Institutes on
        Undergraduate Education taking place in locations around the country and supported by the
        Howard Hughes Medical Institute and the National Academies. These institutes help train
        science faculty to use best practices in science teaching based on research from cognitive
        and learning sciences. Evergreen last hosted one of these institutes in September, 2011, and
        is set to host another summer institute in 2012.</p>

       <h4>About Clarissa Dirks</h4>
       <p>Clarissa Dirks hosted the regional National Academies Summer Institute for Undergraduate
        Science Education at Evergreen in early September, part of a series of summer institutes
        funded with a $200,000 five-year grant by the Howard Hughes Medical Institute. Most of the
        48 participants were faculty from institutions on the West Coast of the U.S.; the rest were
        postdocs, graduate students, and a few Evergreen undergraduates applying for the Masters in
        Teaching program. Each year, Dirks also co-organizes and leads a workshop for the National
        Science Foundation (NSF)-funded Faculty Institute for Reforming Science Teaching IV, a
        program that trains and mentors postdocs from around the country in best practices in
        teaching science. With additional funding from NSF, she co-founded and organized the first
        meeting of the Society for the Advancement of Biology Education Research held at the
        University of Minnesota. More than 300 attendees presented their research. Based on her role
        as a National Academies Committee Member for Dual Use Education, and with funding from the
        U.S. Dept. of State, Dirks helped run a training workshop in Trieste, Italy for faculty from
        over 15 countries. These faculty will conduct workshops in their home countries to train
        science faculty to better mentor and disseminate issues around Dual Use Research. In June
        Clarissa received a $147,574 NSF grant to develop a science process and reasoning skills
        test.</p>

       <h2>Poetry Beyond Borders: Leonard Schwartz&amp;#8217;s, Ground-Breaking Program
        &amp;#8220;Cross Cultural Poetics&amp;#8221; Introduces Poets and Listeners to One Another
        from&amp;#160;Across the World</h2>
       <p><br/> Poets from all over the world talk about their work, their language, and poetry
        &amp;#8211; &amp;#8220;the language within a language.&amp;#8221;</p>
       <p>Leonard Schwartz is aiming to engage listeners, and encourage deeper intercultural
        appreciation by broadcasting international poetry, described on the Cross Cultural Poetics
        program as &amp;#8220;the language within a language.&amp;#8221;</p>
       <p>And his work is reaching broad audiences. Through his program, he is reaching hundreds of
        thousands of listeners, and introducing poets, fiction writers, philosophers, composers,
        theater directors translators, editors and publishers from cultures across the planet to new
        audiences -- and to one another.</p>
       <p>Only 3 percent of the books published in America are in translation (as opposed to say 30%
        or 40% published in translation in Germany or France), says Schwartz. &amp;#8220;This has
        serious implications for how we hear &amp;#8211;or cannot hear &amp;#8211; other
        cultures,&amp;#8221; he adds.</p>
       <p>Cross Cultural Poetics is distinctive in that it offers listeners the chance to hear from
        voices across the world, in translation and in their own languages. Episodes have taped the
        work of poets from every continent outside Antarctica.</p>
       <p>&amp;#8220;Finding out where language is used in new ways, and figuring out what
        constitutes the new in a given cultural constellation or milieu, is always a
        challenge&amp;#8221;, says Schwartz. &amp;#8220;But if poetry is the enemy of the obvious we
        have to look for it far and wide.&amp;#8221;</p>
       <p>Cross Cultural Poetics is produced at KAOS 89.3 FM, on The Evergreen State College campus
        in Olympia, Washington and is archived and distributed globally at <a
         href="http://writing.upenn.edu/pennsound/x/XCP.php">PennSound</a> at the University of
        Pennsylvania.</p>
       <p>More than 230 episodes are available at <a
         href="http://writing.upenn.edu/pennsound/x/XCP.php">PennSound</a>. There listeners will
        find notable poets such as the Chilean poet Raul Zurita, the Caribbean poet Kamau
        Brathwaite, and the American poet Anne Waldman talking about poetry from multiple
        perspectives.</p>
       <p>The program can also be heard on <a href="http://kaos.evergreen.edu/">KAOS 89.3FM</a> on
        Thursday&amp;#8217;s at 8PM.</p>

     <title>Washington Monthly Ranks Evergreen Among Top Colleges</title>
     <summary>Among Masters Degree colleges in the United States, The Evergreen State College came

       <h3>Distinctive Ranking Evaluates Colleges Based on What They are Doing for the Country</h3>
       <p>Among Masters Degree colleges in the United States, The Evergreen State College came in
        29th in the nation according to Washington Monthly&amp;#8217;s ranking.</p>
       <p>Evergreen ranks high on the Washington Monthly list, a ranking which, according to its
        editors, asks, &amp;#8220;what are colleges doing for the country?&amp;#8221;</p>
       <p>Washington Monthly rankings are based on social mobility, which gives Evergreen credit for
        enrolling low-income students and helping them gain a degree; research production,
        particularly at schools like Evergreen that have a history of success in moving students on
        to PhDs., and commitment to service such as indicated by levels of campus participation in
        ROTC or the Peace Corps.</p>
       <p>The Washington Monthly Ranking comes immediately on the heels of accolades by <a
         href="http://www.sierraclub.org/sierra/201209/coolschools/complete-rankings-cool-schools.aspx"
         >Sierra Magazine</a>, <a href="http://www.evergreen.edu/news/archive/2012/07/bestbuy.htm"

         href="http://www.princetonreview.com/rankingsbest.aspx">Princeton Review</a>, recognizing
        the college for academic rigor, value and environmental ethics and innovation.</p>

        Walls LaNier, author of the memoir A Mighty Long Way:&amp;#160; My Journey to Justice at
        Little Rock Central High School.&amp;#160; Ms. LaNier was one of the &amp;#8220;Little Rock
        Nine,&amp;#8221; who desegregated Central High in 1957.&amp;#160; All incoming Evergreen

       <h3>About Carlotta Walls LaNier</h3>
       <p>In 1957, at age 14, Carlotta Walls LaNier was the youngest Little Rock Nine member to
        integrate Central High School.&amp;#160; This act of courage and defiance became the
        catalyst for change in the American educational system.&amp;#160; By ushering in a new
        order, she and her fellow warriors became &amp;#8216;foot soldiers&amp;#8217; for
        freedom.</p>
       <p>Despite her youth, Mrs. LaNier understood the impact of education in a promising future.
        Inspired by Rosa Parks and the desire to get the best education available, she enrolled in
        Central High School. Anger and violent behavior threatened their safety and motivated
        President Dwight D. Eisenhower to dispatch the Army&amp;#8217;s 101st Airborne Division to
        protect their constitutional rights. She graduated from Little Rock Central High School in
        1960.&amp;#160; Mrs. LaNier attended Michigan State University for two years. In 1968, she
        graduated from Colorado State College - now the University of Northern Colorado, on whose
        board of trustees she sits.</p>
       <p>Mrs. LaNier is an active supporter of her community, serving on the Board of Trustees for
        the University of Northern Colorado and Iliff School of Theology.&amp;#160; She also serves
        as president of the Little Rock Nine Foundation and is a member of the Denver Chapter of The
        Links, Incorporated, and the Johnson Legacy, Inc. Board of Directors.</p>
       <p>In addition to the NAACP&amp;#8217;s Spingarn Medal and the Congressional Gold Medal,
        awarded to her as a member of the Little Rock Nine, Mrs. LaNier is the recipient of an
        Honorary Doctorate of Humane Letters from the University of Northern Colorado and an
        inductee in the Colorado Woman&amp;#8217;s Hall of Fame and the Girl Scouts Women of
        Distinction.</p>
       <p>After working for the YWCA, Mrs. LaNier has pursued a successful career as a real estate
        broker for more than 30 years and founded her own real estate brokerage firm, LaNier and
        Company, which she currently operates, with her son Whitney.&amp;#160; In addition to her
        son, she and husband, Ira, have an adult daughter, Brooke.&amp;#160; The family lives in
        Englewood, Colorado.</p>
       <p>A sought-after lecturer, Mrs. LaNier speaks across the country and is on a promotional
        tour of her first book, A Mighty Long Way: My Journey to Justice of Little Rock Central High
        School.&amp;#160; Fans around the world have heavily anticipated the release of this
        gripping memoir from the youngest of the "Little Rock Nine", which offers an inside look at
        the most famous school integration in American history, and the courage and faith required
        to survive it all.</p>

         <em>The Evergreen State College Featured in the Princeton Review Book, "The Best 377
          Colleges" - 2013 Edition</em>
        </strong>
       </p>
       <p>The Evergreen State College is one of the country's best institutions for undergraduate
        education, according to The Princeton Review. The education services company features the
        school in the new 2013 edition of its annual college guide, "The Best 377 Colleges."</p>
       <p>Only about 15 percent of America&amp;#8217;s 2,500 four-year colleges are profiled in the
        book, which is The Princeton Review's flagship college guide. It includes detailed profiles
        of the colleges with rating scores for all schools in eight categories.</p>
       <p>Says Robert Franek, Princeton Review's Senior VP / Publisher and author of "The Best 377
        Colleges," "We commend Evergreen for its outstanding academics, which is the primary
        criteria for our selection of schools for the book.&amp;#160; Our choices are based on
        institutional data we collect about schools, our visits to schools over the years, feedback
        we gather from students attending the schools, and the opinions of our staff and our
        30-member National College Counselor Advisory Board.&amp;#160; We also work to keep a wide
        representation of colleges in the book by region, size, selectivity and
        character."&amp;#160;</p>

        <strong>(Olympia, Wash.) What&amp;#8217;s the connection between Olympia and the
         construction of the 1776-foot tall One World Trade Center building at Ground Zero in New
         York? You might be surprised (and you&amp;#8217;ll find out if you read on).</strong>

         /></a>"We all have our perspective on what's not working, whether the topic is politics,
        media, the environment, or the economy," says Michael Zimmerman, Evergreen's academic vice
        president and provost. "The newest Evergreen Magazine offers a different focus. It
        highlights what is working and tells the stories of people with ties to Olympia &amp;#8212;
        Greeners with inspiring stories, who simply make the world better."</p>
       <p>The magazine celebrates <a href="site://evergreen.edu/evergreen.edu/40/home">40 years of
         The Evergreen State College</a> and includes profiles of leaders with Olympia connections,
        including Evergreen alumni at the National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration, The Nature
        Conservancy, The Washington State Court of Appeals, and the US Agency for International
        Development, among others.</p>
       <p>Ranging from business and non-profit innovators to environmental, health and civil rights
        advocates, the magazine highlights some of the contributions of the 40,000 alumni of The
        Evergreen State College.</p>
       <p>
        <strong>The stories can be found online at <a
          href="site://evergreen.edu/evergreen.edu/magazine/home"
         >www.evergreen.edu/magazine</a>.</strong>
       </p>
       <p>One of the stories is about Dan Tishman of Tishman Construction (Evergreen Class of 1977),
        the construction managers for One World Trade Center as well as WTC Towers 3 and 4 and a
        host of other iconic projects in the United States and around the world. Tishman also chairs
        the board of trustees of the Natural Resources Defense Council and has become an
        international leader in green building.</p>
       <p>"Liberal arts education develops the ability to think critically, act creatively, and
        integrate information from many perspectives," says Zimmerman. "This is what a rapidly
        changing world requires, and the Evergreen alumni featured in our latest magazine are
        putting those capabilities to work in amazing ways."</p>
       <p>Past issues of the Evergreen Magazine focused on themes including business and
        entrepreneurship, science and medicine, food, media and technology, politics and public
        service, the environment, and more. These are also available online at <a

       <h2>Application by Evergreen and Squaxin Island Tribe to Rename &amp;#8220;Squaw
        Point&amp;#8221; to &amp;#8220;Bushoowah-ahlee Point&amp;#8221; approved by the US Board of
        Geographic Names</h2>
       <p>Members of an Evergreen &amp;#8216;Name Change Committee&amp;#8217; recently announced
        that the US Board of Geographic Names has approved the name change of &amp;#8220;Squaw
        Point&amp;#8221; on the Eld Inlet beach of The Evergreen State College to the ancestral
        indigenous name: &amp;#8220;Bushoowah-ahlee Point.&amp;#8221;</p>
       <p>The name &amp;#8220;Bushoowah-ahlee Point&amp;#8221; was requested in a joint application
        by The Evergreen State College and the Squaxin Island Tribe to identify the northernmost
        point of the campus.</p>
       <p>The beach sits on a cape on the property of the college (by the Geoduck House). The
        Evergreen State College, including Bushoowah-ahlee Point, is part of the land base that was
        ceded by the Medicine Creek Treaty Tribes in 1854. The location for Bushoowah-ahlee Point
        has long been recognized as a meeting place for the Coast Salish people living on the
        southern inlets of the Salish Sea.</p>
       <p>&amp;#8220;We changed this place name both out of respect for Native women, and out of
        respect for the language that has been spoken on this land since long before our state or
        campus was founded,&amp;#8221; says Art Costantino, chair of the &amp;#8216;Name Change
        Committee&amp;#8217; and vice president for student affairs at Evergreen.</p>
       <p>The effort to rename the point began during fall 2009 when a group of staff were reviewing
        maps of the campus for hazard mitigation purposes. Members of the Evergreen staff were
        surprised to see that a portion of the college's property on Eld Inlet was designated as
        "Squaw Point."</p>
       <h3>Wrong term, wrong region</h3>
       <p>While the roots of the term &amp;#8220;squaw&amp;#8221; lie in the Algonquin language on
        the East Coast, it has evolved to take on a more derogatory meaning that is not an
        appropriate reference for indigenous women.</p>
       <p>With the support of the college, a group of faculty, staff and students has been meeting
        to initiate a change in the name. The group includes <a
         href="http://www.evergreen.edu/longhouse/home.htm">Longhouse</a> staff,
        Evergreen&amp;#8217;s <a href="http://www.evergreen.edu/multicultural/studentactivities.htm"
         >First Peoples' Advising Services</a>, and students, staff and faculty.</p>
       <p>Specifically, &amp;#8216;Name Change Committee&amp;#8217; members included Chair and Vice
        President for Student Affairs, Art Costantino; Longhouse Staff Members Tina Kuckkahn-Miller
        and Laura Grabhorn; faculty members Frances Rains and Zoltan Grossman; Raquel Salinas of
        First Peoples Advising Services; students Derek Jones and Shonri Begay, and College
        Engineer, Rich Davis.</p>
       <h3>A process of consultation and research</h3>
       <p>The group consulted with the Squaxin Island Tribe, who historically owned the land, and
        with whom Evergreen has a long-standing and valued positive relationship.</p>
       <p>The State of Washington encourages state agencies to work directly with tribes -- on
        issues such as this name change -- as part of the 1989 Centennial Accord and the 1999 New
        Millennium Agreement, which encourage government-to-government collaborative actions that
        benefit both entities. Evergreen honors these government to government relationships
        established by the Centennial Accord and affirmed by the Millennium Agreement (see <a
         href="http://www.goia.wa.gov">www.goia.wa.gov</a>) through its partnership with the Squaxin
        Island Tribe.</p>
       <p>Squaxin Island appointed Lushootseed language scholar Zalmai Zahir to research the
        ancestral name of the area. Mr. Zahir had worked for many years with the late Vi Hilbert
        (Upper Skagit) who was the region&amp;#8217;s primary Lushootseed language expert and
        scholar on indigenous place names of the region around the Salish Sea.</p>
       <p>Mr. Zahir documented the original place name in Thomas Talbot Waterman&amp;#8217;s 1922
        book Puget Sound Geography. Waterman was an anthropologist who was most interested in
        recording Native languages and cultures and depicting how those languages appeared
        phonetically. He traveled widely in the area and among the many things he collected, he also
        collected geographic names. A recent reproduction (by Vi Hilbert, Jay Miller, and Zalmai
        Zahir) contains Waterman&amp;#8217;s original manuscript. T.T. Waterman lists the name of
        the point as B1cuwa'3ali, (1= uh, c=sh, and 3= glottal stop in his orthography).</p>
       <p>The name Bushoowah-ahlee is very old and there isn't a comparable English translation. The
        Squaxin Island Tribe has requested that the phonetic spelling of the name in the Roman
        alphabet be officially adopted, rather than the Lushootseed alphabet. The ancestral name,
        Bushoowah-ahlee Point serves as a reminder of the history of this place that goes much
        further back in time than the mid-nineteenth century and offers a the chance to appreciate
        the area as it was originally known.</p>
       <h3>Community Recognition; Official Recognition</h3>
       <p>As of September 15, 2011, the US Board on Geographic Names recognized the beach officially
        by its original name. Bushoowah-ahlee Point is now in the USBGN's Geographic Names
        Information System (GNIS). At the Washington State level, Caleb Maki of the Washington Board
        on Geographic Names has directed the Washington DNR cartography office to change Squaw Point
        to Bushoowah-ahlee Point on any new state maps.</p>
       <p>The change is automatic on all federal maps, according to a geographer on the faculty,
        Zoltan Grossman.</p>
       <p>The name change enjoyed tremendous support from the Evergreen community. Students working
        with First People&amp;#8217;s Advising gathered some 300 letters of support from students,
        staff and faculty for the name change.</p>
       <p>Evergreen&amp;#8217;s Board of Trustees also offered its support for the change, and a
        Geoduck Student Union initiative was backed by 87 percent of students in the Spring 2010
        election.</p>
       <p>Next spring, there will be a celebration to mark the official name change, to coincide
        with the campus&amp;#8217;s <a
         href="http://www.evergreen.edu/multicultural/dayofabsencepresence.htm">Day of Absence/Day
         of Presence</a> events and the official start of the Salish New Year.</p>

       <h2>Annual Community to Community Action Day- Day of Caring event will put hundreds of
        volunteers to work</h2>
       <p>Day of Caring, the largest annual one-day volunteer event in Thurston County, is this
        Friday, September 23. Over 500 volunteers from throughout Thurston County, including 150 new
        students from The Evergreen State College, will be working on 35 projects throughout the
        county.</p>
       <p>Projects include organizing donated books, assembling bags of food, harvesting fall
        vegetables, helping get farms ready for the winter season, painting homes that houses
        disabled individuals, lending a hand with a carnival and field day for school kids, and many
        other activities.</p>
       <p>Day of Caring helps local nonprofits by providing an opportunity to get tasks accomplished
        that would otherwise take time away from their primary purpose of serving their clients. For
        volunteers, the event is a way to meet new people, work as a team and gain new experiences,
        while helping improve their community. Day of Caring is also the official kick-off of United
        Way&amp;#8217;s annual fundraising campaign. This year's goal is to raise $1.4 million for
        local health and human service programs.</p>
       <p>&amp;#8220;For 19 years, United Way and our partners have been organizing the Day of
        Caring to support good work right here in Thurston County,&amp;#8221; shared Paul Knox,
        United Way&amp;#8217;s Executive Director. &amp;#8220;At the end of the day, imagine the
        impact from those hundreds of volunteers on our community &amp;#8211; it&amp;#8217;s
        incredible!&amp;#8221;</p>
       <p>Day of Caring is generously sponsored by Bron&amp;#8217;s Automotive, Heritage Bank, O Bee
        Credit Union, Olympia Federal Savings, Providence St. Peter Hospital, Target, and TwinStar

       <h2>Campus Efforts to Create a Welcoming Environment for Veterans Recognized</h2>
       <p>The 2012 Military Friendly Schools list honors the top 20 percent of colleges,
        universities and trade schools that are doing the most to embrace America&amp;#8217;s
        military service members and veterans as students.</p>
       <p>In its effort to help student veterans find the right school, G.I. Jobs incorporated a
        survey of student veterans for the first time. This feedback provides prospective military
        students with insight into the student veteran experience at a particular institution based
        on peer reviews from current students. Student veteran survey feedback can be viewed at <a
         href="http://www.militaryfriendlyschools.com">www.militaryfriendlyschools.com/2012</a>
        list.</p>
       <h3>Innovations in Policy and Practice at Evergreen</h3>
       <p>Evergreen is becoming widely recognized as a leader in working to provide a supportive and
        welcoming environment for student veterans.</p>
       <ul>
        <li>Evergreen has an established Veterans Support Working Group made up of students, staff
         and faculty -- and a Student Veteran Organization.</li>
        <li>The Evergreen State College organized the first ever regional higher education summit on
         veterans&amp;#8217; needs, experiences and retention. War and the Soul: Creating Healing
         Academic Communities for Our Nation&amp;#8217;s Veterans</li>
        <li>Annual events include a Fall Quarter Veterans Reception in which a Veterans Medallion is
         presented to all identified incoming veterans in recognition of their service, a tradition
         of celebration of Veterans Day for the past 17 years, and Memorial Day recognition efforts
         including distribution of thousands of Memorial Day poppies.</li>
        <li>Evergreen also aims to attract veterans and their dependents through recruitment
         efforts, outreach and tuition waivers year round for qualifying veterans and
         veterans&amp;#8217; dependents.</li>
       </ul>
       <p>The 1,518 colleges, universities and trade schools on this year&amp;#8217;s list
        prioritize the recruitment of students with military experience. These schools are making
        the grade by offering scholarships and discounts, veterans&amp;#8217; clubs, full-time
        staff, military credit and other services to those who served. The 2012 list of Military
        Friendly Schools &amp;#174; was compiled through a survey of more than 8,000 schools
        nationwide. Methodology, criteria and weighting for the list were developed with the
        assistance of an Academic Advisory Board (AAB) consisting of educators from schools across
        the country. A full list of board members can be found at <a
         href="http://militaryfriendlyschools.com/Article/advisory-board/"
         >http://militaryfriendlyschools.com/Article/advisory-board/</a>.</p>
       <p>A detailed list of Military Friendly Schools &amp;#174; is highlighted in the annual Guide
        to Military Friendly Schools and on a poster, both of which will be distributed to hundreds
        of thousands of active and former military personnel in early October. The website, found at
         <a href="http://www.militaryfriendlyschools.com">www.militaryfriendlyschools.com</a>,
        features the list, interactive tools and search functionality to assist military veterans
        with their school decisions.</p>
       <h3>About G.I. Jobs<a href="http://www.gijobs.com"/></h3>
       <p><a href="http://www.gijobs.com">G.I. Jobs</a> is published by Victory Media, a

       <h3>About Kenji Yoshino</h3>
       <p>A renowned legal scholar, Yoshino's first book, Covering, was acclaimed&amp;#8211;from the

        its elegant prose, its good humor, and its brilliant insights into civil rights and
        discrimination law.</p>
       <p>Yoshino&amp;#8217;s provocative new book, A Thousand Times More Fair: What
        Shakespeare&amp;#8217;s Plays Teach Us About Justice addresses fundamental questions we ask
        about our world today: Why is the rule of law better than revenge? How much mercy should we
        show a wrongdoer? What does it mean to "prove" guilt or innocence? As Yoshino argues, a
        searching examination of Shakespeare's plays&amp;#8211;and the many advocates, judges,
        criminals, and vigilantes who populate them&amp;#8211;can elucidate some of the most
        troubling issues in contemporary life.</p>
       <p>With a great ear for Shakespeare and an eye trained steadily on current affairs, Yoshino
        considers how competing models of judging presented in Measure for Measure resurfaced around
        the confirmation hearings for Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor; how the revenge cycle
        of Titus Andronicus illuminates the "war on terror" and our military engagements in
        Afghanistan and Iraq; how the white handkerchief in Othello and the black glove in the O. J.
        Simpson trial reflect forms of proof that overwhelm all other evidence; and how the
        spectacle of an omnipotent ruler voluntarily surrendering power in The Tempest, as
        Cincinnatus did before him and George Washington did after him, informs regime change in our
        own time.</p>
       <h3>About the Daniel J. Evans Chair in Liberal Arts</h3>
       <p>Support for this event is provided by endowment funds of The Daniel J. Evans Chair in
        Liberal Arts. Funded by a state grant and matching donations from many generous people, The
        Daniel J. Evans Chair in Liberal Arts was established in 1991 to enrich academic programs
        and intensively support entry level classes (Core programs). This endowment honors and pays
        tribute to Daniel Evans &amp;#8211; Washington State legislator, U.S. Senator, Governor of
        Washington State, past president of The Evergreen State College, and a nationally respected
        statesman. The Chair allows distinguished scholars to work with Evergreen&amp;#8217;s newest
        students, thereby exposing them to the best possible minds at an early stage in their
        academic careers.</p>

       <h2>The Evergreen State College named one of America&amp;#8217;s Top 20
        &amp;#8220;Coolest&amp;#8221; Schools by Sierra Magazine</h2>
       <h3>Evergreen praised for green efforts by national magazine, ranks 9 on list</h3>
       <p>The Evergreen State College placed ninth on Sierra magazine&amp;#8217;s fifth annual
        ranking of the nation&amp;#8217;s top &amp;#8220;Coolest Schools.&amp;#8221; A salute to the
        efforts of colleges around the country helping to solve climate issues and operate
        sustainably, the cover feature spotlights the schools that are making a true impact for the
        planet, from UC Irvine&amp;#8217;s energy-efficiency standards to Stanford&amp;#8217;s
        commitment to maintaining undeveloped open space to Green Mountain College sourcing nearly
        half its energy from, yes, cow manure. The complete list is available online at
        www.sierramagazine.com /coolschools.</p>
       <p>Sustainability initiatives at Evergreen include efforts to reduce waste, conserve energy,
        achieve climate neutrality, as well as the college&amp;#8217;s work to provide learning
        resources through its salmon-safe certified organic farm, its distinct commitment to
        sustainability in the classroom, and sustainable living and food choice options in which
        students consciously choose a better way to relate to their natural world.</p>
       <p>&amp;#8220;When students take what they&amp;#8217;ve learned in the classroom and proceed
        to get their hands dirty in the real world, they realize the potential they have to make a
        difference,&amp;#8221; said Bob Sipchen, Sierra magazine editor-in-chief.
        &amp;#8220;We&amp;#8217;re thrilled to highlight these forward-thinking schools for
        emphasizing environmental responsibility, and for teaching, inspiring, and empowering
        students to affect real change.&amp;#8221;</p>
       <p>This year&amp;#8217;s top schools prove that schools of all sizes &amp;#8211; the
        University of Washington has 40,000 students, while College of the Atlantic has 321
        &amp;#8211; are taking dramatic action to help preserve the planet and its resources.</p>
       <h3>Sierra magazine&amp;#8217;s top 20 schools of 2011 are:</h3>
       <ol>
        <li>University of Washington (Seattle, WA)</li>
        <li>Green Mountain College (Poultney, VT)</li>
        <li>University of California San Diego (San Diego, CA)</li>
        <li>Warren Wilson College (Asheville, NC)</li>
        <li>Stanford University (Stanford, CA)</li>
        <li>University of California, Irvine (Irvine, CA)</li>
        <li>University of California, Santa Cruz (Santa Cruz, CA)</li>
        <li>University of California, Davis (Davis, CA)</li>
        <li>The Evergreen State College (Olympia, WA)</li>
        <li>Middlebury College (Middlebury, VT)</li>
        <li>University of New Hampshire (Durham, NJ)</li>
        <li>Appalachian State University (Boone, NC)</li>
        <li>Colby College (Waterville, ME)</li>
        <li>Western Washington University (Bellingham, WA)</li>
        <li>University of California, Los Angeles (Los Angeles, CA)</li>

        <li>Clark University (Worcester, MA)</li>
        <li>Cornell University (Ithaca, NY)</li>
        <li>Bowdoin College (Brunswick, ME)</li>
        <li>University of Maryland (College Park, MD)</li>
       </ol>
       <p>Sierra also featured the stories of educators and students who are committed to immersive
        learning, and who take their lessons outside the confines of the classroom and into the real
        world, to places like Bali in Indonesia, New York&amp;#8217;s Adirondack Mountains, and
        Utah&amp;#8217;s Navajo Nation.</p>
       <p>According to a 2010 Princeton Review report, 64% of prospective college students take a
        university's commitment to environmental issues into consideration when deciding where to
        apply and enroll. Students care deeply about green issues and are attracted to institutions
        that are taking the initiative to solve environmental problems. The complete rankings, with
        comprehensive descriptions of each school&amp;#8217;s environmental efforts, are available
        online at <a href="http://www.sierramagazine.com/coolschools"
         >www.sierramagazine.com/coolschools</a>.</p>

        we gather from students attending the schools, and the opinions of our staff and our
        28-member National College Counselor Advisory Board. We also work to keep a wide
        representation of colleges in the book by region, size, selectivity and character."</p>

        event in the Northwest, will be returning to the Washington State History Museum on
         <strong>Aug. 6 from 10 a.m. to 7 p.m.</strong> As the exciting focal point of the In the
        Spirit exhibit, the free outdoor event offers visitors an unparalleled opportunity to

        Director of the Washington State Historical Society that runs the museum. &amp;#8220;Over
        the last several months visitors to the museum have been asked to vote on their favorite
        piece of art and we&amp;#8217;ll announce the artist that came out on top during the
        festival.&amp;#8221;</p>
       <p>The fun, educational and interactive In the Spirit event features performances by local
        Native American dancers, musicians and storytellers in the museum&amp;#8217;s 300-seat
        outdoor amphitheater. In the plaza, adjacent to the amphitheater, some of the Pacific
        Northwest&amp;#8217;s most talented artisans, including weavers, printmakers, carvers and
        bead artists, will be selling their colorful wares, including native clothing and jewelry,
        and offering live art demonstrations.</p>
       <p>Stand out artists at the market include Shaun Peterson, creator of the &amp;#8220;Welcome
        Figure Project&amp;#8221; in downtown Tacoma, Peter Boome winner of all three awards in the

       <h2>Dr. Russ Genet to Trace Humanity&amp;#8217;s Discovery of the Cosmos on August 3</h2>
       <h3>Evening Star Hunt to Follow Free Public Lecture by Distinguished Astronomer</h3>
       <p>In a colorful slide presentation and lecture, astronomer and noetic scientist Russ Genet
        will trace humanity&amp;#8217;s discovery of the cosmos beginning with pre-scientific
        cosmologies and culminating in the Big Bang Theory and the Runaway Universe. The lecture,
        beginning at 7 p.m., concludes with a summary of our current search for exoplanets and our
        quest to find life and alien civilizations among the stars.</p>
       <p>The presentation is free and open to the public and takes place from 7 p.m. until 9 p.m.
        at The Evergreen State College Campus (in the Longhouse). The cost for parking is $2.
        Weather permitting, the lecture will be followed by an exploration of the evening sky in a
        star hunt.</p>
       <p>Genet tells the story of the evolution of human consciousness, from primeval stardust to
        planetary stardom, and explores the emergence of the story through scientific research and
        wonder. He views the multi-faceted epic through unexpected lenses, and follows it through
        education. Finally, he explores the evolutionary epic as it shifts cultural and scientific
        paradigms, serves our quest for a brighter future, and enriches humanity&amp;#8217;s
        imaginative and spiritual dimensions.</p>
       <p>Evergreen students will also be making presentations on their published research into
        binary stars on August 3.</p>
       <p>Genet&amp;#8217;s presentation is part of the <a
         href="site://evergreen.edu/news/archives/2011/07/noeticslectures">Cosmology and
         Consciousness &amp;#8212; Summer Lecture Series (</a><a href="##">schedule of events)</a>.

       <h2>The Evergreen State College Receives $3,000,000 Grant to Promote Retention of At-Risk
        Students and to Support Student Scholarships</h2>
       <p>The Evergreen State College has been awarded a grant of $3 million in June to support
        retention of students, build capacity for fundraising to support student scholarships and
        other critical needs, and create an endowed scholarship fund for low-income students at risk
        of failing to complete their degrees.</p>
       <h3>The multi-year grant from the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation will:</h3>
       <ul>
        <li>Establish an endowed scholarship fund that will increase support for low-income students
         that are at risk of dropping out of college ($1,500,000);</li>
        <li>Support creative approaches to curricular development and academic and career advising
         that will facilitate student retention and success ($250,000); and</li>
        <li>Provide funding to increase Evergreen&amp;#8217;s capacity to attract new benefactors
         supporting scholarships and other needs on campus as the college gears up to celebrate 40
         years of teaching and learning in 2011-2012 ($1,250,000.)</li>
       </ul>
       <p>Evergreen has a long tradition of serving a diverse population of students, including many
        that are the first in their families to attend college and many in financial distress or
        with few economic resources.</p>
       <p>The grant will endow a scholarship fund that will support students in perpetuity as well

        lives. In developing countries, it focuses on improving people&amp;#8217;s health and giving
        them the chance to lift themselves out of hunger and extreme poverty. In the United States,
        it seeks to ensure that all people&amp;#8212;especially those with the fewest
        resources&amp;#8212;have access to the opportunities they need to succeed in school and
        life.</p>

        explained Les Purce, president of The Evergreen State College. &amp;#8220;This investment
        represents a vote of confidence in Evergreen's nationally recognized model for teaching and
        learning and its ongoing work to support students from the widest range of backgrounds in
        completing their degrees today, tomorrow and long into the future. The Gates Foundation is a
        mindful, deliberate investor in creating positive change in the world and we are delighted

       <h2>Squaxin Island Tribe and The Evergreen State College Longhouse Receive $100,000
        &amp;#8220;Our Town&amp;#8221; Grant From the National Endowment for the Arts</h2>
       <h3>The project &amp;#8216;Our Tribe: The People of The Water&amp;#8217; was awarded one of
        only 51 grants nationwide in support of &amp;#8220;creative placemaking&amp;#8221;</h3>
       <p>(Olympia, Wash.) Today, the Squaxin Island Tribe and The Evergreen State College Longhouse
        Education and Cultural Center announced that they will receive an Our Town grant from the
        National Endowment for the Arts (NEA). The tribe and the college will receive a grant of
        $100,000 in support of Native art in conjunction with the 2012 annual canoe journey on the
        Salish Sea (Puget Sound).</p>
       <p>The NEA grant will help provide for documentation, installation, and exhibition for the
        project, <em>Our Tribe: The People of the Water,</em> a partnership of the Longhouse and the
        Squaxin Island Museum.</p>
       <p>Project participant artists will create works to further establish a sense of Squaxin
        Island tribal identity, people and place. Established artists will teach their art forms to
        an intergenerational group of emerging artists and will create art to establish identity of
        people and place during the Tribal Journey canoe event.</p>
       <p>At the project conclusion in summer 2012, the Squaxin Tribe will maintain the art pieces
        in the community and share them with neighboring townships for exhibition. The Museum and
        Longhouse will continue to host residencies with private and tribal funding.</p>
       <p><em>Our Town</em> is the NEA&amp;#8217;s latest investment in &amp;#8220;creative
        placemaking,&amp;#8221; through which partners from both public and private sectors come
        together to strategically shape the social, physical, and economic character of a
        neighborhood, town, city, or region around arts and cultural activities.</p>
       <p>The NEA grant will support half of the total project cost of $200,000. Longhouse and
        Squaxin Island Museum staff support and facility use provide the other half.</p>
       <p>Expected project outcomes include increasing the number of practicing Squaxin artists,
        expanding indigenous artist networks, and increasing art appreciation, cultural tourism and
        economic development.</p>
       <p>National Endowment for the Arts Chairman Rocco Landesman said, &amp;#8220;Communities
        across our country are using smart design and leveraging the arts to enhance quality of life
        and promote their distinctive identities. In this time of great economic upheaval, Our Town
        provides communities an opportunity to reignite their economies.&amp;#8221;</p>
       <p>&amp;#8220;This is a significant year for Evergreen and the Longhouse,&amp;#8221; said
        Tina Kuckkahn, director of the Longhouse Education and Cultural Center at Evergreen.
        &amp;#8220;The Longhouse is celebrating its 15th year and with the upcoming 2011-12 academic
        year, the college is marking its 40th anniversary, celebrating four decades of innovative
        teaching and learning.&amp;#8221;</p>
       <p>&amp;#8220;The Our Town Grant from the NEA is another extraordinary example of the
        important national role and creative partnerships The Evergreen State College and its
        Longhouse have developed over the years,&amp;#8221; said Kuckkahn. &amp;#8220;We are pleased
        that this project gives the Longhouse an opportunity to build on and strengthen the
        long-term partnership that Evergreen has enjoyed with the Squaxin Island Tribe over the
        years. We always remember how strongly members of the Squaxin Island Tribe supported the
        dream of a Longhouse on the campus at Evergreen.&amp;#8221;</p>
       <p>&amp;#8220;The Squaxin Island Tribe will host the 2012 Canoe Journeys, one of the largest
        tribal gatherings in the Pacific Northwest. Over a hundred cedar canoes will be coming into
        the marine waters within a mile of the state capitol, the celebration of traditional native
        songs will be heard and add a unique cultural value to the city of Olympia,&amp;#8221; said
        Charlene Krise, executive director of Squaxin Tribe Museum Library Research Center.</p>
       <p>&amp;#8220;In tribal artwork are identifiable connections to the natural resources of the
        land, water and to the animal nations. It is wonderful NEA recognizes the cultural value of
        collaborative partnerships between Squaxin Island Tribe, City of Olympia and The Evergreen
        State College in our sincere attempt to enhance the quality of life by showcasing tribal
        art,&amp;#8221; Krise added.</p>
       <p class="details"><strong>The Longhouse Education and Cultural Center</strong> opened on the
        Olympia campus of The Evergreen State College in 1995. The Center&amp;#8217;s primary public
        service work is to promote indigenous arts and culture. In the beginning, the center focused
        on six local Puget Sound tribes and their artists; today staff work with indigenous artists
        throughout the Pacific Northwest region, nationally, and with other Pacific Rim indigenous
        peoples to promote indigenous arts and cultures through a wide variety of programs.</p>
       <p class="details">&amp;#160;</p>
       <p class="details"><strong>The Squaxin Island Museum Library and Research Center
         (MLRC)</strong> tells the story of the People of the Water through a series of exhibits and
        displays depicting the relationship between Squaxin Island Tribal members and the seven
        inlets of South Puget Sound. Visitors experience the rich culture of the Squaxin Island
        Tribe by participating in cultural activities and special events. The hopes and dreams of
        Squaxin elders and those who have walked before us have come true through this magnificent
        facility. Squaxin Island culture, past and present, is preserved for people of all
        generations. With a small, yet highly professional staff, the MLRC presents exhibits,
        lectures, films, tours, traditional skills workshops and educational outreach programs for
        students in local schools.</p>
       <p class="details">&amp;#160;</p>
       <p class="details"><strong>The National Endowment for the Arts</strong> was established by
        Congress in 1965 as an independent agency of the federal government. To date, the NEA has
        awarded more than $4 billion to support artistic excellence, creativity, and innovation for
        the benefit of individuals and communities. The NEA extends its work through partnerships
        with state arts agencies, local leaders, other federal agencies, and the philanthropic
        sector</p>

       <h2>Peninsula College and The Evergreen State College Announce a New Higher Education Option
        for Native Students on the Olympic Peninsula</h2>
       <h3>College Partnership to Enhance Education for Tribal Communities on the North Olympic
        Peninsula</h3>
       <p>Building on Evergreen's twenty-year history of providing higher education opportunity and
        access through its Reservation Based Community Determined Program in Western Washington,
        Peninsula College and Evergreen recently announced a new partnership to serve prospective
        student populations from all five Tribes on the North Olympic Peninsula including the Hoh,
        Quileute, Makah, Jamestown S'Klallam, and the Lower Elwha Klallam Tribes.</p>
       <p>In an effort to serve smaller and often more isolated Native communities, the Higher
        Education Coordinating Board of Washington and Evergreen's Board of Trustees recently
        approved aggregating services for students pursuing college degrees from several tribes at a
        central location. Peninsula has agreed to host The Evergreen State College Reservation Based
        Community Determined Program at the Longhouse "House of Learning" on the Peninsula College
        campus.</p>
       <p>The program provides the same curriculum and structure as the other five reservation based
        sites that are currently active in Quinault; Muckleshoot; Nisqually; Tulalip; and Port
        Gamble S'Klallam.</p>
       <p>The move derived from discussions with Peninsula College's Tribal Education Partner
        representatives and individual council representatives. The goal of the partnership is to
        create a Bachelor's degree cohort of 12 upper division (juniors and seniors) students to
        begin in the Fall of 2011.</p>
       <p>Peninsula College will begin the Reservation Based Associate of Arts (AA) Degree Bridge
        Program in Fall of 2012, which will serve first-and second-year Peninsula College students
        through a combination of on-line and face-to-face classes. The AA degree will be tailored
        for transfer of credits into the upper division of the Reservation Based Community
        Determined Program or direct transfer to other institutions around Washington.</p>
       <p>Peninsula College and The Evergreen State College are in the process of visiting Tribal
        Council representatives and tribal education department representatives on the North Olympic
        Peninsula to provide more information about these programs.</p>

        Newman as Director of Recreation and Athletics. He will take over for Wendy Endress, who has
        served as Interim Director of Recreation and Athletics since November 2010 and will be
        returning to her permanent position as Executive Associate to the Vice President of Student
        Affairs.</p>
       <p>"For all of the right reasons, Evergreen offers a broad-based Recreation and Athletics
        program in an effort to provide positive and healthy opportunities for students, faculty and
        staff, alumni, and the community," said Newman. "This fits with my philosophy about the role
        of athletics in higher education, and I couldn't be more honored and excited to become part
        of the Evergreen team."</p>
       <p>Newman comes to Evergreen following three years as commissioner of the NCAA Division III
        Northwest Conference, where he planned and oversaw operations for the 18-sport and
        3,600-student-athlete league.</p>
       <p>"I am excited to have Matt join us," said Vice President of Student Affairs Art
        Costantino. "He has experience in all aspects of the job, a reputation as a strong
        administrator and a real interest in working at Evergreen.</p>
       <p>Prior to the Northwest Conference, Newman was Associate Dean of Students and Director of
        Athletics and Recreation at Cazenovia College in Cazenovia, N.Y. Newman also has athletic
        administrative experience at Indiana University-Purdue University Fort Wayne and Savannah
        College of Art and Design and has coached at both the high school and collegiate levels,
        including six years as a collegiate baseball head coach in both the NAIA and NCAA.</p>
       <p>Newman has worked extensively with both the NAIA and NCAA and their respective committees,
        including Committee on Women's Athletics, Student Records Review Committee and Regional
        Advisory Committees for both baseball and golf.</p>
       <p>A 1990 graduate of University of Arizona with a Bachelor of Science in speech and hearing
        science, Newman also holds a Master of Science from Idaho State University and is in the
        final stages of his Doctor of Education coursework at University of Virginia.</p>
       <p>Newman, and his partner Monica Nixon, who is currently the Director of Multicultural
        Affairs at Seattle University, reside in Seattle.</p>

        an immigrant and the need for reform to ensure that America actualizes a commitment to both
        liberty and justice.</p>
       <p>The event celebrating Tacoma&amp;#8217;s Evergreen graduates will take place on June 11 at
        1 PM at the Tacoma campus of The Evergreen State College, 1210 6th Avenue, Tacoma.&amp;#160;
        The event is free and open to the public.</p>
       <p>&amp;#8220;The individual is slowly taking control of his or her destiny in many
        spheres,&amp;#8221; says Phillips.&amp;#160; &amp;#8220;This process is systematic and
        irreversible, but, as this happens, we must ensure that the inequalities in our society are
        reduced not increased.&amp;#8221;</p>
       <p>Phillips is chairman of the independent non-profit Russell 20-20 Association.</p>
       <p>He retired from Russell Investment Group after serving as Chief Executive Officer from
        1993 to 2003.&amp;#160; Under Phillips leadership, Russell Investment Group was awarded
        Washington CEO magazine&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8220;Best Companies to Work for in Washington
        State, and was among Fortune magazine&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8220;100 Best Companies to Work for
        in America.&amp;#8221;</p>
       <p>Phillips graduated with honors in law from University College, London. He is a board
        member of the Tacoma Youth Chorus, the Harold LeMay museum, and on the advisory board of the
        University of Washington, Tacoma.</p>

      <body>
       <p>How do you translate the language of ecosystem ecology biology into words that four-year
        olds, senior citizens, and incarcerated men and women can not only comprehend, but also be
        excited about? Is it possible to spark their interests and intellects in a subject that
        seems so far removed from their daily lives? These types of questions shape the work of
        scientists trying to move their research beyond their field in academia and out to the
        general public.</p>
       <p>The "Research Ambassador Program" is trying to answer these questions by approaching these
        issues from a perspective of "cross-cultural exchange." In the case of the toddlers, a
        marine biologist visited the Evergreen Campus Children's Center and talked about mud. A
        forest ecologist gave a lecture about bark beetles and forest dynamics to a group of female
        inmates at a minimum security prison, ending with a rendition of "I will survive" to signify
        the resilience of both forests and people.</p>
       <p>These biologists were recruited, trained, and rewarded to be "Research Ambassadors",
        prepared to interact with and bring science directly to both traditional and underserved
        segments of the public.</p>
       <p>In 2010, Dr. Nalini Nadkarni, faculty member at The Evergreen State College, received
        funding from the National Science Foundation to initiate the Research Ambassador Program, a
        project to explore ways for scientists to link with members of their local communities by
        offering presentations, workshops, and other events at senior centers, churches, daycare
        centers, and other places we visit on a daily basis.</p>
       <p>Since January, 2011, the Research Ambassador Program has hosted the first seven of its
        eight scheduled visiting Fellows, which include some scientists at the beginning and others
        at later stages of their careers. They wish to learn creative ways to conduct outreach in
        their local communities during their three-day visits to Olympia. Here, they receive
        one-on-one training in communications strategies from both Dr. Nadkarni, and Amy Stasch, a
        former National Park ranger. They then apply those strategies in outreach talks later in
        their visit. Fellows have spoken at area prisons (including Stafford Creek Corrections
        Center, Washington Corrections Center for Women, and Mission Creek Corrections Center for
        Women), to the four year old "Geoducks" of the Evergreen Children's Center , at the Olympia
        Film Society, and at a workshop at United Churches. Fellows have also met individually with
        patrons and employees of the local stores Alpine Experience, Olympic Outfitters, and Wind Up
        Here toys, exploring how scientists could more actively interact with skiers, snowboarders,
        and parents. .</p>
       <p>The program has received an enthusiastic response from all involved. Participating
        scientists have returned to their home communities with action plans to contact their local
        senior centers, and the teachers at the daycare centers their children attend. Partners have
        expressed interest in hearing more about current scientific developments and appreciate the
        opportunity to interact directly with a scientist to ask questions and hear the details of
        working in a lab.</p>
       <p>In May, the program will be hosting one more visiting Fellow, Dr. Doug Levey, a Professor
        at the University of Florida who studies plant compounds. He will talk to the childcare
        center, and discuss his scientific work with prisoners. The public is invited to a public
        talk at Buck's Fifth Avenue (209 5th Ave.) in Olympia on Tuesday May 17 at 11 a.m. Amidst
        the shelves of spices, Dr. Doug Levey will explain why chilis are hot, drawing on his
        ecological and biochemical work to understand the evolutionary ecology behind plant
        production of spicy compounds that affect animals that may eat them..</p>
       <p>Program Director Nalini Nadkarni is a leading forest canopy ecologist and has been a
        member of The Evergreen State College faculty for more than 18 years. She has a passion for
        introducing new audiences to the wonder of science, and won the Public Service Award from
        the National Science Board in 2010 for her efforts.</p>

       <h2>May 26 Event to Honor America's Fallen Servicemen and Women</h2>
       <p>
        <strong>Anticipates Memorial Day; Remembers America's Casualties of War</strong>
       </p>
       <p>On Thursday, May 26, The Evergreen State College will acknowledge the American soldiers,
        airmen and women, Marines and sailors who have died in Operation Enduring Freedom, Operation
        Iraqi Freedom, and Operation New Dawn by reading their names on the college's Red Square.
        The event, entitled <em>The Readers Project: Honoring the Fallen</em> will commence at 7:30
        AM. It will continue until the name of every serviceman and woman who has been officially
        identified as a casualty (nearly 6,026 to date) has been read aloud. Readers will include
        Evergreen students, staff, and faculty, veterans, representatives of many faiths, the
        military and the community.</p>
       <p>The memorial will take place without pomp or speeches in order to simply invite the
        community to remember and honor those who have sacrificed their lives in service to our
        country, and to provide an occasion to contemplate the profound losses families and
        communities are experiencing throughout the nation.</p>
       <p>This event is being organized by The Veterans of Evergreen Transition and Success Team
        (VETS) of The Evergreen State College. The VETS Team is comprised of Evergreen staff,
        faculty and students.</p>

       <h3>Evergreen State College Masters students to discuss renewable energy challenges</h3>
       <p>OLYMPIA, Wash. (April 25, 2011) - Master of Environmental Studies students from The
        Evergreen State College in Olympia will discuss past, present, and future renewable energy
        technologies and how they affect the air, land, and sea in our region. Eco-activists Ed
        Begley, Jr. and Bryan Welch will moderate the discussion.</p>
       <p>Ed Begley, Jr., actor, activist and author, has served on the Environmental Media
        Association and the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy. His motto Live Simply So That Others

        do the same by finding environmentally friendly resources and communities.</p>
       <p>Bryan Welch is a Kansas farmer, author and the publisher of Ogden Publications , the
        largest media company serving the sustainability community. Welch will draw on ideas and
        themes from his book Beautiful and Abundant , which focuses on sustainability and its
        connection with the future of humanity. "Once the human imagination visualizes a brilliant
        future, the human intellect can achieve what previously seemed impossible," says Welch.</p>
       <p>The Fair will be held at the Puyallup Fairgrounds Saturday, June 4 from 9 a.m. to 7 p.m.,
        and Sunday, June 5 from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. Tickets are available by phone at 1-800-234-3368,

        commitments to sustainability in their academic offerings, campus infrastructure, activities

       <p>Last summer, The Princeton Review named 18 colleges to its "2011 Green Rating Honor Roll"
        - a recognition of colleges that received the highest possible score (99) in its Green
        Rating tallies. Published in "The Best 373 Colleges" guidebook, the Green Rating Honor Roll
        includes:</p>
       <p>(in alphabetical order)</p>
       <ul>
        <li>Arizona State University (Tempe)</li>
        <li>College of the Atlantic (Bar Harbor ME)</li>
        <li>The Evergreen State College (Olympia WA)</li>
        <li>Georgia Institute of Technology (Atlanta)</li>

        <li>Northeastern University (Boston MA)</li>

        <li>West Virginia University (Morgantown)</li>
        <li>Yale University (New Haven CT)</li>
       </ul>
       <p>The Princeton Review, known for its education and test-preparation services, first created
        the guide for college-bound students in 2010 in collaboration with USGBC, which is
        best-known for developing the LEED green building certification program. This past fall,
        USGBC launched its Center for Green Schools (<a href="http://www.centerforgreenschools.org"
         >www.centerforgreenschools.org</a>) to increase its efforts to drive change in how campuses
        and schools are designed, constructed and operated so that all educational facilities can
        enhance student learning experiences.</p>
       <p>"College-bound students are increasingly interested in sustainability issues," said Robert
        Franek, Senior VP, Publishing, The Princeton Review. "Among 8,200 college applicants who
        participated in our spring 2011 'College Hopes &amp; Worries Survey,' nearly 7 out of 10
        (69%) told us that having information about a school's commitment to the environment would
        influence their decision to apply to or attend the school," he added. "Together with USGBC,
        we are pleased to make this free resource available to all students seeking to attend
        colleges that practice, teach and support environmentally-responsible choices. To that end,
        we highly recommend the terrific schools in this book."</p>
       <p>"A green campus can transform the college experience for students through enhanced
        sustainability education and by creating healthy living and learning environments all while
        saving energy, water and money as part of an institution's bottom line," said Rick Fedrizzi,
        President, CEO and Founding Chair, USGBC. "We launched the Center for Green Schools at USGBC
        with a vision of green schools for all within this generation. Partnering with The Princeton
        Review to provide this invaluable resource to college-bound students was a no-brainer for
        helping to create transformational change on these campuses."</p>
       <h3>How Schools Were Chosen for the Guide to 311 Green Colleges</h3>
       <p>The Princeton Review chose the 311 schools for its Guide to 311 Green Colleges based on a
        survey it conducted in 2010 of hundreds of colleges across the U.S. and in Canada to tally
        its annual "Green Rating" scores (scaled from 60 to 99) of colleges for its school profiles
        in its college guidebooks and website. The survey asks administrators more than 50 questions
        about their institution's sustainability-related policies, practices and programs. The
        Company tallied Green Ratings for 703 institutions in summer 2010. The 311 schools in this
        guide received scores of 80 or above in that assessment. (Note: The Princeton Review does
        not rank the schools in this guide hierarchically (1 to 311) according to their Green Rating
        scores, nor does it include those scores in this book's school profiles.) Information about
        The Princeton Review's Green Rating methodology and its "Green Honor Roll" list saluting
        schools that received Green Ratings of 99 is at <a

        <strong>(Olympia, Wash.) Michael Zimmerman will be the next Academic Vice President and
         Provost at The Evergreen State College. Evergreen President Les Purce made the announcement
         Monday following the conclusion of a nationwide search.</strong>
       </p>
       <p>"Michael brings to Evergreen an extraordinarily rich background in teaching, scholarship,
        public engagement and leadership in higher education," said Purce.</p>
       <p>Zimmerman has more than 30 years of experience in public and private institutions, most
        recently at Butler University and the University of Wisconsin &amp;#8211; Oshkosh, including
        positions as dean of the colleges of arts and sciences at those institutions.</p>
       <p>He received his A.B. in geography from the University of Chicago and his PhD in biology
        from Washington University in St. Louis.</p>
       <p>"Michael brings substantial leadership skills, a passion for our public liberal arts
        mission, and a genuine interest in Evergreen's unique potential to serve students and
        society," said Purce.</p>
       <p>"I am honored to have been selected to serve the Evergreen community in this role," said
        Zimmerman. "I'm approaching the Provost's position with a great sense of excitement, fully
        aware of the unique and rich role Evergreen has played in higher education since its
        founding. I consider it a privilege to be able to work with Les Purce and the wonderful
        administrative team he has put in place, the talented faculty and staff of the college, and
        the students for whom the college exists."</p>
       <p>Zimmerman will begin work at Evergreen this summer. He succeeds Don Bantz who served as
        Evergreen's provost for six years before leaving to become the president of Alaska Pacific
        University in March 2010. Evergreen faculty member and former dean Ken Tabbutt has served as
        interim Provost.</p>

       <h2>Day of Presence</h2>
       <h3>Who's In, Who's Out?: The Current Environment for Social Justice</h3>
       <p>
        <strong>Wednesday, April 27</strong>
       </p>
       <p>Although many of us focus on issues of diversity daily, the campus community is asked to
        reflect on issues of racial diversity for two days each year when we observe the Day of
        Absence (April 22) and the Day of Presence (April 27).</p>
       <p>Our focus this year has been on issues of access such as immigration rights and reform,
        access to higher education for people of color, ethnic studies, The Dream Act, hidden
        histories and historical trauma, anti-racism skills, community activism and allyship.</p>

       <p>For coalition &amp; community-building the campus celebrates the Day of Absence by meeting
        in two different groups: An off-campus educational retreat which all of
        Evergreen&amp;#8217;s students, staff and faculty of color are invited to attend and, on
        campus our white allies offer a full day of programming around anti-oppression work from a
        different perspective.</p>
       <p>Day of Presence programming represents the reuniting of our entire community and an
        opportunity to share ideas with each other as allies around the issues of multiculturalism.
        All events are free but some may require pre-registration.</p>

       <h3>About the Rachel Carson Forum</h3>
       <p>Students in the Master of Environmental Studies program at The Evergreen State College
        started the Rachel Carson forum in 1990. The annual celebration of author and activist
        Rachel Carson&amp;#8217;s life and achievements has included speakers on climate change and
        local sustainability. Carson&amp;#8217;s work embodies what MES students are training to do
        &amp;#8211; make a difference. Carson is known for her groundbreaking 1962 book exposing the
        dangers of pesticides, &amp;#8220;Silent Spring.&amp;#8221; Her contributions played an
        integral role leading to the ban of DDT use in the United States.</p>

       <p>Rollin taught the first course ever in the world in veterinary medical ethics, which has
        been a required part of the veterinary curriculum at Colorado State University since 1978,
        and was a pioneer in reforming animal use in surgery teaching and laboratory exercises in
        veterinary colleges.</p>
       <p>Rollin has lectured extensively on animal ethics, genetic engineering, animal pain, animal
        research, animal agriculture, veterinary ethics and other topics in bioethics and philosophy
        to audiences of medical researchers, attorneys, psychologists, philosophers, veterinarians,
        animal advocates, ranchers, farmers, government officials, students and others in the United
        States., Canada, Mexico, Brazil, England, Scotland, Italy, Poland, Holland, Iceland,
        Denmark, Sweden, Belgium, France, Australia, New Zealand, Malaysia, Singapore, and South
        Africa.</p>
       <p>He is a University Distinguished Professor, Professor of Philosophy, Professor of
        Biomedical Sciences, Professor of Animal Sciences, and University Bioethicist at Colorado
        State University.</p>
       <p>Rollin is a principal architect of 1985 federal legislation dealing with the welfare of
        experimental animals, and has testified before Congress on animal experimentation. He has
        consulted for various agencies of the governments of the United States., Canada, Australia,
        the Netherlands, New Zealand, and South Africa on many aspects of animal research, for the
        Office of Technology Assessment of the U.S. Congress on genetic engineering of animals, for
        the National Institutes of Health on animal pain, and for the World Health Organization on
        using antimicrobials in food animals. He has consulted for multinational corporations on a
        variety of animal issues.</p>
       <p>Rollin is the author of over 500 papers and seventeen books, of which the best known is
        Animal Rights and Human Morality, which won an Outstanding Book of the Year Award from the
        American Association of University Libraries and is entering its third edition. Other books
        by Rollin include The Unheeded Cry: Animal Consciousness, Animal Pain, and Science, The
        Experimental Animal in Biomedical Research, Farm Animal Welfare, The Frankenstein Syndrome:
        Ethical and Social Issues in the Genetic Engineering of Animals, Veterinary Ethics: Theory
        and Cases, Complementary and Alternative Veterinary Medicine Considered, and The Well-Being
        of Farm Animals: Challenges and Solutions. His latest book, a memoir entitled Putting the
        Horse before Descartes: My Life's Work on Behalf of Animals, was released in 2011.</p>
       <p>In 2008 Professor Rollin served on the widely publicized PEW Commission on Industrial Farm
        Animal Production. Dr. Rollin also serves on the Board of Directors for the Global Animal
        Partnership, which recently created a farm animal welfare certification program adopted by
        Whole Foods. Rollin was named to the Distinguished Faculty Gallery by the College of
        Veterinary Medicine at CSU in 1992. He has twice been awarded the Brownlee Award for
        outstanding achievement in Animal Welfare Science by the Animal Welfare Foundation of
        Canada, and the Distinguished Service Award from the Colorado Veterinary Medical
        Association. He was named University Distinguished Professor, Colorado State University's
        highest honor, and was recognized as Eddy Professor, for excellence in teaching, both in
        2001. In 2005, he and his business partners were awarded the Technology Transfer Award from
        the Colorado State University Research Foundation for the retinal identification company
        they founded, Optibrand. In 2005, he was awarded the Henry Spira Award in Animal Welfare by
        Johns Hopkins University Center for Alternatives to Animal Testing.</p>
       <h3>Praise for Professor Rollin's work:</h3>
       <p>"Rollin's voice is an important one in the struggle for animal rights. Rollin brings a
        philosopher's voice of reason to the often heated debate about cruelty to animals."</p>
       <p>--- Jane Goodall, PhD<br/> Founder the Jane Goodall Institute, and UN Messenger of
        Peace</p>
       <p>"Professor Rollin is a serious man with an important message. He asks us not only to
        recognize that those who use animals have moral obligations for their care and respect, but
        also to translate this recognition into new habits. What he asks is reasonable and
        timely."</p>
       <p>--- Journal of the American Medical Association</p>
       <p>"Dr. Rollin is a pioneer who introduced both philosophy and the principles of ethical
        treatment of animals to veterinary school curricula all over the country. In the process, he
        convinced the schools to eliminate cruel laboratory experiments that were a standard part of
        the veterinary school curriculum. His book is an engaging combination of both philosophical
        principles and his experiences. It should be required reading for both veterinary and animal
        science students. I highly recommend this book to everybody who is interested in the ethical
        treatment of animals."</p>
       <p>---Temple Grandin, PhD<br/> Co-author of Animals in Translation and Animals Make Us
        Human</p>
       <p>"...he is an academic but also a pragmatist and he applies his understanding of animal
        issues and human nature to achieve some pretty great successes for the cause."</p>
       <p>---Wayne Pacelle,<br/> President and Chief Executive Officer, The Humane Society of the
        United States</p>

       <p>"I am delighted to see the community respond in such numbers this year, even if their
        hiring projections are for fewer employees" said Ann Adams, director of career services at
        Saint Martin's. "This is always a great opportunity for both our students and our employment
        community to meet face-to-face and learn about each other."</p>
       <p>Adams recommends that job-seekers come prepared by wearing appropriate business attire,
        bringing multiple copies of resumes and brushing up on interview skills in advance. A list
        of employers planning to attend can be found at www.stmartin.edu/career_fair/ .</p>
       <p>Even for those not immediately seeking employment, the fair provides a valuable

       <h3>Evergreen earned accolades as among the nation's Top Public Affairs Graduate Schools in
        the 2012 edition of the Best Graduate Schools by US News Media Group.</h3>
       <p>Evergreen's graduate programs with specific focus on public affairs include the Master in
        Public Administration program and the Master of Environmental Studies program. The Master of
        Public Administration program (MPA) offers public policy, public and nonprofit
        administration, and tribal governance concentrations. Evergreen is the only college in the
        United States that provides students the option of an MPA with a concentration on Tribal
        Governance. The Master of Environmental Studies (MES) program integrates the study of the
        biological, physical and social sciences with public policy.</p>
       <p>Evergreen's Master in Public Administration program is distinctive, with its emphasis on
        social change and democratic governance. Coursework covers critical elements of
        administration such as budgeting, strategic planning, human resources and information
        systems, public law, leadership and ethics, multicultural competencies, political and policy
        analyses and research methods.</p>
       <p>Students in Evergreen's Master of Environmental Studies program explore the interactions
        among environmental problems, policy responses and environmental science with faculty with
        expertise in biological, physical, and social science, providing a more complete
        understanding of environmental issues.</p>
       <p>Evergreen Masters' graduates are working throughout Washington State and the Pacific
        Northwest in responsible positions within state, local, tribal and federal governments,
        education, nonprofit organizations, advocacy organizations, and private industry.</p>
       <p>The cornerstones of an Evergreen education, graduate or undergraduate, include
        collaborative and interdisciplinary teaching and learning, narrative evaluations instead of
        grades, and an emphasis on experiential learning and engaged discussions encompassing
        diverse views.</p>

       <p>New National Science Foundation Scholarships to Expand Opportunities for Interdisciplinary
        Studies in Lab-based Biology and Chemistry at Evergreen</p>
       <p>The National Science Foundation recently awarded The Evergreen State College a S-STEM
        grant of almost $600,000 for scholarships and services to improve student retention and
        success in laboratory-based biology and chemistry. The project also seeks to increase the
        enrollment of groups typically underrepresented in the sciences. Average scholarship awards
        will be $6,750 annually per student.</p>
       <p>The grant, under the direction of Dr. Paula Schofield and Dr. Andrew Brabban, will award
        up to 20 annual scholarships to financially-needy and academically talented undergraduates
        studying lab-based biology and/or chemistry, at Evergreen. These scholarships are renewable.
        Awardees who remain in good standing academically will be funded for up to four years of
        study at Evergreen.</p>
       <p>The grant program aims to foster student success with a strong, supportive learning
        community, regular seminars on career and graduate school opportunities, undergraduate
        research, industry internships, and partnerships with research universities. Biology and
        chemistry faculty will work closely with student support staff--especially in career
        development--to increase scholarship recipients' chances for success.</p>
       <p>The program also seeks to increase bachelor's degree completion of biology and chemistry
        students and motivate more graduates to pursue advanced studies in these fields.</p>
       <p>According to Schofield this opportunity not only removes a significant financial burden
        from students, but also serves to bridge the gap between undergraduate study and a future
        career, under focused faculty mentorship.</p>
       <p>The application deadline for this award in April 14th, 2011. For more information on
        applying for this award, please visit: <a

       <h2>College Promise Coalition to Hold Panel Discussion at Thurston Community Television
        Station on Yauger Way at 6 p.m. on March 14</h2>
       <p>"Let's Keep Our Promise to the Next Generation" Provides Theme for Panel Conversation
        about Higher Education and the Washington State Budget</p>
       <p>The public is invited to find out more about how legislative trends could impact
        Washington families and our economic future at a panel discussion on higher education and
        the Washington State budget. The event will take place March 14 at 6:00 p.m. at Thurston
        Community Television (TCTV). Thurston Community Television is located at 440 Yauger Way SW,
        Suite C, Olympia, WA 98502.</p>
       <p>Between 2008 and 2010, the state cut funding to higher education by 30%. If the currently
        proposed budget is approved, that cut will grow to 50%. This will mean fewer courses,
        elimination of some degree programs, increased class sizes, reduction in the number of
        families eligible for state financial aid and a freeze in enrollment levels for Washington
        students at most colleges and universities.</p>
       <p>Higher education in Washington State is facing a crisis, with our public colleges and
        universities on the brink of losing half of the state support they received just four years
        ago. This path of state disinvestment is undermining educational quality, compromising
        access for today's secondary school students, and creating serious hardships across
        Washington State for students and parents, particularly those of more modest means.</p>
       <p>The event will provide opportunities for questions and observations from the audience. The
        Evergreen State College, Saint Martin's University, and South Puget Sound Community College
        are partnering with the College Promise Coalition to bring you this event. For more on the

       <p>Washington Campus Compact and Inspireum announce the Top 15 Finalists competing for
        $25,000 in scholarships and grants awarded to the nation's most inspirational college
        student civic leaders</p>
       <h3>For Immediate Release</h3>
       <p><strong>Bellingham, WA/Olympia, WA &amp;#8211; March 4, 2011</strong><br/> Washington
        Campus Compact and Inspireum announced today the top 15 finalists for the 2011 Students In
        Service Awards. Alex Becker from The Evergreen State College in Olympia, Washington was
        selected from hundreds of outstanding college students nationwide whose volunteer service
        positively impacts society and inspires others to serve. The Students In Service Awards
        (SISA) program supports students, community organizations, and colleges and universities
        that cultivate student leadership through service.</p>
       <p>Alex is being recognized for his exemplary work documenting homelessness. Alex worked with
        Real Change News, a nonprofit in Seattle, Washington, to produce a collaborative film that
        highlights the voices of eight homeless and low-income street newspaper vendors. These
        vendors sold the film, entitled "Turning Points," for a profit, distributing over 2,000
        copies and earning over $12,000. "Interviewing these homeless individuals has opened my eyes
        to the world around me and inspired me to continue working for social justice," wrote Alex.
        "Most of all, it has taught me how to listen. I plan to attend law school and go into public
        interest law to continue to fight for (and with) those whose voices are too often
        marginalized in our society."</p>
       <p>Finalists were selected by the Washington Campus Compact staff, and two were selected by
        over 450,000 supporters nationwide who voted for their favorite student and project. These
        twelve finalists will compete for $25,000 in academic scholarships and grants through a
        voting and selection process that will happen over the next two weeks.</p>
       <p>"The fifteen finalists have shown amazing initiative and dedication in tackling some of
        the most challenging issues facing communities, from building schools in impoverished
        African communities to skills workshops for incarcerated teens," said Jennifer Dorr,
        executive director of Washington Campus Compact. "They've addressed each social challenge
        with determination and innovation."</p>
       <h4>Voting Still Open</h4>
       <p>Students, educators, family members, and other community members still have a chance to
        vote for their favorite student and service project at www.serviceawards.org through March
        16th, 2011. A national selection committee of esteemed civic leaders will select the winner
        and runner-up, and one "fan favorite" winner will be determined purely by votes from
        supporters across the country. Scholarship recipients and their service projects will be
        recognized at the 14th Annual Continuums of Service Conference, a nationally recognized
        service and civic engagement conference in San Diego, CA, on April 28, 2011.</p>
       <p>"There is no doubt that these students are changing the world. Collectively, they have
        contributed an incredible amount of time, effort, knowledge and leadership toward some of
        the most difficult challenges facing communities around the globe," said Kim Solem, Vice
        President at Inspireum, LLC. "They're also showing us that community service offers
        demonstrable benefits that go far beyond the impact on recipients: service teaches us how to
        become engaged, responsible citizens, and is a vital activity for the positive development
        of the next generation."</p>

        <strong>OLYMPIA, Wash. &amp;#8212; The Evergreen State College ranks No. 11 on Peace Corps'
         2011 rankings of colleges and universities in the small category (less than 5,000
         undergraduates), giving Evergreen the biggest jump in rank in the Northwest (No. 22 in
         2010).</strong>
       </p>
       <p>There are currently 19 undergraduate alumni serving as Peace Corps volunteers.</p>
       <p>"For the last 50 years, colleges and universities across our country have been an integral
        part of the Peace Corps family, from developing young leaders, to hosting trainings and
        teaching the importance of lifelong learning," said Peace Corps Director Aaron S. Williams.
        "In 1961, President Kennedy created the Peace Corps in response to the passion of university
        students, and today we continue to be inspired by the enthusiasm, dedication, and creativity
        of the thousands of Americans now serving overseas. Colleges instill a commitment to public
        service among their students and share our belief that, together, we can work to make the
        world a better place."</p>
       <p>Since 1961, 196 Evergreen alumni have served as Peace Corps volunteers. Today, Peace Corps
        volunteers work in 77 countries in the areas of education, youth and community development,
        health and HIV/AIDS, business information and communication technology, agriculture and
        environment.</p>
       <p>Other Washington universities that placed on the 2011 Top Colleges rankings are University
        of Washington in Seattle (No. 3 in large category), Western Washington University in
        Bellingham (No. 3 in medium category), Gonzaga University in Spokane (No. 3 in small
        category), University of Puget Sound in Tacoma (No. 8 in small category), and Seattle
        University in Seattle (No. 23 in small category).</p>
       <p>Nationally, the University of Colorado at Boulder outpaced other universities in providing
        Peace Corps volunteers, with 117 undergraduate alumni currently serving overseas. Prior to
        2011, the University of Washington held the top spot for four consecutive years.
        Historically, the University of California, Berkeley maintains the number one all-time rank,
        with 3,457 Peace Corps volunteer alumni.</p>
       <p>In the medium school category, The George Washington University ranks number one for the
        third year in a row with 72 undergraduate alumni serving overseas.</p>
       <p>Also for the first time, the University of Mary Washington took the top seat in the small
        school category with 32 undergraduate alumni currently serving volunteers. The University of
        Mary Washington has ranked in the small school category since 2005.</p>
       <p>In the graduate school category, the University of Washington holds the top rank with 21
        currently serving volunteers holding master's degrees from the school. It was tied for first
        place with the University of Texas at Austin last year.</p>

        <strong>Geoducks Team Up With Puget Sound Blood Center for Bone Marrow Drive Screening to be
         Held on February 19 In Conjunction with Cascade</strong>
        <strong>Collegiate Conference Doubleheader</strong>
       </p>
       <p>OLYMPIA, Wash. &amp;#8211; In the fall of 1996, Aaron Foy arrived on the campus of The
        Evergreen State College excited to take on all opponents while representing the green and
        white. Since October, Foy has been in the fight of his life as he battles myelodysplastic
        syndromes (MDS) and the Geoducks are joining him in the clash against cancer as Evergreen
        will host a Bone Marrow Registry Drive on February 19, 2011 in conjunction with the final
        regular season basketball games against Eastern Oregon.</p>
       <p>Teaming up with the Puget Sound Blood Center to conduct the drive, Evergreen hopes to not
        only raise awareness regarding the process of donating bone marrow but help add to the
        registry as well, particularly for minority patients, who have an even tougher time finding
        matching donors.</p>
       <p>The drive is scheduled to run from 5 p.m. to 10 p.m. at in the College Recreation Center
        (CRC) on The Evergreen State College campus. Staff from PSBC will assist fans in completing
        the necessary forms to join the registry as well as have the donor complete a cheek swab so
        that DNA can be entered into the database. Volunteers must be between the ages of 18 to 60
        and meet certain health requirements but even if someone cannot register to be a donor, PSBC
        will be on hand to share other ways that fans can donate to the important cause.</p>
       <p>For Foy, the fight began in October 2010 and since then, he has been working with doctors
        at Seattle Cancer Care Alliance to tackle MDS. Having undergone rigorous chemotherapy since
        being diagnosed and hospital stays due to a decreased immune system, Foy knows that the
        fight against this disease is bigger than him.</p>
       <p>"Everyone gets involved in these situations because they have a loved one going through
        it," said Foy. "But at the same time, everyone who is fighting this disease needs help."</p>
       <p>Foy was the first recruit in Evergreen men's basketball history, playing three years for
        the Geoducks, including the first game in program history when Evergreen earned a win over
        Pacific Lutheran in what Foy described as a rocking CRC Gymnasium.</p>
       <p>"It's something to smile about," said Foy when asked about being on the first team in
        school history. "We started it all. You can't trade those times for anything."</p>
       <p>After Evergreen, Foy headed back up to Tacoma, where he grew up before graduating from
        Stadium High School in 1990 and starting his collegiate basketball career at Tacoma
        Community College. Working with both the Eastside Boys and Girls Club and the Al Davies Boys
        and Girls Club, Foy shared his love of basketball with the youth of Tacoma. After moving on
        to work at Auburn Youth Resources, Foy returned to coaching three years ago, joining the
        staff of Lincoln High School under Aubrey Shelton, whom Foy coached as a youth at the Boys
        and Girls Club.</p>
       <p>Not to be lost in Foy's cancer fight is his loving family, who has been with him every
        step of the way as he tackles this devastating disease. Aaron and his wife Carla have four
        children; son Kashawn (15), daughter Aamori (5) and twins Aamir and Aarmon (16 months).</p>
       <p>While Foy is extremely appreciative of Evergreen helping him get the word out regarding
        his disease and his search for a bone marrow match, he is quick to note that fans shouldn't
        just be concerned with his fight.</p>
       <p>
        <strong>"I want people to come out to help me but if someone else has a need for marrow,
         don't discriminate," said Foy. "Don't donate just for me, donate for everyone."</strong>

       <p>On February 27th at 12:30pm a potluck will be held in the Longhouse at The Evergreen State
        College. Everyone is invited to attend and mark the founding of the Peace Corps.</p>
       <p><strong>Al Guskin</strong>, former Chancellor of Antioch University and member of the
        first Peace Corps group to travel overseas, met with President Kennedy at the U. of Michigan
        in 1961 and urged him to set up such a program which became the Peace Corps.</p>
       <p><strong>Bob Textor</strong> developed the original training materials used by the Peace
        Corps to prepare volunteers for their assignments and went on to serve on the faculty of
        Stanford University for many years. Al and Bob will share with us those heady early days of
        the Kennedy Administration.</p>
       <p>In keeping with the spirit of the Peace Corps, attendees are asked to bring a dish from
        around the world to share, as well as plates and utensils to reduce the amount of trash left
        over.</p>
       <p>The event is co-sponsored by Olympia World Affairs Council (OWAC), the Olympia Area Peace
        Corps Association and The Evergreen State College, <a
         href="site://evergreen.edu - old design/communitybasedlearning/home">Center for Community
         Based Learning and Action</a>.</p>

       <h3>An eminent social historian chronicles the extraordinary impact of Betty Friedan's The
        Feminine Mystique on a "lost generation" of American women</h3>
       <p><strong>A Strange Stirring: The Feminine Mystique and American Women at the Dawn of the
         1960s</strong><br/> By Stephanie Coontz</p>
       <p>"The problem lay buried, unspoken, for many years in the minds of American women. It was a
        strange stirring, a sense of dissatisfaction, a yearning....Each suburban wife struggled
        with it alone. As she made the beds, shopped for groceries, matched slipcover material, ate
        peanut butter sandwiches with her children, chauffeured Cub Scouts and Brownies, lay beside
        her husband at night - she was afraid to ask even of herself the silent question - 'Is this
        All?'"-The Feminine Mystique</p>
       <p>In 1963, thousands of women opened Betty Friedan's The Feminine Mystique and read the
        above paragraph. Nearly 50 years later, many still recall where they were when they read it
        and how it transformed their lives: "everything just clicked"; Friedan "called it
        perfectly"; "I never even knew what I was feeling until I read that first chapter"; "I
        realized I wasn't crazy."</p>
       <p>In <em>A Strange Stirring: The Feminine Mystique and American Women at the Dawn of the
         1960s</em> (Basic Books; January 11, 2011), historian Stephanie Coontz draws on extensive
        research into the popular culture of the 1940s, 1950s and 1960s and personal interviews with
        nearly 200 women and men who read The Feminine Mystique shortly after its publication to
        explore how the wives and daughters of "The Greatest Generation" of men almost became the
        lost generation of women. Challenging both liberal and conservative myths about what Friedan
        actually advocated and why so many women responded to her, Coontz reminds us of the dangers
        of hearkening back to the 1950s and 1960s as a simpler, more satisfying time. "We still
        haven't fully figured out how to combine a loving family life with a rewarding work life,"
        Coontz writes. "But The Feminine Mystique reminds us of the price women pay when we retreat
        from trying to resolve these dilemmas or fail to involve men in our attempts."</p>
       <p>As Coontz explains, the advances of the suffrage movement and the new social freedoms of
        the roaring 1920s destroyed the old veneration of female purity and self-sacrificing
        motherhood without providing women with any new social respect as individuals. While men
        made enormous economic and political gains in the 1950s and 1960s, women remained legally
        and social subordinate. In 1963 husbands still retained legal control over almost every
        aspect of family life. Unmarried women couldn't get credit in their own name, and
        gender-segregated help-wanted ads advertised for "pretty" gal Fridays. Freudian therapists
        insisted that normal women found complete fulfillment in homemaking, but popular culture
        blamed homemaker mothers for emasculating their husbands and infantilizing their sons.
        Coontz's interviews paint a moving portrait of the pain, confusion, and self-doubt that
        these mixed messages created in women.</p>
       <p>Betty Friedan's The Feminine Mystique was the first popular book to tell women it was not
        their fault that they felt trapped and discontented - that society was at fault for
        denigrating and wasting their capacities. Friedan's insistence that an ordinary woman could
        be a person in her own right, in addition to being a wife and mother, came as a revelation
        to many women, Coontz notes.</p>
       <p>Coontz debunks the idea that Friedan was a man-hater, that The Feminine Mystique was
        anti-marriage, and that, by encouraging women to pursue higher education and devote
        themselves to their careers, feminism destabilized marriage and doomed many women to a life
        of loneliness. Yet she also counters many myths that Friedan herself promoted about the
        origins and consequences of the book. While conceding that Friedan addressed herself only to
        white, middle-class women, Coontz challenges the common view that African-American women
        would have loved to devote themselves to full-time homemaking. The real problem with
        Friedan's neglect of black women, Coontz shows, was that she could have used them as an
        example of how women could combine their identities as wives, mothers, citizens, and
        workers.</p>
       <p>In her concluding chapter, Coontz summarizes what has changed for women, men, and families
        and what has not, arguing that although the old feminine mystique no longer prevails, new
        ones have taken its place. She also challenges media accounts that pit men against women and
        stay-at-home mothers against employed mothers. "Betty Friedan asked us to imagine a world
        where men and women can both find meaningful, socially useful work and also participate in
        the essential activities of love and caregiving for children, partners, parents, friends,
        and neighbors," Coontz writes, and "that goal is even more relevant today."</p>

        love, revelry, music, arrogance, sexual confusion, mistaken identity, and pride; and that's
        just Act I. Although the land of Illyria is saturated in love, it is that kind of love that
        causes more injuries than kindnesses. When Viola washes ashore off the coast of Illyria and
        takes on the disguise of a man she is herself caught in a sticky love triangle. Then the
        real party begins. Illyria is turned into a topsy-turvy free for all, but don't worry,
        Shakespeare's darkest comedy ends well... for almost everyone.</p>

       <p>It began as a small project to involve prison inmates in environmental research, but has
        turned into a set of major green innovations in several of our state's prisons. On the next
        episode of <a href="http://www.kcts9.org">KCTS 9</a> Connects, The Sustainable Prisons
        Project.</p>
       <h3>The Sustainable Prisons Project.</h3>
       <p>Started by Evergreen State College professor Nalini Nadkarni, the program offers classes
        and lectures about sustainability to inmates. The program, which started at Cedar Creek
        Correctional Facility, has now expanded to three other prisons as well, including McNeil
        Island, Stafford Creek, and the Purdy women's prison. The broadcast will note how it's
        offering inmates a unique chance at rehabilitation, and helping our prisons save money and
        become more sustainable at the same time.</p>

       <p>Sarah Works announced this week that she will be leaving the Director of Recreation and
        Athletics position at The Evergreen State College and plans to transition back to academic
        work after the completion of the current fall sports season.</p>
       <p>Since taking the helm in March, Director Works has made head coaching hires for men's
        basketball, women's soccer, and volleyball, and has filled positions in campus recreation,
        business operations, and athletic training. Works has also guided an effort to advance
        intramural sports at Evergreen, and has guided the establishment of student-led recreation
        programs in yoga, tai chi, rock climbing, and cardio fitness.</p>
       <p>"Evergreen is an exceptional educational institution," said Works. "While it has been a
        true joy to help build the foundation here for a strong future in both intercollegiate
        athletics and campus recreation, I realized that at this point, my interests remain more
        firmly rooted in academics and law."</p>
       <p>Prior to joining the college administration at Evergreen, Works taught philosophy at the
        University of Arizona, and worked as an attorney in the areas of sports and entertainment
        law, business law, environmental law, and federal Indian law. She plans to pursue academic
        work and resume her legal practice.</p>
       <p>"We appreciate the work Sarah has done for the college," said Art Costantino, Vice
        President for Student Affairs. "In her time here, she evidenced a strong commitment to
        gender equity, built relationships with faculty and enhanced recreational programming."</p>
       <p>"We understand and support Sarah's dedication to academics and Indian law," added
        Costantino. "Our campus recreation and intercollegiate programs have successfully addressed
        a number of key issues during her time as director."</p>
       <p>Executive Associate to the Vice President for Student Affairs Wendy Endress will serve as
        Interim Athletic Director. She will work with Evergreen's seasoned coaches to maintain
        support for Evergreen student athletics and recreation programs. Endress has more than 20
        years experience as an administrator and has worked with athletics on staffing and budget
        issues.</p>

        applying for college and financial aid, immigration, financial literacy, insights into
        specific careers such as trades, teaching, public safety and health care, and fostering
        healthy relationships. The event also will feature a performance from local group Lozen and

        students, graduates, and professionals.</p>

       <h3>Get weather updates via email or cell phone by signing up for e2Campus</h3>
       <p>The Evergreen State College has adopted the e2Campus emergency notification system that
        enables the school to send urgent news via text-messaging to your cell phone and/or
        email.</p>
       <p>The service is available to all current students, faculty and staff of The Evergreen State
        College. Once you sign up for the service, the school can text your cell phone and/or email
        with timely information about emergencies and school closures and delayed starts (no general
        or non-urgent messages). Depending on your personal cell phone plan, there may be a nominal
        fee from your carrier to receive text messages, but there is no charge from the school to
        use the service.</p>
       <p>While e2Campus is designed to facilitate communication during inclement weather or
        emergencies, no single system can guarantee the ability to reach all subscribers in all
        circumstances. Therefore we work to announce weather in multiple ways:</p>
       <ul>
        <li>E2 Campus notification (<a href="http://www.evergreen.edu/facilities/emergency">sign
          up</a> for this free text message and/or email notification)</li>
        <li>
         <a href="http://www.evergreen.edu">The college website</a>
        </li>
        <li>Evergreen's information number (360) 867-6000 (recorded information)</li>

       <p>Award-Winning Filmmaker Yolanda Cruz to Present her Work on Immigration and Indigenous
        Identity in the Global Economy at Evergreen November 2 in Lecture Hall 1 at 7 pm</p>
       <p>Yolanda Cruz, an award-winning Chatino filmmaker from Oaxaca, Mexico, will present her
        most recent film and engage in discussion on documentary filmmaking and her experiences
        filming in indigenous Oaxacan villages, where migration to the U.S. has significantly
        changed the reality of life on both sides of the border. The event will take place on
        November 2 at The Evergreen State College in Lecture Hall 1 at 7 p.m.</p>
       <p>Yolanda Cruz will also be a guest of the Shelton public schools, where she will be showing
        "2501 Migrants" to junior high school and high school students and will discuss the
        experiences that led her to become a filmmaker.</p>
       <p>Cruz, a Sundance Institute NativeLab Fellow has produced seven documentaries on native
        people in the US and Mexico. Her first film while a graduate student at UCLA, Entre
        Sue&amp;#241;os, was selected to the Sundance Film Festival in 2000.</p>
       <p>Her other films include: Women Who Organize, a look at Mixtec women who have created a
        mini-credit to provide emergency funds to their community and Sue&amp;#241;os Binacionales,
        a documentary about the bi-national experience of indigenous immigrants from Mexico.
        Guenati'za (The Visitors) is the story of Ulises, an Indian Zapotec who is a gardener in Los
        Angeles. The film follows him back to his community to host a traditional party in the
        Northern Mountains of Oaxaca. MENA features the stories of a group of indigenous women who
        are organizing the exportation of their product, the nopal cactus, to the United States.</p>
       <p>Cruz' recent film, 2501 Migrants: A Journey, is a feature-length documentary that explores
        global migration through the art of Oaxacan artist, Alejandro Santiago. Upon his return from
        France to his village, Teococuilco, Alejandro experiences, first hand, the reality that
        Oaxaca has emerged as one of Mexico's leading exporters of human labor to the United States.
        In response, he decides to create a monumental installation art work: 2,501 life-size
        sculptures, in homage to each migrant who left his village.</p>
       <p>The film was an Official Selection at the Santa Barbara International Film Festival and
        was the Winner for Best Documentary Film at the Expresi&amp;#243;n en Corto International
        Film Festival. Additionally, 2501 Migrants has screened at Los Angeles County Museum of Art
        and the Santa Barbara Museum of Art. It is also being screened at the Smithsonian in New
        York and Washington DC during Hispanic Heritage Month (September 15 - October 15).</p>
       <p>Cruz' work has received support from The Rockefeller Foundation, Latino Public
        Broadcasting and the Ford Foundation. Her films have been screened at film festivals and
        museums internationally, including the Sundance Film Festival, the Guggenheim Museum in New
        York, Park la Villette in Paris and the National Institute of Cinema in Mexico City. Cruz is
        fluent in English, Spanish and Chatino, and harbors a passionate drive to increase the
        representation of indigenous people in the media.</p>
       <p>In 2003, she formed Petate Productions. The focus of the company is to connect the voices
        of sustainable indigenous communities in Mexico with their new, still very Oaxacan
        communities throughout the U.S.</p>
       <p>Yolanda Cruz graduated from The Evergreen State College with a concentration in filmmaking
        and film studies. She received her MFA from the University of California at Los Angeles. She
        currently lives in Los Angeles with her husband. For more information about Yolanda's work,

       <p>Evergreen and Partners Help Middle and High School Students Find a Path to College</p>
       <p>As part of its commitment to access and diversity, Evergreen has been a longtime partner
        with the GEAR UP program for low-income students (Gaining Early Awareness and Readiness for
        Undergraduate Programs). The Governor has issued a proclamation declaring today Washington
        GEAR UP Day to recognize the work done by colleges, schools and community organizations
        across the state to raise awareness of college opportunities and improve access to higher
        education.</p>
       <p>Washington GEAR UP serves over 27,000 students in grades 6-12 and has helped thousands of
        students achieve their dreams of a college education since its inception in 1999.</p>
       <p>Evergreen's GEAR UP staff would like to recognize and thank its partners today - <a
         href="http://www.evergreen.edu/gearup/communitypartners.htm">parents, students, community
         organizations, school staff, and members of the Evergreen community</a> - for their active

       <p>Over the past two decades, the U.S. News college rankings, which group schools based on
        categories created by the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching, has grown as
        a research tool for students and parents considering higher education opportunities.</p>
       <p>The 2011 Best Colleges feature the US News rankings of the Best National Universities and
        Best National Liberal Arts Colleges. Evergreen was recognized for a strong commitment to
        teaching by the magazine. It was also among the top tier, best colleges in the West, with
        only four public colleges ranking higher in a region that ranges from Texas to Washington
        State. Evergreen's overall ranking in the West was 29th in the Best Regional category for
        the West.</p>
       <p>The 2011 Best Colleges provides an examination of how more than 1,400 accredited four-year
        schools compare on a set of up to 16 widely accepted indicators of excellence. Among the
        factors weighed in determining the rankings, key measures of quality are: peer assessment,
        graduation and retention rates, faculty resources, student selectivity, financial resources,
        and alumni giving.</p>

       <h3>College guidebook uniquely targets low-income, first-generation college-bound
        students</h3>
       <h5>For Immediate Release</h5>
       <p>Young people in all socioeconomic groups have college aspirations. In fact, eight out of
        10 expect to attain a bachelor's degree or higher, according to the U.S. Department of
        Education. But despite these aspirations, low-income students and those who are the first in
        their families to pursue higher education are severely underrepresented on college
        campuses.</p>
       <p>According to the College Board, high-achieving students from low-income families have
        about the same chance of enrolling in college as low-achieving students from wealthier
        families. And even worse, those who do make it to college are not finding supportive college
        environments or graduating. A recent USA Today article notes that 89 percent of low-income,
        first-generation students leave college within six years without a degree.</p>
       <p>The Evergreen State College is working to change this trend and has been recognized in
        Center for Student Opportunity's 2011 College Access &amp; Opportunity Guide, a
        comprehensive college guidebook designed to help low-income, first-generation college-bound
        students make their college dreams a reality.</p>
       <p>According to data provided by <a
         href="site://evergreen.edu - old design/institutionalresearch/home">Evergreen's
         Institutional Research and Assessment Office</a> , 27 percent of students were first
        generation in Fall 2009, with a rising proportion of students since 2007. Evergreen defines
        "first generation" as students for whom none of their parents earned a four-year college
        degree or higher. In Fall 2009, 36.7 percent of students were low income (defined as
        &amp;#8804;150% federal poverty level).</p>
       <p>Published by <em>Sourcebooks</em>, a leader in college guides and study aids, the 2011
        College Access &amp; Opportunity is significant breakthrough in providing students and their
        supporters with the necessary information to pursue and succeed in college.</p>
       <h5>The Guide features</h5>
       <ul>
        <li>284 colleges and universities highlighted for their outreach efforts, financial aid
         opportunities and student support services</li>
        <li>A 4 step plan to college developed by partners, KnowHow2GO</li>
        <li>Articles and advice from college students and other experts</li>
        <li>Valuable information for parents and mentors, including a new Spanish-language
         section</li>
       </ul>
       <blockquote>
        <p>"We want to show students and their supporters that the opportunity for college is
         there," said Matt Rubinoff, Executive Director of Center for Student Opportunity. "The 2011
         College Access &amp; Opportunity Guide is a special resource that provides guidance through
         the college process and delivers important information on college programs aimed to serve
         low-income, first-generation college students."</p>

       <h2>The Evergreen State College Honored by Inclusion in G.I. Jobs 2011 College List</h2>
       <p>&amp;#8216;Military Friendly Schools&amp;#8217; List Aims to Help Veterans Find Colleges
        that are a Good Fit</p>
       <p>G.I. Jobs recently announced the release of its 2011 list of Military Friendly Schools at
        www.militaryfriendlyschools.com/2011list. The list honors the top 15 percent of colleges,
        universities and trade schools which are doing the most to embrace America&amp;#8217;s
        veterans as students.</p>
       <p>The Evergreen State College was included on this list.</p>
       <p>Schools on the list range from state universities and private colleges to community
        colleges and trade schools. The common bond is their shared priority of recruiting students
        with military experience.</p>
       <h3>Innovations in Policy and Practice at Evergreen</h3>
       <p>Evergreen is becoming widely recognized as a leader in working to provide a supportive and
        welcoming environment for student veterans.</p>
       <ul>
        <li>Evergreen has an established Veterans Support Working Group made up of students, staff
         and faculty -- and a Student Veteran Organization.</li>
        <li>Last May, The Evergreen State College organized the first ever regional higher education
         summit on veterans&amp;#8217; needs, experiences and retention. War and the Soul: Creating
         Healing Academic Communities for Our Nation&amp;#8217;s Veterans provided a training and
         networking conference for those in the higher education and military communities. The
         summit attracted participants throughout the Pacific Northwest, and featured
         internationally renowned experts Edward Tick and Nancy Schiesari.</li>
        <li>Annual events include a Fall Quarter Veterans Reception in which a Veterans Medallion is
         presented to all identified incoming veterans in recognition of their service, a tradition
         of celebration of Veterans Day for the past 16 years, and Memorial Day recognition efforts
         including distribution of some 2,000 Memorial Day poppies among a college population of
         some 5,600 (including students, faculty and staff.)</li>
        <li>Evergreen also aims to attract veterans and their dependents through recruitment
         efforts, outreach and tuition waivers year round for qualifying veterans and
         veterans&amp;#8217; dependents.</li>
       </ul>
       <h3>GI Jobs Compiles List as Resource for Veterans</h3>
       <p>The GI Jobs list was compiled through exhaustive research starting last April when the
        magazine polled more than 7,000 schools nationwide. Methodology, criteria and weighting for
        the list were developed with the assistance of an Academic Advisory Board (AAB) consisting
        of educators from Carnegie Mellon University, Duquesne University, Colorado State
        University, Dallas County Community College, Old Dominion University, Cleveland State
        University, Lincoln Technical Institute and Embry Riddle; as well as Keith Wilson,
        VA&amp;#8217;s director of education services; Michele Spires, American Council on
        Education&amp;#8217;s assistant director of military programs; Janet Swandol, associate
        director for CLEP and Derek Blumke, president of Student Veterans of America. A full list of
        board members can be found at <a
         href="http://militaryfriendlyschools.com/Article/advisory-board/"
         >http://militaryfriendlyschools.com/Article/advisory-board/</a></p>
       <p>A full story and detailed list of Military Friendly Schools will be highlighted in G.I.
        Jobs annual Guide to Military Friendly Schools and on a poster, both of which will be
        distributed to hundreds of thousands of active and former military personnel in late
        September. The newly redesigned website, found at www.militaryfriendlyschools.com, features
        interactive tools and search functionality to assist military veterans in choosing schools
        that best meet their personal educational needs. The site currently shows 2010 Military
        Friendly Schools but will switch to the 2011 list in late September. Criteria for making the
        Military Friendly Schools list included efforts to recruit and retain military and veteran
        students, results in recruiting military and veteran students and academic
        accreditations.</p>

       <h2>The Evergreen State College Ranks Third among America&amp;#8217;s Top 20
        &amp;#8220;Coolest&amp;#8221; Schools by Sierra Magazine</h2>
       <p>
        <strong>Evergreen praised in top list for green efforts for the third consecutive
         year</strong>
       </p>
       <p>Sierra magazine has named the nation&amp;#8217;s top 20 &amp;#8220;coolest&amp;#8221;
        schools for their efforts to stop global warming and operate sustainably. From Green
        Mountain College&amp;#8217;s innovative biomass electricity generation to Georgia
        Tech&amp;#8217;s sustainable engineering classes, the magazine&amp;#8217;s September/October
        cover story spotlights the schools that are making a true difference for the planet, and
        marks Sierra&amp;#8217;s fourth annual listing of America&amp;#8217;s greenest universities
        and colleges. The complete list is available online at <a
         href="http://www.sierraclub.org/coolschools">http://www.sierraclub.org/coolschools</a>.</p>
       <p>The Evergreen State College placed third on the list. Sustainability initiatives at
        Evergreen include efforts to reduce waste, conserve energy, achieve climate neutrality, as
        well as the college&amp;#8217;s work to provide learning resources through its salmon-safe
        certified organic farm and sustainable living and food choice options in which students
        consciously choose a better way to relate to their natural world.</p>
       <p>&amp;#8220;With all of the environmental challenges we face, it&amp;#8217;s heartening to
        see the leadership schools like Evergreen demonstrate when it comes to protecting the
        planet,&amp;#8221; said Michael Brune, the Sierra Club&amp;#8217;s executive director.
        &amp;#8220;This generation of students cares deeply about protecting the environment,
        stopping global warming, and increasing our prosperity through innovation.&amp;#8221;</p>
       <p>This year&amp;#8217;s top-20 coolest schools are taking dramatic steps to curb climate
        change. From small, environmentally focused liberal arts colleges to the largest research
        universities, schools across the country are helping to move the country towards a more
        sustainable future.</p>

       <h3>Evergreen Featured in "The Best 373 Colleges" by The Princeton Review</h3>
       <p>
        <strong>Evergreen Also Earns Top Score of 99 on Princeton Review&amp;#8217;s Green
         Rating</strong>
       </p>
       <p>The Evergreen State College is one of the country's best institutions for undergraduate
        education, according to The Princeton Review. The education services company features the
        school in the new 2011 edition of its annual college guide, "The Best 373 Colleges."</p>
       <p>Only about 15% of America&amp;#8217;s 2,500 four-year colleges and two Canadian colleges
        are profiled in the book, which is The Princeton Review's flagship college guide. It
        includes detailed profiles of the colleges with rating scores for all schools in eight
        categories.</p>
       <p>The Evergreen State College also achieved a Green Rating of 99, the highest possible
        score, placing it on Princeton&amp;#8217;s Green Honor Roll. The top Green Rating comes
        after numerous accolades including most recently recognition by Edward Fiske as one of the
        top 10 ten undergraduate environmental studies programs and previous green awards and
        recognitions by Princeton Review, Sierra Magazine, and Grist Magazine, among others.</p>
       <p>The schools in The Best 373 Colleges have ratings that The Princeton Review tallies based
        on institutional data collected from the schools during the 2009-10 academic year and/or its
        student survey for the book. The ratings scores are on a scale of 60 to 99 and they appear
        in each school profile. The eight categories include: Academics, Admissions Selectivity,
        Financial Aid, Fire Safety, and Green, a measure of school's commitment to
        environmentally-related policies, practices and education. The Princeton Review explains the
        basis for each rating score in the book and at
        www.princetonreview.com/college/college-ratings.aspx</p>
       <p>Robert Franek, Princeton Review's Senior Vice President of Publishing and author of The
        Best 373 Colleges, says "We commend Evergreen for its outstanding academics, which is the
        primary criteria for our selection of schools for the book. Our choices are based on
        institutional data we collect about schools, our visits to schools over the years, feedback
        we gather from students attending the schools, and the opinions of our staff and our
        28-member National College Counselor Advisory Board. We also work to keep a wide
        representation of colleges in the book by region, size, selectivity and character."</p>
       <p>The Princeton Review does not rank the colleges in the book academically or from 1 to 373
        in any category. Instead it reports in the book 62 ranking lists of "top 20" colleges in
        various categories. The lists are entirely based on The Princeton Review's survey of 122,000
        students (about 325 per campus on average) attending the colleges in the book and not on The
        Princeton Review's opinion of the schools. The 80-question survey asks students to rate
        their own schools on several topics and report on their campus experiences at them. Topics
        range from assessments of their professors as teachers to opinions about their financial aid
        and campus food. Other ranking lists are based on student reports about their student body's
        political leanings, race/class relations, and LGBT community acceptance. The Princeton
        Review explains the basis for each ranking list in the book and at
        www.princetonreview.com/college/college-rankings.aspx</p>
       <p>The Princeton Review has posted the school profiles and ranking lists in The Best 373
        Colleges at PrincetonReview.com. There visitors can find further information about the book,
        the student survey, the rankings, the ratings, and other features in the book including its
        "Honor Roll" lists saluting schools with ratings of 99 in various categories, and "Best
        Value Colleges for 2010" list.</p>

        <strong>Governor Gregoire Appoints Nathan Brockett as New Student Trustee to The Evergreen
         State College Board of Trustees</strong>
       </p>
       <p>Nathan Brockett is a senior at Evergreen pursuing a Bachelors of Arts and Sciences with
        emphases in Molecular Biology and Social Change through Nonprofit Leadership. Nathan will
        join the Board of Trustees on July 26, 2010 and will continue through June 30, 2011.</p>
       <h4>About Nathan Brockett</h4>
       <p>Nathan Brockett brings to Evergreen a personal history of working for empowerment and
        encouraging people to embrace differences.</p>
       <p>Currently Nathan serves as the chair on the Board of Directors for Stonewall Youth, a
        local queer youth empowerment nonprofit that began twenty years ago as a student group at
        Evergreen.</p>
       <p>Nathan also serves as vice-president of the Board of Directors for the United Communities
        Aids Network (UCAN) and has been an integral part in strategically repositioning the
        organization, helping to realize a collaborative model through a downtown move and
        co-location with Stonewall Youth and Partners in Prevention Education (PIPE).</p>
       <p>Engaged in a pattern of proactive volunteerism, Nathan coordinates the Friends of
        Stonewall Youth fundraising and outreach committee and has chaired a variety of committees
        in the past.</p>
       <p>Nathan is from Eugene Oregon. At the age of seventeen through participation in the Youth
        Action Board, Nathan worked to identify and remedy the problem of underrepresentation of
        youth in positions of leadership.</p>
       <p>Nathan was an organizer and presenter at the Youth Empowerment Summit, working with the
        city mayor to address concerns of ageism and homophobia in the city police. Community
        education efforts became regular affairs. Presentations, workshops, and seminars for the
        Oregon Family Support Network, Power of Hope Leadership Summit, District Cross-Cultural
        Leadership Conference, state Gay-Straight Alliance Summit, and many other efforts were soon
        to follow.</p>
       <p>On campus, Nathan has been the Resident Assistant for Gender Neutral Housing and the Peer
        Educator on Smoking. Nathan also rekindled the Trans and Queer accessibility work group and
        now participates in their standing committee.</p>
       <p>A history of outstanding academic achievement and activism has led to Nathan earning merit
        and tuition awards including Advanced Placement Scholar with Distinction, the Portland Area
        Business Association award, the Armistead Maupin Creative Writing award, and the National
        Science Foundation scholarship for outstanding academic promise. Nathan is also the two-time
        recipient of the Thayer Raymond Memorial scholarship for outstanding community service.</p>
       <p>Nathan consistently demonstrates a passion for education, paired with a deep commitment to
        transforming oppression--due to age, socioeconomics, gender identity or expression, sexual
        orientation, race, ability, background or experience--into unconditional respect for our
        sameness and open celebration of our differences.</p>
       <p class="details">Nathan has asked that no pronouns (he/she/him/her/his/hers/etc.) be used
        in this bio. This is in solidarity with gender equity outside of the gender binary
        (man/woman), and in keeping with their identity.</p>

       <p><strong>(Olympia, Wash.)</strong> Students in Machiya II -- a course that explores
        traditional Japanese culture -- are constructing a Japanese inspired gate on the trail from
        the Longhouse to the Organic Farm. Daryl Morgan, faculty at Evergreen, has been planning the
        project for three years.</p>
       <p>The gate incorporates elements of both Sukiya and Shoin style architecture. Sukiya
        architecture is the more rustic style of teahouses. Shoin originally referred to the room
        used for studying and daily living, but developed into a style adopted by the 15th Japanese
        military elite who wanted to imitate the style at the imperial court. There will be a small
        exhibit of models created by Sukiya I that show the development of Japanese architectural
        style in June. The construction is a gabled-roofed, six post, open portal gate designed and
        built in the style of a late 17th Century garden gate. The structure is made of recycled
        timber and will have minimal environmental impact. The timber was donated by Puget Sound
        Energy and the City of Olympia Urban Forestry Department.</p>

       <p>Thurston County nonprofit organizations can receive volunteer help for hands-on projects
        as part of United Way of Thurston County's 18th annual Day of Caring on September 24.</p>
       <p>Day of Caring is an annual event where hundreds of volunteers from throughout Thurston
        County join local nonprofit and other community organizations to work on service projects.
        Participating organizations are matched with volunteers who give their time, talent and
        services to change our community for the better in one day.</p>
       <p>Not only does Day of Caring have a significant impact on the needs of local nonprofits, it
        also enables volunteers to meet new people, work as a team and gain new experiences. Day of
        Caring also kicks off United Way's annual campaign which raises funds to meet local health
        and human service needs.</p>
       <p>Day of Caring also coordinates with The Evergreen State College's "Community to Community
        Action Day", which engages incoming college freshmen in local volunteer projects during
        their orientation week.</p>
       <p>United Way, in partnership with the Volunteer Center of Lewis, Mason &amp; Thurston
        Counties, invites agencies to submit a project through an easy online registration process.
        To sign up to host a project, go to www.volunteer.ws . The deadline for applications is
        August 1.</p>

       <h3>Evergreen also Noted by Edward Fiske as one of 10 Top Schools for Environmental
        Studies</h3>
       <p>The Fiske Guide to Colleges 2011 features 45 of the Best Buy Schools. These institutions
        are based on the quality of academic offerings in relation to the cost of attendance.</p>
       <p>This year, Fiske names 45 institutions&amp;#8212;21 public and 24 private&amp;#8212;as
        Best Buys. These institutions fall into the inexpensive or moderate price category with four
        or five star academic ratings, and prove that sometimes the price and quality of a
        university do not go hand and hand.</p>
       <h3>The Evergreen State College is a 2011 Fiske Best Buy School.</h3>
       <p>Other Pacific Northwest Schools included are University of Oregon, Oregon State
        University, and University of Washington.</p>

       <h2>Washington Campus Compact AmeriCorps Retention Project Data Released</h2>
       <h3>The Evergreen State College Students Contribute over 2,000 Hours Mentoring Youth</h3>
       <p>Bellingham, Washington, May 11, 2010 &amp;#8211; Students at The Evergreen State College
        have contributed over 2,000 hours in mentoring students, most through the Gateways for
        Incarcerated Youth. These efforts are organized by the AmeriCorps Retention Project, funded
        by Washington Campus Compact, a program that supports and directs efforts to recruit college
        students to mentor at-risk youth to prepare them for college.</p>
       <p>The Retention Project has placed 20 AmeriCorps members at 15 campuses statewide and has
        long had a presence at The Evergreen State College and its Gateways for Incarcerated Youth.
        In this model, Evergreen students are recruited and trained by the AmeriCorps member to
        mentor incarcerated youth at two state juvenile detention facilities, Maple Lane and Green
        Hill. The program serves approximately 40-45 juveniles at Maple Lane and 20 young men at
        Green Hill each year. The number of hours already served in mentoring and academic support
        by Evergreen students is over 2,000 hours.</p>
       <p>Sixty one Evergreen students are members of AmeriCorps Students in Service. They can be
        found tutoring, working in school gardens, at the food banks, fighting homelessness,
        supporting literacy programs and much more.</p>
       <p>Established in 1992 and hosted at Western Washington University, Washington Campus Compact
        is committed to providing meaningful experiences for students to become active, engaged
        leaders in their communities, furthering the civic and public purposes of higher education,
        and strengthening communities. Washington Campus Compact has 35 college and university
        members throughout Washington state. It is an affiliate state office of Campus Compact, a
        national organization comprised of more than 1,200 colleges and universities committed to
        the civic and public purposes of higher education.</p>

       <p>The Master of Environmental Studies (MES) program at The Evergreen State College will be
        showing Beyond the Motor City, a new PBS documentary directed by acclaimed filmmaker Aaron
        Woolf (King Corn) and produced as part of BLUEPRINT AMERICA, the precedent-setting,
        multi-platform initiative&amp;#8212;produced by Thirteen/WNET and funded by the Rockefeller
        Foundation&amp;#8212;that shines a spotlight on one of our country&amp;#8217;s most critical
        issues: America&amp;#8217;s decaying and neglected infrastructure. Beyond the Motor City
        examines how Detroit, a grim symbol of America&amp;#8217;s diminishing status in the world,
        may come to represent the future of transportation and progress in this country. The film
        explores Detroit&amp;#8217;s historic investments in infrastructure&amp;#8212;from early
        19th-century canals to the urban freeways that gave The Motor City its name and made
        America&amp;#8217;s transportation system the envy of the world. But it also reveals that
        over the last 30 years, much of the world has left Detroit&amp;#8212;and
        America&amp;#8212;behind, choosing faster, cleaner, more modern transportation.</p>
       <p>In a journey that takes us into the neighborhoods of Detroit and then beyond to Spain,
        California, and our nation&amp;#8217;s capital, Beyond the Motor City urges us to ask how a
        symbol of America&amp;#8217;s urban decay might transform itself into a model of urban
        revitalization. Can we finally push America&amp;#8217;s transit system into the 21st
        century? Film will show 7pm-8:30pm followed by a 30-45 minute film discussion facilitated by
        MES faculty member, Rob Knapp. For more information, visit the film&amp;#8217;s website at

       <h3>About Ralph Nader</h3>
       <p>Ralph Nader is one of America's most effective social critics. Named by The Atlantic as
        one of the 100 most influential figures in American history, and by Time and Life magazines
        as one of the hundred most influential Americans of the twentieth century, Nader&amp;#8217;s
        documented criticism of government and industry has had widespread effect on public
        awareness and bureaucratic power. He is the "U.S.'s toughest customer" says Time magazine.
        His inspiration and example have galvanized a whole population of consumer advocates,
        citizen activists, and public interest lawyers who in turn have established their own
        organizations throughout the country.</p>
       <p>For over four decades, Nader has exposed problems and organized millions of citizens into
        more than 100 public interest groups to advocate for solutions. His efforts have helped
        create a framework of laws, regulatory agencies, and federal standards that have improved
        the quality of life for two generations of Americans. Because of Ralph Nader we drive safer
        cars, eat healthier food, breathe better air, drink cleaner water, and work in safer
        environments.</p>
       <p>The crusading attorney first made headlines in 1965 with his book Unsafe at Any Speed, a
        scathing indictment that lambasted the auto industry for producing unsafe vehicles. The book
        led to congressional hearings and a series of automobile safety laws passed in 1966,
        including the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act.</p>
       <p>This event is sponsored by S &amp; A Productions at The Evergreen State College.</p>

       <p>The Smithsonian's National Museum of the American Indian announces the eight recipients of
        the 2010 Visual and Expressive Arts Program award. The museum's award program offers support
        to a wide range of arts activities with the goal of increasing knowledge, understanding and
        appreciation of contemporary Native American arts.</p>
       <p>&amp;#8220;The National Museum of the American Indian is dedicated to supporting the
        creative, collaborative and innovative spirit of contemporary Native artists through the
        Visual and Expressive Arts Program, which has been graciously sponsored by the Ford
        Foundation,&amp;#8221; said Kevin Gover ( Pawnee ), director of the museum.</p>
       <h3>Exhibitions and Publications</h3>
       <p>The Exhibitions and Publications award recipients are The Evergreen State College, the
        Museum of Contemporary Native Arts, Riverside Metropolitan Museum and the Museum of Arts and
        Design.</p>
       <p>The Evergreen State College, based in Olympia, Wash., has organized the exhibition,
        &amp;#8220;Pieces of Home&amp;#8221; featuring the work of Native artists Sarah Sense (
        Chitimacha ), Maria Hupfield ( Wasauksing ), Kade Twist ( Cherokee ), Jason Lujan (
        Chiricahua Apache ), Kimowan McLain ( Cree ), Nicholas Galanin ( Tlingit ) and Merritt
        Johnson ( Mohawk/Blackfoot ) who will address the concept of &amp;#8220;home.&amp;#8221; Is
        a home a house, a place, a reservation, an ecological region, a spiritual landscape, a
        gathering of family and friends? What are the dynamics of the very literal legal and
        geographic boundaries to &amp;#8220;home&amp;#8221; as on tribal lands, reservations,
        pueblos and reserves? Whether by choice or by forced relocation, how do people leave one
        home and make another place home? All of these questions and more will be addressed in this
        exhibition of mixed media, wallpaper, traditional basket weaving, painting, video and
        performance and installation art.</p>
       <p>Museum of Contemporary Native Arts, in Santa Fe, N.M., will support the creation of a
        newly commissioned site-specific installation titled, &amp;#8220;It Wasn&amp;#8217;t the
        Dream of Golden Cities&amp;#8221; for the museum&amp;#8217;s outdoor Allen Houser Art Park.
        The installation is part of a series of site-specific installations/exhibitions by Kade
        Twist ( Cherokee ), Steven Yazzie ( Laguna/Navajo ), Raven Chacon ( Navajo ), Nathan Young (
        Delaware/Kiowa/Pawnee ), known as the artist collective &amp;#8220;Postcommodity,&amp;#8221;
        which respond to the 400th-anniversary celebration of the founding of Santa Fe and serve as
        an intervention on behalf of the indigenous people who are the original stewards of this
        land.</p>
       <p>Riverside Metropolitan Museum in Riverside, Calif., will organize the exhibition
        &amp;#8220;American Indian Women Artists: Beyond Craft,&amp;#8221; which will focus on the
        work of four outstanding contemporary Native women artists: Anita Fields ( Osage ), Teri
        Greeves ( Kiowa ), Pat Courtney Gold ( Wasco ) and Margaret Wood ( Navajo/Seminole ). This
        exhibition presents their work and documents its significance within the field of American
        Indian art. Their art reflects American Indian traditions of women&amp;#8217;s work. The
        exhibition&amp;#8217;s goal is to increase the knowledge, understanding and appreciation of
        the work of these artists among new audiences. This will be the first major exhibition on
        this subject at the Riverside Metropolitan Museum.</p>
       <p>Museum of Arts and Design in New York City will produce a catalog to accompany the
        exhibition &amp;#8220;Changing Hands 3: Art Without Reservation,&amp;#8221; highlighting
        100-150 new works by contemporary Native American artists. The series honors the
        centuries-old Native heritage of the visual arts as part of everyday life, yet challenges
        traditional stereotypes by presenting work by Native artists within the context of
        mainstream contemporary art, not as ethnographic artifacts. &amp;#8220;Changing
        Hands&amp;#8221; focuses on established and emerging artists who are interrogating their own
        traditions to extend artistic and cultural boundaries and, in doing so, formulating a new
        paradigm for contemporary Native American art theory and practice. The catalog, published by
        the Museum of Arts and Design, will contain a forward, a lead essay by the curators; essays
        by noted authorities, artists and critics; interviews with selected artists; and
        artists&amp;#8217; biographies and images.</p>
       <h3>Expressive Arts</h3>
       <p>The Expressive Arts recipients are the Cherokee National Theatre Company,
        CRIC/Coopdanza,Na Lei Hulu I Ka Wekiu/Patrick Makuakane and Dancing Earth Creations.</p>
       <p>Cherokee National Theatre Company&amp;#8217;s Rebecca Hobbs ( Cherokee ) and Roy Hamilton
        ( Cherokee ) will collaborate to compose 14 original songs and music to accompany a musical
        play, Nanyehi&amp;#8212;Beloved Woman of the Cherokee. The premiere of the play is planned
        for 2011 in the Cherokee Nation, with a goal of creating a traveling production. Nanyehi is
        the true story of Cherokee Beloved Woman, Nancy Ward. After her husband, Kingfisher, died in
        battle, she took up his fight and led the Cherokee to victory over the Creek tribe. She
        became a Warrior Woman, a Beloved Woman and a Cherokee leader. She advocated for peace
        during the American Revolutionary War era, corresponded with Thomas Jefferson and Benjamin
        Franklin and became a prominent figure in Cherokee history. Hobbs and Hamilton will
        collaborate to bring this historic and important story to the stage.</p>
       <p>CRIC/Coopdanza of the Bronx in New York City is co-producing The Return of the Condor,
        which is about the life and legacy of Manuel Quintin Lame, an indigenous Colombian rebel
        from the early 20th century. Coopdanza and Cristina Cortes will collaborate to produce an
        interdisciplinary performance art and dance-sound-video installation with pre-Columbian
        elements and contemporary atmosphere, which is referred to as chirimias, or spoken word and
        vocals in Native, Spanish and English languages.</p>
       <p>Na Lei Hulu I Ka Wekiu&amp;#8217;s Patrick Makuakane, a choreographer of this hula school
        based in San Francisco, will support the project Kapalakiko, a new dance theater work
        featuring specially commissioned chants and songs composed by Puakea Nogelmeier, a
        pre-eminent linguist and scholar of the Hawaiian language. Kapalakiko is Hawaiian for San
        Francisco, and the proposed suite of dances will be a celebratory exploration of the long
        historical connection between Hawai&amp;#8217;i and the city. Illustrated through the use of
        hula, chanting, storytelling and music, this theatrical dance creation is intended to
        advance the public dialogue about the experiences of America&amp;#8217;s indigenous peoples
        as it illuminates the ties that bind people together in a pluralistic society.</p>
       <p>Dancing Earth Creations of Santa Fe, N.M., will develop a site-specific, structured
        improvisation as the opening ceremony for its large-scale work, Of Bodies Of Elements.
        &amp;#8220;Invokation&amp;#8221; will serve to balance professional performance practices
        with functional ritual that serves as the root of Native dance and lies at the heart of
        Dancing Earth&amp;#8217;s creativity. The collaborative process will involve the
        choreographer, dancers and a live musical accompanist. Dancer/choreographer Rulan Tangen
        will work with indigenous collaborators to discover shapes and movement phrases that relate
        to the performers&amp;#8217; respective tribal heritages while also exploring the interplay
        between outdoors and indoors.</p>
       <p>Awards totaling $78,000 will support artists and cultural collaborations across the
        country. The museum received 38 applications requesting a total of nearly $500,000. The
        award recipients were selected by a panel of museum staff and outside experts in the
        contemporary art field. Visit the museum&amp;#8217;s website at www.AmericanIndian.si.edu
        this summer for information about next year&amp;#8217;s award applications and
        deadlines.</p>

        the first, free comprehensive guidebook focused solely on institutions of higher education
        who have demonstrated an above average commitment to sustainability in terms of campus
        infrastructure, activities and initiatives.</p>
       <p>Just in time for the 40th Anniversary of Earth Day (April 22nd), the Guide &amp;#8211;
        which is based on a survey of hundreds of colleges nationwide &amp;#8211; profiles the
        nation&amp;#8217;s most environmentally-responsible campuses. From solar panel study rooms
        to the percentage of budget spent on local/organic food, &amp;#8220;The Princeton
        Review&amp;#8217;s Guide to 286 Green Colleges&amp;#8221; looks at an
        institution&amp;#8217;s commitment to building certification using USGBC&amp;#8217;s LEED
        green building certification program; environmental literacy programs; formal sustainability
        committees; use of renewable energy resources; recycling and conservation programs, and much
        more.</p>
       <p>The free Guide can be downloaded at <a href="http://www.princetonreview.com/greenguide"
         >www.princetonreview.com/greenguide</a> and <a href="http://www.usgbc.org/campus"
         >www.usgbc.org/campus</a>.</p>
       <p>&amp;#8220;Students and their parents are becoming more and more interested in learning
        about and attending colleges and universities that practice, teach and support environmental
        responsibility,&amp;#8221; said Robert Franek, senior vice president and publisher of The
        Princeton Review. &amp;#8220;According to our recent College Hope &amp; Worries Survey, 64
        percent of college applicants and their parents said having information about a
        school&amp;#8217;s commitment to the environment would impact their decision to apply to or
        attend it. We created this Guide to help them evaluate how institutions like The Evergreen
        State College focus on environmental responsibility so that they can make informed decisions
        as they move through the college assessment and application process.&amp;#8221;</p>
       <p>Evergreen joins the ranks of outstanding universities and colleges nationwide that are
        leading the &amp;#8220;green&amp;#8221; movement through their own special programs and
        initiatives.</p>
       <p>&amp;#8220;Beyond the cost savings to an institution, even the simplest aspects of a green
        campus, such as increased use of natural light, have been found to improve student learning
        and quality of life,&amp;#8221; said Rick Fedrizzi, president, CEO and founding chair,
        USGBC. &amp;#8220;Green facilities make colleges more attractive to students and can
        dramatically reduce energy costs. Higher education is a top priority market segment for
        USGBC because graduates of green colleges become incredible drivers of change when they call
        for similar surroundings in their jobs and communities.&amp;#8221;</p>
       <p>The Princeton Review noted that another unique aspect of the Guide is that it provides
        important information on schools that have dedicated environmental studies curriculums.
        &amp;#8220;By many accounts, there are going to be a lot of job opportunities related to the
        environment and sustainability,&amp;#8221; commented Franek. &amp;#8220;For those who are
        interested in working in this growing sector, the Guide highlights the schools that are
        doing an especially good job in preparing and placing the next generation of green
        professionals.&amp;#8221;</p>
       <h3>How the Schools Were Chosen</h3>
       <p>The Princeton Review chose the 286 schools included in the Guide based on the
        &amp;#8220;Green Rating&amp;#8221; scores the schools received in summer 2009 when The
        Princeton Review published Green Rating scores for 697 schools in its online college
        profiles and/or annual college guidebooks. The Princeton Review&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8220;Green
        Rating&amp;#8221; is a numerical score from 60 &amp;#8211; 99 that&amp;#8217;s based on
        several data points. The Evergreen State College achieved a score of 99, the highest
        possible rating.
        http://www.usatoday.com/news/education/2010-04-20-greencolleges20_ST_N.htm</p>
       <p>In 2008, The Princeton Review began collaborating with USGBC to help make the Green Rating
        survey questions as comprehensive and inclusive as possible. Of 697 schools that The
        Princeton Review gave &amp;#8220;Green Ratings&amp;#8221; to in 2009, the 286 schools in the
        Guide received scores in the 80th or higher percentile. The Princeton Review does not rank
        the schools in this book hierarchically (1 to 286) or in any of its books based on their
        &amp;#8220;Green Rating&amp;#8221; scores.</p>

       <h2>Dr. Emoto to Present &amp;#8216;Messages from Water&amp;#8217; at The Evergreen State
        College and Lead Earth Week Blessing for the Salish Sea (Puget Sound)</h2>
       <p>Olympia &amp;#8211; April 21, the day before Earth Day, Dr. Masaru Emoto of Japan will
        gather with the public at 12:00 noon at the artesian well on Fourth Avenue, downtown
        Olympia, for a blessing of the water.</p>
       <p>Also on April 21, Dr. Emoto&amp;#8217;s seminar &amp;#8216;Message from Water&amp;#8217;
        will take place from 6:00 to 8:00 PM at The Evergreen State College Longhouse, followed by a
        book signing sponsored by The Evergreen State College Book Store. Local elders will share a
        blessing to honor the waters of the Salish Sea.</p>
       <p>Dr. Emoto will also lead a blessing for the healing of Salish Sea waters and water
        everywhere April 24, 2010, 11 AM to noon, as part of Earth Day events, while all around the
        Salish Sea people will participate simultaneously beside the sea or their local river.</p>
       <p>Dr. Emoto&amp;#8217;s bestselling book the <em>Hidden Messages in Water</em> has inspired
        people worldwide to rediscover their connection to water through viewing the photographs of
        water crystals exposed to words, photos, nature, and music.</p>
       <p>&amp;#8220;We are 70-90% water. What does this mean for the way we interact with each
        other? And what does this mean for the way we treat the rivers, lakes, and Salish Sea around
        us? Photos of water crystals made before and after blessing ceremonies for rivers and lakes
        have shown striking results, changing from ugly and ill-formed to beautiful and
        sparkling,&amp;#8221; said Pat Rasmussen, co-coordinator of the events.</p>
       <p>Dr. Emoto's visit will begin in Olympia, as part of Earth Day events throughout the
        region. "We want to generate awareness about the importance of the waters of our region, as
        well as the complex relationships between humans and the ecological diversity of the Salish
        Sea," said Rebecca Chamberlain, member of the faculty of the Evergreen State College. Dr.
        Emoto is traveling to the Northwest on the invitation of the Lummi Nation and local elders,
        as a way to raise awareness of our relationship to Puget Sound.</p>
       <p>Seminars by Dr. Emoto in Seattle at Seattle Unity April 22, Earth Day, and April 23 in
        Bellingham at Western Washington University Performing Arts Center and other regional events
        April 21-24 are being organized through the website at <a

       <h3>Evergreen Recognizes Need to Build Support for Returning Veterans through Policy and
        Practices</h3>
       <p>Veterans have suffered incalculable hardships and losses. College campuses throughout the
        country have a lot to learn from their experiences and also a lot to give back. Providing
        meaningful opportunities for higher education is a critical component of treating veterans
        well after service to their country, and a college degree is a step toward a better
        livelihood for many returning veterans.</p>
       <h4>A few facts from recent reports and headlines describe the current environment for
        veterans:</h4>
       <ul>
        <li><strong>More than one fifth of young war veterans are unemployed.</strong> Specifically
         the jobless rate for veterans from Iraq and Afghanistan wars ages 18 to 24 was 21.1 percent
         according to a recent report from the Department of Labor. In comparison, the rate for
         non-veterans in same age group was 16.6 percent. These rates for young veterans were
         significantly higher than the unemployment rate of young veterans in that age group in 2008
         (14.1 percent). For veterans of all ages returning from the recent wars, the unemployment
         rate in 2009 was 10.2 percent. [<a
          href="http://www.thenewstribune.com/2010/03/13/1107924/one-fifth-of-war-veterans-find.html"
          >1</a>]</li>
        <li><strong>Historically, younger veterans have had more difficulty than their older
          counterparts in finding a job.</strong> Younger veterans often have less training and job
         experience. Some joined the military right out of high school. [<a
          href="http://www.thenewstribune.com/2010/03/13/1107924/one-fifth-of-war-veterans-find.html"
          >2</a>] Higher Education provides an opportunity to address this situation.</li>
        <li>As of last year, <strong>1.9 million veterans had deployed for the Iraq or Afghan
          wars</strong> since the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. [<a
          href="http://www.thenewstribune.com/2010/03/13/1107924/one-fifth-of-war-veterans-find.html"
          >3</a>] According to information provided by the Servicemembers Opportunity Colleges of
         the American Association of State Colleges and Universities, the FY2010 defense budget
         authorizes more than 2.3 million service members.</li>
        <li><strong>One in three Iraq and Afghanistan veterans suffer from post-traumatic stress
          disorder, depression, a traumatic brain injury or some combination of the all
          three,</strong> according to a Rand Corporation study of 2008. [<a
          href="http://www.militarytimesedge.com/education/college-news/ed_treating_ptsd_110209w/"
          >4</a>] This indicates a critical need for colleges to prepare for the needs of incoming
         veterans.</li>
        <li>According to the US Department of Veterans Affairs June 2009 State Summary,
          <strong>there are more than 12,400 Washington veterans using GI Bill education benefits
          and more than 540,000 nationally.</strong> [<a
          href="http://www1.va.gov/opa/publications/factsheets/ss_washington.pdfhttp://www1.va.gov/opa/publications/factsheets/ss_washington.pdf"
          target="_blank">5</a>] Overall 70 percent of veteran students use education benefits
         according to information provided by Servicemembers Opportunities Colleges of the American
         Association of State Colleges and Universities.</li>
        <li><strong>The new GI Bill has increased the number of veterans and active duty service
          members who attend four year institutions and enroll full time.</strong> According to the
         Washington State Higher Education Coordinating Board (HECB) thousands of returning Iraq and
         Afghanistan war veterans are re-entering society as college and university students.
         According the HECB, the new college student pool is "perhaps the greatest influx of
         veterans since the Vietnam War." [<a href="http://www.hecb.wa.gov/veteransarticle.asp"
          >6</a>]</li>
       </ul>
       <h5>Policy and Practice Innovations at Evergreen</h5>
       <p>In an effort to fully understand the challenges and opportunities associated with
        increasing populations of veterans entering college, The Evergreen State College is
        organizing the first ever regional higher education summit on veteran&amp;#8217;s needs,
        experiences and retention. <a
         href="site://evergreen.edu - old design/events/veteranssummit/home">War and the Soul:
         Creating Healing Academic Communities for Our Nation&amp;#8217;s Veterans</a> is a training
        and networking conference for those in the higher education and military communities,
        featuring internationally renowned experts Edward Tick and Nancy Schiesari.</p>
       <p>At the event, which takes place May 6 and 7, participants will hear from Dr. Edward Tick,
        consultant, psychotherapist, and educator with three decades experience working with
        veterans. They will also work with Nancy Schiesari and discuss her film Tattooed Under Fire,
        a portrait of soldiers serving in Iraq and Afghanistan. Participants will also hear from
        student veterans about their experiences, explore strategies to better serve student
        veterans, exchange best practices with colleagues from across the region and share knowledge
        about resources available to students and institutions.</p>
       <p>This event is part of Evergreen&amp;#8217;s strategy to increase awareness and demonstrate
        support for veterans through events and policy innovations. The college has also launched a
        Veterans Support Working Group of students, staff and faculty, and a Student Veteran
        Organization. Evergreen&amp;#8211;with a student population approaching 4,900&amp;#8211;also
        recognizes its more than 100 veterans and 60 veteran dependents among its students, as well
        as the more than 60 veterans employed as faculty and staff. Annual events include a Fall
        Quarter Veterans Reception in which a Veterans Medallion is presented to all identified
        incoming veterans in recognition of their service, a tradition of celebration of Veterans
        Day for the past 15 years, and Memorial Day recognition efforts including distribution of
        some 2,000 Memorial Day poppies among a college population of some 5,600 (including
        students, faculty and staff.)</p>
       <p>Evergreen also aims to attract veterans and their dependents through outreach and tuition
        waivers year round for qualifying veterans and veterans&amp;#8217; dependents. Evergreen is
        a member of Servicemembers Opportunity Colleges and provides academic credit for military
        experience and training, as well as an option to earn credit while deployed through
        individual learning contracts. Approximately 65 dependents are receiving the 100% tuition
        waiver and approximately 50 veterans are receiving 50% tuition waivers.</p>
       <p>"We are giving increased attention to serving veterans well," says Art Costantino, vice
        president for student affairs at Evergreen. "We recognize that we are in one of the areas of
        the country that will experience an increase in veterans, we recognize what veterans provide
        for our campus, and we have a sense of responsibility to serve those who have served
        us."</p>
       <p>The sponsors for War and the Soul: Creating Healing Academic Communities for Our
        Nation&amp;#8217;s Veterans include The Evergreen State College Student Veterans
        Organization, Glidden Paint, NASPA Region V, The Evergreen State College President's
        Diversity Fund, Regional Education and Training Center, Squaxin Island Tribe, The Olympian,
        and the Washington State Department of Veterans Affairs.</p>

       <h2>Tree Canopy Researcher Honored for Public Service in Science</h2>
       <p>Nalini M. Nadkarni was recently named recipient of the prestigious 2010 National Science
        Board (NSB) Public Service Award as an individual who has made significant contributions in
        public understanding of science in the United States.</p>
       <p>"We are pleased to recognize Nalini for her outstanding and truly unique achievements in
        bringing her research to the public," said Steven Beering, NSB Chairman. "Not only has she
        been a leader in the forest canopy research field, but she has actively engaged in forging
        connections with the general public and involving non-traditional audiences in scientific
        research."</p>
       <p>The NSB Public Service Award honors individuals and groups that have made substantial
        contributions to increasing public understanding of science and engineering in the United
        States. These contributions may be from a wide variety of areas including mass media,
        education and/or training programs, entertainment, and non-profit and for-profit
        corporations.</p>
       <p>"I am honored by the recognition provided by the National Science Board," said Nadkarni.
        "I believe that the most critical problems facing society today are the widening gaps
        between humans and nature, and between science and society. Scientific researchers can
        &amp;#8211; and should &amp;#8211; play a role in the communication of science far beyond
        academia because of their passion and their knowledge of scientific topics."</p>
       <p>Nadkarni's work epitomizes a goal of the National Science Foundation, which is to support
        cutting edge research that has broader impacts on society. She says, "Communication with
        colleagues is a critical part of the scientific process. My work expands the definition of
        &amp;#8216;colleague&amp;#8217; to rap singers, modern dancers, and incarcerated people, who
        in turn provide fresh insights into the workings of nature. My vision is to turn public
        outreach by academics from burden to benefit."</p>
       <p>In January 2010, she was awarded a grant from the Ecosystems Program at NSF to initiate
        her "Research Ambassador Program", which will support her efforts to recruit and train other
        academic scientists to carry out non-traditional science outreach.</p>
       <p>Nadkarni has long made communication with the public an integral part of her work. In
        1994, she co-founded The International Canopy Network, a non-profit organization that
        fosters communication among researchers, educators, and conservationists. Her work
        consistently crosses disciplines and overcomes traditional boundaries, particularly by
        inviting artists to help distill and disseminate her work. In recent years, Nadkarni invited
        a hip hop singer and at-risk middle school students to her forest sites to write their own
        rap songs about nature, and collaborated with a modern dance company to create a dance
        production about rainforest conservation. She has appeared in numerous television
        documentaries, and was featured as a canopy scientist in a 2001 Emmy-award-winning National
        Geographic television documentary on tropical forest canopies.</p>
       <p>Nadkarni&amp;#8217;s work engages people with limited access to science education,
        including people in assisted living centers, military barracks, hospitals, and prisons. Her
        collaborative "Sustainable Prisons Project" with the Washington State Department of
        Corrections brings nature, science, and sustainability projects to incarcerated men and
        women. Inmates directly participate in conservation projects, including cultivation of
        threatened mosses, captive rearing of endangered Oregon Spotted Frogs, growing prairie
        plants for restoration, and raising rare butterflies &amp;#8211; all behind prison
        walls.</p>
       <p>Her colleagues are impressed with Nadkarni&amp;#8217;s accomplishments. "Few people in the
        world can boast both the scientific pedigree and the commitment to public service of Nalini
        Nadkarni," said Les Purce, President of The Evergreen State College. "Her desire to engage
        non-traditional audiences in scientific inquiry has taken her to prisons and churches,
        boardrooms and bookstores, public television programs and music recording studios, nail
        salons and tattoo parlors."</p>
       <p>Nadkarni is a Member of the Faculty at The Evergreen State College, in Olympia, WA, where
        she teaches environmental studies. She is also an Adjunct Associate Professor in the School
        of Forest Resources at the University of Washington, where she received her doctorate in
        1983. Her research is on the ecology of tropical and temperate forest canopies, focusing on
        the roles that canopy-dwelling plants play in whole forests. Her research in Washington and
        in Monteverde, Costa Rica is supported by the National Science Foundation and the National
        Geographic Society.</p>
       <p>Past individual recipients of the NSB Public Service Award include: Ira Flatow, Alan Alda,
        Bill Nye the Science Guy&amp;#174;; and Jane Goodall.</p>
       <p>Nadkarni will receive the NSB Public Service Award at the National Science Board Annual
        Awards Dinner at the U.S. Department of State in Washington, DC on May 4, 2010. Three
        additional award recipients will also be honored that evening: Bruce Alberts of the
        University of California, San Francisco, with the Vannevar Bush Award; The Expanding Your
        Horizons Network with the group NSB Public Service Award; and Subhash Khot of New York
        University with the Alan T. Waterman Award.</p>

       <h2>Convicting the Innocent: Why does it happen? How can we prevent it?</h2>
       <p>Exoneree Ronald Cotton and Jennifer Thompson-Cannino, co-authors of the New York Times
        Bestseller, PICKING COTTON: OUR MEMOIR OF INJUSTICE AND REDEMPTION, will speak twice in
        Tacoma on Thursday, March 4th at 10 a.m. &amp; 6 p.m. at The Evergreen State College Tacoma
        Campus, 1210 &amp;#8211; 6th Ave. Both events are free and open to the public.</p>
       <p>In 1984, Thompson-Cannino was raped at knifepoint by a man who broke into her apartment.
        She escaped and later identified Ronald Cotton as her attacker. He was convicted of the
        crime. But after 11 years in prison, a DNA test exonerated him.</p>
       <p>Thompson-Cannino and Cotton met two years later, became friends and worked together to
        write a book about their experiences, &amp;#8220;Picking Cotton: Our Memoir of Injustice and
        Redemption.&amp;#8221; They now travel the country talking with local communities about ways
        citizens, police and prosecutors can work together to prevent erroneous criminal
        convictions.</p>
       <p>The Tacoma events are part of the 2010 Norm Maleng Integrity of Justice Speakers Series.
        Co-sponsors include The Integrity of Justice Project, The Evergreen State College - Tacoma
        Campus, University of Washington School of Law, Seattle University School of Law, University
        of Washington - Tacoma Diversity Resource Center, University of Washington - Tacoma Social
        Work Program/Minor in Criminal Justice, University of Puget Sound African American Studies
        Program, Pierce College, Bates Technical College, Tacoma Community College, the Black
        Collective, the Tacoma Ministerial Alliance, The Conversation, Tacoma Urban League, and
        Catholic Community Services.</p>
       <p>The Integrity of Justice Project is a 501(c)(3) non-profit public policy and community
        education program working in partnership with Washington&amp;#8217;s law schools to identify
        and promote best practices that can help prevent erroneous criminal convictions.</p>

       <p>(Olympia, Washington) - The Evergreen State College&amp;#8217;s Ecovention Lecture series
        features a presentation by Paul Cereghino entitled &amp;#8220;Nearshore Ecosystem
        Restoration&amp;#8221; on Wednesday, February 24th from 6-8 p.m. in Evergreen&amp;#8217;s
        Seminar II Building, Room D1105. Mr. Cereghino will share his experience in regional
        restoration planning through his work with the Puget Sound Nearshore Ecosystem Restoration
        Project. He will discuss the recent removal of dikes to restore anadromous fish habitat to
        the historic Nisqually Estuary as one among a range of projects struggling to meet the
        challenges of restoring dynamic shorelines of Puget Sound.</p>
       <p>The lecture series &amp;#8220;Ecovention: Urban Horticulture and Ecological
        Restoration&amp;#8221; brings to campus innovative thinkers seeking to address various
        environmental challenges through creative approaches in horticulture, landscape
        architecture, ecological restoration, forestry and green commerce. The final presentation on
        March 10th will focus on student recommendations for Ecoventions on campus and beyond.</p>
       <p>Mr. Cereghino is a restoration ecologist with National Oceanic and Atmospheric
        Administration's Restoration Center, the only office within NOAA solely devoted to restoring
        the nation&amp;#8217;s coastal, marine, and migratory fish habitats. The Restoration Center
        works with a wide array of partners to restore mangrove, salt marsh, seagrass, oyster, coral
        reef, kelp forest, and river habitats.</p>
       <p>Ecovention events are free and open to the public. Parking is $2. For more information on

        States," that made him required reading.</p>

        <h3><img alt="Dan Mazur Photo" class="left"
          src="site://evergreen.edu/news/archives/images/danmazurphoto.jpg"/>About Dan Mazur</h3>
        <p>After reaching the summit of Mount Everest in 1991, Dan Mazur climbed six more of the
         world&amp;#8217;s 8,000 meter peaks and led expeditions more than 15 times to the
         world&amp;#8217;s highest. Mazur is a climb and trek leader with SummitClimb, now in its
         sixteenth year of organizing expeditions to Tibet, Nepal, China, Africa, Pakistan,
         Tajikistan, India and North America.</p>
        <p>Mazur is internationally recognized for the rescue of Australian climber Lincoln Hall on
         Mount Everest in May 2006. Hall had been left for dead the previous day after collapsing
         and failing to respond to treatment on descent from the summit. Mazur and his fellow
         climbers abandoned their own attempt on the summit in order to save Hall&amp;#8217;s
         life.</p>
        <p>When he is not climbing, Mazur travels the world giving presentations to raise money for
         charities such as the Mount Everest Foundation for Sustainable Development of Nepal and
         Tibet and the Mountain Fund. He is a member of the Alpine Club, a fellow of the Royal
         Geographical Society, a member of the American Alpine Club and a member of the British
         Mountaineering Council. As an accomplished climber, Mazur speaks about his firsthand
         experiences with the physical, mental and ethical challenges of climbing mountains.</p>
        <p>Mazur will speak at the Longhouse at The Evergreen State College at 7 p.m, February
         4.<br/> The college is located at 2700 Evergreen Parkway NW, Olympia.</p>
        <p>The event is free and open to the public.<br/>

          <strong>About the Willi Unsoeld Seminar</strong>
         </p>
         <p>The Willi Unsoeld Seminar Series brings to The Evergreen State College distinguished
          visitors who reflect the values and philosophy of Willi Unsoeld, a founding faculty
          member, philosopher, theologian and mountaineer. Beyond the Evergreen community, Unsoeld
          was well known for his first ascent of the West Ridge of Mt. Everest with Tom Hornbein, in
          which they made the first successful traverse of any Himalayan peak. For this feat,
          President John F. Kennedy presented them with the Hubbard Medal, The National Geographic
          Society's highest honor. The annual Willi Unsoeld Seminar is endowed as a "living
          memorial" in honor of Willi Unsoeld who lost his life in an avalanche on Mt. Rainier in
          1979.</p>

       <p>The Evergreen State College was recently awarded a gift of original Andy Warhol
        photographs from The Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts (<a
         href="http://www.warholfoundation.org">http://www.warholfoundation.org</a>).</p>
       <p>Evergreen Gallery was among 183 college and university art museums across the United
        States that each received a gift of 150 Warhol photographs through the Warhol
        Foundation&amp;#8217;s Photographic Legacy Program. By donating a significant number of
        Warhol photographs to each institution, the Legacy Program provides greater access to
        Warhol&amp;#8217;s artwork and process, and enables a wide range of people from communities
        across the country to view and study this important yet relatively unknown body of
        Warhol&amp;#8217;s work.</p>
       <p>The Evergreen State College has nurtured artistic photographic exploration since its
        founding in 1967. The 103 Polaroid and 50 black and white photographs by Warhol join more
        than fifty other photographs that form the heart of Evergreen&amp;#8217;s art collection.
        The collection includes photographs by Diane Arbus, Marsha Burns, Joanne Callis, John
        Divola, Judy Dater, Paul Caponigro, Ralph Gibson, Ralph Eugene Meatyard, Richard Misrach,
        Jerry Uelsmann, Brett Weston, Edward Weston, and others. Some of these photographs were
        featured in Evergreen Gallery&amp;#8217;s October exhibition, <em>Landscape Visions</em>,
        and two of the photographs by Misrach were on loan to the Henry Art Gallery in Seattle a
        year ago, for their exhibition <em>Richard Misrach: On the Beach</em>. The Warhol
        photographs will be displayed in Evergreen Gallery in future exhibitions.</p>
       <p>Other regional institutions that received the donation include Gonzaga
        University&amp;#8217;s Jundt Art Museum; Montana State University&amp;#8217;s Northcutt
        Steele Gallery; Douglas F. Cooley Memorial Art Gallery at Reed College; Southern Oregon
        University&amp;#8217;s Schneider Museum of Art; Jordan Schnitzer Museum of Art at the
        University of Oregon; the Henry Art Gallery at the University of Washington; and Washington
        State University&amp;#8217;s Museum of Art.</p>

       <p>The Evergreen State College Police Services Department and the Thurston County
        Sheriff&amp;#8217;s Department are continuing their joint investigation of a riot that
        occurred at Evergreen in the early morning hours of February 15 in which one police vehicle
        was destroyed and others damaged.<span>&amp;#160;</span> &amp;#8220;Based on the evidence,
        we will hold the people involved in the violence and destruction of property accountable for
        their actions,&amp;#8221; said Evergreen President Les Purce.</p>
       <p>The college convened a campus forum on February 19 to discuss the incident, answer
        questions and begin the process of addressing related issues.<span>&amp;#160;</span>
        Approximately 300 students, faculty and staff attended.<span>&amp;#160;</span></p>
       <p>&amp;#8220;The range of emotions I have gone through from just being flat sad, to
        disappointed to angry, to violated, have just swung back and forth in me,&amp;#8221; Purce
        explained, &amp;#8220;because I think about when you students first came to this campus, the
        promises we made to you and to your parents about what this place was and what we strive for
        it to be, and to have that kind of event occur in our house caused me great
        pause&amp;#8230;While we may never know everything about this event, one thing I know and we
        all have to know is that what happened is not acceptable by any standard.&amp;#8221;</p>
       <p>President Purce announced a moratorium on student-sponsored concerts and other events that
        involve substantial safety and security considerations until processes are improved.</p>
       <p>&amp;#8220;We aren&amp;#8217;t having any more concerts until we can get our house in
        order,&amp;#8221; Purce said. &amp;#8220;We have to ensure that we have the appropriate
        kinds of security and safety on campus and a revisiting of our policies as they relate to
        all aspects of approval of concerts, so that we can be assured that our house is
        safe.&amp;#8221;</p>
       <p>The college will convene a committee of students, faculty and staff to review policies and
        procedures for planning and implementing campus events. Recommendations will be forwarded to
        the Vice President for Student Affairs.</p>
       <p>As the group is being formulated and convened, Phyllis Lane, Dean of Student and Academic
        Support Services, in consultation with Art Costantino, Vice President for Student Affairs,
        will determine which events will be allowed in the short-term. While all events will be
        evaluated for security needs, college-sponsored lectures and art exhibits, for example, will
        continue as planned.</p>
       <p>Purce also repeated his intention that the college will pay for the damage to the Thurston
        County Sheriff&amp;#8217;s vehicle destroyed in the incident.</p>
       <p>At the forum, Evergreen Police Services officer April Meyers, who responded to reports of
        a fight at the concert and made an initial arrest, explained the timeline of events from her
        perspective. Others shared differing views of how the incident unfolded and expressed a
        broad range of concerns related to relationships with campus police, respect for diversity
        on campus and other issues of campus climate.</p>
       <p>The college will also refer this specific incident to its Police Services Community Review
        Board &amp;#8211; a body of students, faculty and staff charged with reviewing law
        enforcement issues and concerns on campus &amp;#8211; to assess the actions of Evergreen
        Police Services related to the incident.</p>
       <p>According to Costantino, Evergreen is planning a follow-up campus forum at 4 p.m. on
        Wednesday, February 27 in Lecture Hall 1 to continue discussion and begin the work to
        develop longer term strategies related to both to this incident and other issues of shared
        concern that affect safety and quality of life on campus.</p>

       </h3>
       <p>Our campus community is shocked and concerned by the violence that occurred following the
        Dead Prez concert at The Evergreen State College on Thursday, February 14. A large crowd had
        a confrontation with police after the arrest of a concert attendee who was suspected of
        assault. Two police cars were damaged, one severely. Some individuals, both in the crowd and
        among police, suffered minor injuries. The event was over by the early morning hours on
        Friday. Only a small proportion of students was involved in or directly affected by the incident.<br/>
        <br/> We have launched a police investigation to determine the facts and hold responsible
        parties accountable.<br/>
        <br/> This incident is not representative of the philosophy or character of The Evergreen
        State College. It not only runs counter to our values of respect and civility, it casts a
        shadow on the outstanding academic work of our students and faculty. Evergreen has earned a
        national reputation for academic excellence, innovative interdisciplinary education and
        alumni success in graduate school and careers. This event distracts from those successes.<br/>
        <br/> Evergreen Police Services is leading an investigation of the incident with support
        from the Thurston County Sheriff&amp;#8217;s Department. We will also be addressing the
        incident in a campus forum on February 19.</p>
       <p>

         Services at 360-867-6832.&amp;#160;</strong>

       <h3>Also First in State Approved to Offer New, Separate Middle Level Math and Middle Level
        Science Teaching Endorsements</h3>
       <p>(Olympia, Wash.)&amp;#160; The State of Washington Professional Educator Standards Board
        (PESB) voted unanimously on January 16 to reapprove the Master in Teaching Program (MIT) and
        the Professional Certificate Program at The Evergreen State College in Olympia.&amp;#160;
        Both programs were reapproved for five years based on demonstrated and even
        &amp;#8220;exemplary&amp;#8221; compliance with state standards.&amp;#160; The Board also
        approved Evergreen&amp;#8217;s request to offer the new, separate, more rigorous Middle
        Level Math and Middle Level Science endorsements which lead to being highly qualified to
        teach these subjects in grades four through nine.</p>
       <p>Evergreen&amp;#8217;s MIT program is the first teacher preparation program in the state to
        receive approval to offer these newly adopted endorsements.</p>
       <p>The PESB conducted an in-depth on-site evaluation and gave the Evergreen MIT program
        &amp;#8220;exemplary&amp;#8221; marks in more than half a dozen key areas including overall
        program design, quality and effectiveness of its Professional Education Advisory Board,
        field experience and clinical practices, collaboration with P-12 schools, experience working
        with diverse faculty, and recruitment, admission and retention, including outreach to and
        inclusion of students of color.</p>
       <p>In its accreditation report, the PESB noted praise for Evergreen&amp;#8217;s MIT program
        and students from local school districts.</p>
       <p>&amp;#8220;District administrators and school administrators lauded (Evergreen) MIT
        candidates&amp;#8217; abilities to work with all students due to their coursework and field
        experiences,&amp;#8221; the report noted.&amp;#160; &amp;#8220;In general, public school
        personnel find the extensive field experience exceptional. One principal commented that the
        two student teaching experiences that MIT candidates receive is
        &amp;#8216;paramount.&amp;#8217; When asked if she hires MIT students, she stated,
        &amp;#8216;I hire &amp;#8216;em like hotcakes!&amp;#8217;</p>
       <p>According to program director Sherry Walton, Evergreen&amp;#8217;s MIT graduates have an
        exceptional record of success in teaching.&amp;#160; &amp;#8220;Three of our students were
        honored as Outstanding (New or Young) Art Educator of the Year in 2006 and 2007, another was
        recognized as Outstanding Environmental Educator of the Year in 2003-04 and many more have
        been recognized for excellence in teaching and education.&amp;#8221;</p>
       <p>&amp;#8220;Our MIT program is not only producing exceptionally qualified teachers,
        we&amp;#8217;re also helping to fill specific needs in this state in high demand areas
        including math, science and English as a Second Language,&amp;#8221; noted Walton.</p>
       <p>Walton explained that the Evergreen MIT is a two-year, full-time program that leads to a
        master&amp;#39;s degree and Residency Certification.&amp;#160; She said it is aimed at
        people who have a bachelor&amp;#8217;s degree and want to become teachers.</p>
       <p>&amp;#8220;In the program, faculty and students work together to develop the knowledge and
        skills to effectively support the development of the diverse learners who attend our public
        schools.&amp;#160; We also have a unique emphasis on social justice and collaborative
        teaching and learning.&amp;#160; Our distinctive interdisciplinary approach produces
        teachers that are well grounded in educational theory and practice, including an
        understanding of a broad range of student learning styles and teaching
        approaches.&amp;#8221;</p>

        <em>$16,000 donation helps rebuild and expand greenhouses, reach conservation goals</em>
       </p>
       <p>Dining service provider ARAMARK is helping The Evergreen State College in its efforts to
        provide local, nutritious, and organic foods to students.</p>
       <p>From Purple Marconi Peppers to Patty-Pan Flying Saucer Squash, purchasing levels for
        inimitable and tasty, local and organic foods are growing with help from a $16,000 donation
        from the company. According to Sharon Goodman, director of residential and dining services
        at Evergreen, the college has already bested its goal for 2010 by purchasing more than 42
        percent of its food from local and organic sources.<span>&amp;#160;</span></p>
       <p>With completion of the new greenhouse structures and first planting in early February, it
        is likely that Evergreen could reach 47 percent production from local and organic sources,
        says Food Service Director, Craig Ward.<span>&amp;#160;</span></p>
       <p>Bringing the new green house structures online will also increase the economic potential
        of the organic farm and ecological agriculture efforts on campus. &amp;#8220;Basically, we
        are helping to develop another revenue stream for the farm,&amp;#8221; says Ward.
        &amp;#8220;The additional purchases we foresee in February should build income as well as
        assist in Evergreen&amp;#8217;s educational effort,&amp;#8221; he adds.</p>
       <p>Previous greenhouse structures were damaged by storms in December 2006.
        ARAMARK&amp;#8217;s contribution along with funds from the Federal Emergency Management
        Agency will mean replacement and expansion of greenhouse structures, meaning more square
        feet and increased projected supply for residential dining needs.</p>
       <p>By reducing transportation emissions, sourcing food locally also will likely contribute to
        The Evergreen State College&amp;#8217;s goal of reducing its carbon footprint and reaching
        climate neutrality by 2020.</p>
       <p>Dining services needs most of its produce October through June while the typical growing
        season here is June through October, says Melissa Barker, organic farm
         manager:<span>&amp;#160;</span> &amp;#8220;Using the greenhouses to extend the season is
        very important.&amp;#8221;</p>
       <p>&amp;#8220;It also allows for a year-round agricultural teaching space,&amp;#8221; adds
         Barker.<span>&amp;#160;</span> Evergreen offers instruction in organic agriculture on the
        organic farm.<span>&amp;#160;</span> The Evergreen State College&amp;#8217;s three-acre
        organic farm produces sustainable food for dining services, an on campus farm stand,
        Community Supported Agriculture efforts, local food banks and charities.</p>

       <p>Noted among TIME Magazine&amp;#8217;s 100 Most Influential People, Tyson is described as
        &amp;#8220;The Carl Sagan of the 21st century&amp;#8212;as long as you envision a Sagan
        who&amp;#8217;s muscular, African American, and as cool as his predecessor was
        geeky.&amp;#8221; In the same article, Tyson is referred to as &amp;#8220;the great
        explainer of all things cosmic.&amp;#8221;</p>
       <p>Dr. Tyson&amp;#8217;s latest book Death by Black Hole covers topics from astral life at
        the frontiers of astrobiology to the movie industry&amp;#8217;s less than perfect efforts to
        get its night skies right. Renowned for his ability to blend scientific knowledge,
        accessibility, and humor, Tyson is a natural teacher who simplifies some of the most complex
        concepts in astrophysics while sharing his infectious excitement for our universe.</p>
       <p>Dr. Tyson will speak on a wide range of topics familiar to audiences and readers,
        including the wonders of astronomy, science and math literacy, the connections between
        science and the humanities, civil discourse in regard to science, and other topics in
        science and society.</p>
       <p>The Unsoeld Seminar Series brings distinguished visitors to The Evergreen State College
        campus who reflect the values and philosophy of Willi Unsoeld, a founding faculty member,
        philosopher, theologian and mountaineer. Unsoeld was well known for his first ascent of the
        West Ridge of Mt. Everest with Tom Hornbein, in which they made the first successful
        traverse of any Himalayan peak. For this feat, President John F. Kennedy presented them with
        the Hubbard Medal, The National Geographic Society&amp;#39;s highest honor. The annual
        Unsoeld Seminar is endowed as a &amp;quot;living memorial&amp;quot; in honor of Willi
        Unsoeld who lost his life in an avalanche on Mt. Rainier in 1979. For more on Neil deGrasse

       <h3>Fans of science, ice cream and VOLCANIC ERUPTIONS will love the fifth annual Science
        Carnival set for May 30 and 31 from 10 am to 4 pm each day.</h3>
       <p>The Science Carnival is free and open to the public. The event offers hundreds of
        presentations from Evergreen science students with an emphasis on demonstration, hands-on
        participation and fun.</p>
       <p>This year, the Chemistry Club will attempt to make a giant baking soda and vinegar volcano
        erupt. The Kids in Chemistry event will feature ice-cream making and many other hands-on
        science experiments that will engage the imagination of school children. Participants can
        choose from as many as a dozen presentations at any given time. Each presentation lasts 30
        to 60 minutes and many popular topics will be repeated over the two days.</p>
       <p>Anyone with an interest in the physical world will enjoy the Science Carnival, the largest
        of its kind in Washington State. The popular event is great for middle and high school
        students, including home school students. Demonstrations will cover chemistry, physics,
        biology, astronomy, marine science, optics, health science, food science, computer science,
        and much more. In the spirit of interdisciplinary education -- a hallmark of the Evergreen
        learning experience, the event will include more than a dozen science-related art
        demonstrations in a wide range of media.</p>
       <p>###</p>
       <p>Science at Evergreen is taught by nationally and internationally recognized faculty - not
        graduate students - in small classes with hands-on opportunities for undergraduate research
        and access to sophisticated scientific equipment, including a scanning electron microscope
        and ultra-high-end analytical instruments.</p>
       <p>The Evergreen State College is a nationally recognized public liberal arts and sciences
        college known for its distinctive interdisciplinary curriculum, high level of
        student/faculty engagement and emphasis on putting learning into action</p>

       <p>On June 5, 2008, Evergreen will host a talk by Joel Salatin, a farmer, visionary and
        expert in the practice of sustainable agriculture. Salatin's Polyface Farm achieved iconic
        status as the livestock farm featured in the New York Times&amp;#8217; bestseller Omnivore's
        Dilemma by food writer Michael Pollan.</p>
       <p><strong>Date:</strong> Thursday, June 5, 2008<br/>
        <strong>Location:</strong> The Evergreen State College campus, Lecture Hall 1<br/>
        <strong>Time:</strong> 7 p.m.<br/>
        <strong>Cost:</strong> free</p>
       <p>A locally-sourced dinner dinner will be served from 5 - 7 p.m. at the Evergreen cafeteria,
        The Greenery, on the ground floor of the CAB.</p>
       <h4>About the Speaker:</h4>
       <p>A sought-after conference speaker, Salatin addressed a wide range of issues from "creating
        the farm your children will want," to "making a white collar salary from a pleasant life in
        the country."</p>
       <p>Salatin's speeches are both conviction-based and humorous, akin to theatrical
        performances, often receiving standing ovations. He describes his occupation as
        "mob-stocking herbivorous solar conversion lignified carbon sequestration
        fertilization."</p>
       <h4>Background:</h4>
       <p>In 1961, William and Lucille Salatin moved their young family to Virginia's Shenandoah
        Valley, purchasing the most worn-out, eroded, abused farm in the area. Using nature as a
        pattern, they began the healing and innovation that now supports three generations. Today
        the farm represents America's premier non-industrial food production oasis.</p>
       <p>This event is sponsored by Olympia Climate Action, Olympia Food Coop, Bainbridge Island
        Graduate Institute, Olympia Slow Food, and The Evergreen State College</p>

       <p>(Olympia, Wash.) Civil rights leader and colleague of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., Rev.
        James M. Lawson will be speaking at 7 p.m. on Monday, May 5 at Temple Beth Hatfiloh, 201 8th
        Ave SE in Olympia.&amp;#160; Rev. Lawson will talk about building a community that both
        values activism &amp;#8211; to promote better quality of life and greater equity among
        citizens &amp;#8211; and ensures civility and respect for the rights of all.&amp;#160; The
        event is free and open to the public.&amp;#160; It is sponsored by the City of Olympia, The
        Evergreen State College, The Hispanic Women&amp;#8217;s Network, Olympia Fellowship of
        Reconciliation, Olympia Movement for Justice and Peace, participating members of Olympia
        Port Militarization Resistance, The Port of Olympia, Unity in the Community, and Veterans
        for Peace.&amp;#160; For directions to the temple, visit
        http://www.bethhatfiloh.org/directions.html</p>
       <p>Lawson is a leading figure in the civil rights movement. On the eve of his assassination,
        Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. called Lawson &amp;quot;the leading theorist and strategist of
        nonviolence in the world.&amp;quot;</p>
       <p>Lawson, along with King, helped found the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee in
        1960. While a Vanderbilt Divinity School student in the early 1960s, he utilized nonviolent
        protests, in the tradition of Gandhi, in an effort to stop downtown Nashville segregation at
        lunch counters. As a result of his activities, Lawson was expelled from Vanderbilt.
        Thirty-six years after his expulsion, Vanderbilt honored Lawson with a Distinguished Alumnus
        Award for his actions.</p>
       <p>In 1961, Lawson coordinated the Freedom Ride, and was the advance staff person for the
        Birmingham campaign in 1963. He coordinated the Meredith march in Mississippi in 1966, and
        participated in the 1961-67 Chicago march efforts. Lawson served as president of the
        Southern Christian Leadership Conference for 14 years, and was chair of the strategy
        committee for the Memphis sanitation workers&amp;#8217; strike, which drew national
        attention. King was assassinated while supporting that effort.</p>
       <p>Lawson, a retired Los Angeles Methodist pastor, has remained outspoken and active in
        fighting for peace and against racism throughout his career. Rev. Lawson is a lifelong
        advocate for positive social change through nonviolent means and is currently a
        Distinguished Visiting Professor and Fellow at Vanderbilt University&amp;#8217;s Center for
        the Study of Religion and Culture. In Los Angeles, he hosted a weekly call-in show,
        &amp;quot;Lawson Live,&amp;quot; where he discussed social and human rights issues affecting
        minority communities. He spoke out against racism, and he challenged the Cold War and U.S.
        military involvement in Angola, Cuba, and Central America. Even after his retirement, Lawson
        protested with the Janitors for Justice in Los Angeles, and with gay and lesbian Methodists
        in Cleveland.&amp;#160;</p>

       <p>(Olympia, Wash.) For the traditional car enthusiast, the color red is red hot, but at
        Evergreen the best ride on campus comes with fewer emissions and more green.</p>
       <p>While the new electric vehicle is not necessarily sporty, sexy, or speedy, it is efficient
        and the right vehicle for Evergreen. The ZX40ST, the first street-legal electric vehicle to
        arrive on campus, is produced by Miles Electric Vehicles (http://www.milesev.com). The model
        ZX40ST work truck comes in white and carries up to 1,100 pounds with a top speed of around
        35 miles an hour.</p>
       <p>Mark Kormondy, grounds and motor pool manager at Evergreen sees the truck as &amp;#8220;a
        very convenient way to get into all locations on campus,&amp;#8221; as well as important
        means to produce fuel savings and not produce additional greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
       <p>Evergreen will introduce four more electric vehicles by the end of June says Paul Smith,
        director of facilities services. The additional electric cars will be financed in part with
        a grant from the Olympic Region Clean Air Agency (ORCAA).</p>
       <p>Executive Director of ORCAA Richard Stedman says that his organization&amp;#8217;s intent
        is to &amp;#8220;prime the pump to get some of these technologies out to institutions that
        can use them... rather than gas-powered or diesel-powered trucks and service
        vehicles.&amp;#8221;</p>
       <p>The college is considering more electric vehicles, capable of handling various loads and
        carrying more people to replace some of its gasoline vehicles, says Smith.
        &amp;#8220;We&amp;#8217;re evaluating the options now and we are hoping to add as many as
        five more electric vehicles within the next biennium,&amp;#8221; he adds. Smith says he sees
        the cars as part of a larger effort to &amp;#8220;further our goal of achieving carbon
        neutrality.</p>
       <p>With these larger goals in mind, operators of the unobtrusive white work truck are
        downshifting the carbon economy and turning heads. &amp;#8220;The car gets a lot of
        attention around here,&amp;#8221; says Kormondy &amp;#8220;even if it is almost totally
        silent.&amp;#8221;</p>

        <img alt="James Loewen" class="left"
         src="site://evergreen.edu/news/archives/images/jwluvm.jpg" title="James Loewen"/> A
        sociologist, historian and professor who taught race relations for 20 years at the
        University of Vermont, James Loewen co-authored, <em>Mississippi: Conflict and Change</em>,
        which won the Lillian Smith Award for Best Southern Nonfiction, but was not approved for use
        in the Mississippi school system because it was considered too controversial and placed too
        much focus on racial issues. This led to the lawsuit, Loewen v. Turnipseed, which was
        considered by the American Library Association to be a historic First Amendment Case, and
        one of the foundations of our &amp;#8220;right to read freely.&amp;#8221;</p>
       <p>Loewen&amp;#8217;s book, <em>Lies My Teacher Told Me: Everything Your High School History
         Textbook Got Wrong</em>, is based on his two-year study at the Smithsonian Institution of
        twelve American history textbooks. The book focuses on alleged errors or deliberate
        omissions in history textbooks but also on the lack of controversy that he claims would make
        learning history exciting. The book sold 800,000 copies and continues to inspire teachers to
        encourage students to challenge &amp;#8211; rather than memorize &amp;#8211; their
        textbooks.</p>

       <p>On June 14, 2008, Super Saturday, Washington State&amp;#8217;s largest one-day festival,
        celebrates 30 years at The Evergreen State College.<span>&amp;#160;</span> Live performances
        are one of the highlights of Super Saturday, and this year KAOS is taking that idea to
        downtown Olympia, in cooperation with the Olympia Film Society</p>
       <p>At 8:00pm, KAOS and OFS present Seattle&amp;#8217;s <em>PURE Cirkus</em> at the historic
        Capitol Theater in a night of daring delight; from the audacious to the
         exquisite.<span>&amp;#160;</span></p>
       <p>Tickets are $15 general admission, $10 for KAOS/OFS members, kids under 12 just $5.</p>
       <p>PURE Cirkus is a performance art and event production company that spans multiple genres
        and themes within the live entertainment and circus field.<span>&amp;#160;</span> Their
        productions focus on Corporeal storytelling and Variety acts merging elements of street
        performance, Cirque Noir or &amp;quot;Dark Cirkus&amp;quot;, live theater, circus acts,
        dance, burlesque, tribal art and live music, with more modern forms of performance such as
        grinder performance and fire manipulation.</p>
       <p>Featuring stunning costumes, height-defying stilt walkers and aerialists, illusionists,
        comical clowns, jaw dropping acts of demented bravery by the geeks, freaks and acrobats, the
        clash of both the macabre and mystical side of the three ring circus is brought to life
        through the human body as PURE Cirkus.</p>
       <p>Also performing, the <strong>Penny Dreadfuls</strong>, formerly known as Femme de
        Fabrique; and the music of <strong>Vince Brown and his Fish Tale Hoppin&amp;#8217; Barley
         Feetwarmers</strong>!<span>&amp;#160;</span> All freaks, geeks, and families
         welcome!<span>&amp;#160;</span> This fun time event is a fundraiser for the Olympia Film

       <p>The Evergreen State College recently harvested its first crop, arugula, from an organic,
        on campus, sponsored greenhouse. Storms in December 2006 damaged previous greenhouse
        structures on campus; ARAMARK, the dining services provider at Evergreen, donated $16,000
        that, along with funds from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, helped to rebuild and
        expand the greenhouses, dubbed The Organic Farm. The first morning&amp;#8217;s harvest
        produced nearly 40lbs of arugula, which was prepped and served that very day during
        lunch.</p>
       <p>&amp;#8220;Students at Evergreen want to know where their food is coming from. Campus
        Dining support of the organic farm is an impressive step towards increasing our local food
        production,&amp;#8221; said Sharon Goodman, director of residential and dining services at
        The Evergreen State College. &amp;#8220;The arugula that I helped picked one morning was on
        the salad bar in the dining hall by lunch time. It felt great to tell students that I had,
        first-hand, harvested the arugula that very day and that it was fresh, local, organic, and
        was grown for us to all enjoy. It made me and reminded me that Evergreen really is a special
        place.&amp;quot;</p>
       <p>The new greenhouses offer more square feet and increased projected supply for residential
        dining needs. Additionally, the structures have also increased the economic potential of the
        organic farm and ecological agriculture efforts on campus. To date, the college has already
        bested its goal for 2010 by purchasing more than 25%-30% percent of its food from local and
        organic sources. &amp;#8220;With the new greenhouse structures, it is likely that Evergreen
        could reach 32%-37% percent production from local and organic sources,&amp;#8221; said Craig
        Ward, food service director at The Evergreen State College.</p>
       <p>&amp;#8220;Dining services needs most of its produce October through June while the
        typical growing season in Olympia is June through October,&amp;#8221; said Melissa Barker,
        manager at The Organic Farm. &amp;#8220;Using the greenhouses to extend the season is very
        important.&amp;#8221;</p>
       <p>&amp;#8220;It also allows for a year-round agricultural teaching space,&amp;#8221; added
        Barker. Evergreen offers instruction in organic agriculture on The Organic Farm. The
        Evergreen State College&amp;#8217;s three-acre organic farm produces sustainable food for
        dining services, an on-campus farm stand, Community Supported Agriculture efforts, local
        food banks, and charities</p>

        <em>Researchers Work with Natural Enemies of Bacteria to Deter Prevalent Pathogen on Farms
         and Feedlots</em>
       </p>
       <p>Researchers at The Evergreen State College in collaboration with the U.S. Department of
        Agriculture at Texas A&amp;#38;M have been working to increase food safety by reducing the
        populations of E. coli in the guts of sheep and cattle. The goal of the research is to
        increase understanding of the complex predator-prey relationship between bacteria (the prey)
        and bacteriophages (the viral predator). The research could lead to safer food.</p>
       <p>E. coli O157:H7 is a dangerous bacterial food pathogen that occurs naturally in the guts
        of livestock without making them sick. E. coli is easily passed from farm animals to humans.
        The bacterium causes food poisoning, sickness, and sometimes death in people who eat tainted
        meat or contaminated produce or water.</p>
       <p>Andrew Brabban and Betty Kutter, microbiologists at Evergreen State College in Olympia,
        Washington, have been studying tiny E. coli predators known as bacteriophages, which attack
        E. coli bacteria. The Evergreen State phage biology lab was established in 1973 and together
        Kutter and Brabban have more than six decades of research experience on phages.</p>
       <p>Brabban, Kutter, and colleagues have uncovered bacteriophages that attack various strains
        of E. coli naturally in cattle or sheep&amp;#8217;s stomach. Recent results appeared under
        the title &amp;#8220;Prevalence of Escherichia coli O157 and O157:H7-infecting
        bacteriophages in feedlot cattle feces&amp;#8221; in the October issue of Letters in Applied
        Microbiology. The research is funded by the U.S. National Institutes of Health, Phage
        Biotics, the National Cattlemen&amp;#8217;s Beef Association and the U.S. Department of
        Agriculture.</p>
       <p>By using phage as a natural predator, it may be possible to better target and tame E. coli
        and increase the safety of food. Using bacteriophages provides a potentially cheap and
        broadly applicable way to treat cattle that offers advantages over traditional
        antibiotics.</p>
       <p>Phage treatment is more specific to E. coli, which means it is less likely to encourage
        resistance in other harmful bacteria and less likely to kill useful bacteria. Also, much
        like the bacteria, the bacteriophage is easily transferred from one infected individual to
        another, resulting in a more robust solution to E. coli infections.</p>
       <p>Economic impacts could also be significant. &amp;#8220;E. coli contamination results in
        waste of meat, and ultimately wasted meat costs consumers,&amp;#8221; says Brabban.
        &amp;#8220;Hundreds of millions are also spent to treat E. coli infections,&amp;#8221; he
        adds.</p>
       <p>But while economics are important, healthier food is the top priority of the research.
        &amp;#8220;It would be very rewarding if we could come up with an increased understanding or
        an application that leads to safer food down the line,&amp;#8221; says Brabban.
        &amp;#8220;We all would like food to be safer.&amp;#8221;</p>

       <h2>Grants Awarded to Increase College Readiness and Postsecondary School Success among
        Native Students</h2>
       <p>
        <em>Nearly $1 Million given by Bill &amp;#38; Melinda Gates Foundation, the National Science
         Foundation and the Lumina Foundation to Support Partnership for Native Student Success at
         Muckleshoot Tribal College.</em>
       </p>
       <p>Olympia, Wash. &amp;#8211; The Partnership for Native American College Access and
        Success&amp;#8212;a collaboration of five Washington state higher education
        institutions&amp;#8212;has received $292,000 from the Gates Foundation, $195,000 from the
        Lumina Foundation and nearly $500,000 from the National Science Foundation to strengthen
        postsecondary curriculum for Native students in Washington and create a clear pathway to a
        bachelor&amp;#8217;s degree for Native Americans in Muckleshoot and Tulalip communities.</p>
       <p>Grants from the Gates Foundation and the Lumina Foundation will support the two-year
        effort, which began in June 2008. The work builds upon ongoing work through The Evergreen
        State College&amp;#8217;s Enduring Legacies Project, which established the initial
        partnership between Evergreen and Grays Harbor College to serve reservation-based students.
        That project also developed teaching resources and culturally relevant curriculum in the
        form of case studies on key issues in Indian country.</p>
       <p>The partnership includes Antioch University, The Evergreen State College, Grays Harbor
        College, Muckleshoot Tribal College, and Northwest Indian College. It will use lessons
        learned in the process to suggest a policy agenda to improve preparation for college and
        seek greater public investment in postsecondary education for Native students in Washington.
        A report on Indian education in Washington will be produced for wide distribution under
        these grants. Among other things, the new report will provide up-to-date information on
        programs available to serve Native students across the state.</p>
       <p>According to Michelle Aguilar-Wells, co-director on the grants and director of
        Evergreen&amp;#8217;s Reservation-Based Community-Determined Program, the project represents
        an unusually deep partnership between institutions. &amp;#8220;What brings us
        together,&amp;#8221; she says, &amp;#8220;is our commitment to high-quality education for
        Native students.&amp;#8221; Antioch University has offered the only Native teacher education
        program in the state at Muckleshoot Tribal College for some years. In the fall, Antioch will
        expand the graduate programs offered. &amp;#8220;Evergreen provides a strong program leading
        to a bachelor&amp;#8217;s degree that prepares students for various careers in public
        service within or outside of tribal communities,&amp;#8221; says Aguilar-Wells. Northwest
        Indian College and Grays Harbor College provide the foundational lower-division coursework
        with Grays Harbor College emphasizing online courses. &amp;#8220;By working
        together,&amp;#8221; adds Aguilar-Wells, &amp;#8220;we can strengthen all of our
        programs.&amp;#8221;</p>
       <p>&amp;#8220;We have been developing strong and diverse programs through partnerships since
        our start in 1996,&amp;#8221; said Louie Gong, educational resource coordinator at
        Muckleshoot Tribal College. &amp;#8220;But these new grants will take the concept of
        partnership to a whole new level,&amp;#8221; he adds.</p>
       <p>One of the innovations that will begin in the fall is a joint writing center that students
        in all of the different programs can use. &amp;#8220;There&amp;#8217;s just nothing like
        this elsewhere, and we&amp;#8217;re really excited about it,&amp;#8221; adds Gong.</p>
       <p>Cheryl Crazy Bull, president of Northwest Indian College, said that the project provides
        many opportunities for their tribal college. &amp;#8220;We will be exploring new approaches
        to education, especially in the first year of college, which is so critical to student
        success. And we will also be looking at how to improve inter-institutional advising and
        administrative functions from a student and tribal point of view.&amp;#8221;</p>

       <p>Evergreen State College Organic Farm is the first college farm to receive Salmon-Safe
        certification, an emerging Northwest eco-label to recognize agricultural practices that
        protect water quality, fish and wildlife habitat, and native biodiversity.</p>
       <p>&amp;#8220;Being only a mile from Puget Sound, we take great pride in our environmental
        farming practice&amp;#8221;, says Melissa Barker, Evergreen Farm Manager. &amp;#8220;As a
        regional certification program, Salmon-Safe offers us independent verification that we are
        meeting our environmental goals and will help us communicate that to our students and the
        greater community&amp;#8221;.</p>
       <p>The Evergreen Farm was determined to be Salmon-Safe in the programs&amp;#8217; six main
        categories: protecting waterways and wetlands, preventing soil erosion, conserving water
        through irrigation efficiency, minimizing impacts from animals, using natural weed and pest
        control methods in lieu of toxic chemicals, and promoting on-farm biodiversity.</p>
       <p>&amp;#8220;The Evergreen Farm serves as a valuable resource for student involvement in
        organic agriculture and sustainable farming practices&amp;#8221; says Larry Nussbaum of
        Stewardship Partners, the organization coordinating the Salmon-Safe program in Washington.
        &amp;#8220;As the first college farm to be Salmon-Safe certified, Evergreen will serve as a
        working model to educate the public about both environmental farming practices and credible
        third-party eco-labeling programs.</p>
       <p>The Salmon-Safe program was founded in Oregon in 1997 and has since been recognized as one
        of the most reliable eco-labels in the country, alongside other well known labels such as
        Certified Organic and Fair Trade. Stewardship Partners, a non-profit conservation
        organization, launched the program in Washington in 2004 and is working with farmers in
        across a variety of sectors including vineyards, orchards, dairies, and row crops. Over 150
        farms in Oregon and 50 farms in Washington have been certified Salmon-Safe.</p>

       <p>A mountain of school supplies. $12,202 in cash donations. That&amp;#8217;s what listeners
        to alumni-owned and operated Mixx 96.1 KXXO radio in Olympia gave to the station&amp;#8217;s
        annual &amp;#8220;Little Red Schoolhouse Project&amp;#8221; School Supplies Drive in August,
        and every bit of it went toward supplying the back-to-school needs of low-income families in
        Thurston County at the group&amp;#8217;s free distribution day at Jefferson Middle School on
        Olympia&amp;#8217;s Westside.</p>
       <p>The Little Red Schoolhouse (LRS) Project had been in existence for seven years in 1998
        when organizers, from groups as disparate as Junior League of Olympia, Capital Mall (now
        Westfield Capital), St. John&amp;#39;s Episcopal Church and the Community Action Council
        made a desperate plea for supplies over Mixx 96.1&amp;#8217;s airwaves. The response from
        listeners was immediate, and it spurred Mixx 96.1 KXXO co-owner and station manager Toni C.
        Holm (Evergreen, 1979) to action. In 1999, the station initiated an all-day radio marathon
        broadcast from outside the station&amp;#8217;s Rockway-Leland Building studios at the corner
        of State and Washington in the heart of downtown Olympia.</p>
       <p>Listeners responded enthusiastically from the beginning and 10 years later, LRS is able to
        help more kids than ever before, providing them with the school supplies, clean clothing,
        calculators, and backpacks needed for school. Holm herself has been in the trenches from
        then on, serving on the LRS board and, since instituting a workout routine some years ago,
        doing much of the heavy lifting for the group. (This may surprise some of her fellow alumni
        from her days at KAOS where she needed help to pick up anything over 10 pounds.)</p>
       <p>
        <em>&amp;quot;When we start the drive, we never know what&amp;#39;s going to
         happen.&amp;quot; Holm says. &amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s a completely grassroots effort, with
         people responding to help other people, all locally. Yet in a year when everyone is feeling
         the pinch economically, our community responded more generously than ever with over $12,000
         and a ton of supplies. We have a big horn to reach people and I love that we can put it to
         use in this way. There are going to be lot of happy kids with new backpacks &amp;#38;
         supplies this year! We live in a great community!&amp;quot;</em>

        mailed to: P.O. Box 6302, Olympia, WA 98507. Please call Community Action Council,

       <p>While no one survey captures quality in higher education, Evergreen is appearing
        consistently on top national lists. The college ranks highly among national and West Coast
        schools in, &amp;#8220;America&amp;#8217;s Best Colleges 2009&amp;#8221; by US News and
        World Report. According to the annual survey of America&amp;#8217;s colleges and
        universities, The Evergreen State College is among the top schools ranked in its category
        &amp;#8220;Best Universities-Master&amp;#8217;s-West,&amp;#8221; a grouping that indicates
        colleges with masters&amp;#8217; and bachelors&amp;#8217; programs but without doctorate
        programs. Evergreen landed in the top 25 on this measure. For more on this ranking, visit:
         <a href="http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/college/items/8155"
         >http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/college/items/8155</a>.</p>
       <p>US News and World Report also included The Evergreen State College as a Top College in the
        West and noted the national reputation of its learning communities and service learning
        programs. Evergreen ranked highly overall and was featured in the section, A+ Schools for B
        Students, a grouping for colleges that look beyond grades to other indicators of student
        success, also described as schools with &amp;#8220;first rate programs and strong
        reputations.&amp;#8221;</p>
       <p>Evergreen is among The Best 368 Colleges selected by The Princeton Review. In addition to
        recognizing Evergreen&amp;#8217;s academic quality, Evergreen scored well on The Princeton
        Review&amp;#8217;s new Green rating&amp;#8212;a measure of environmentally-related
        practices, policies and course offerings. The Evergreen State College scored a nearly
        perfect &amp;#8220;green rating&amp;#8221; of 98 of a possible 99. More information is
        available here: <a href="http://www.princetonreview.com/college-rankings.aspx?uidbadge=%07"

         >http://www.princetonreview.com/green/press-release.aspx?uidbadge=%07</a>.</p>
       <p>Sierra magazine, a publication of the Sierra Club, named Evergreen as one of the
        nation&amp;#8217;s top 10 &amp;#8220;coolest&amp;#8221; schools for its efforts to address
        global warming and engage the campus in environmental conservation. Sierra&amp;#8217;s list,
        &amp;#8220;10 That Get It,&amp;#8221; shows that schools of all sizes are taking action on
        global warming. Top schools earned points for policies in 10 categories: buildings, energy,
        food, investment, procurement, transportation, curriculum, environmental activism, waste
        management and overall commitment to sustainability. A perfect score in every category would
        give a school 100 points. Evergreen ranked No. 5 with a score of 88. More information is

       <p>The Evergreen State College Center for Community Based Learning and Action received a
        $41,750 grant from Learn and Serve America and Washington Campus Compact to facilitate
        discussions between local higher education institutions to support community-based service
        learning in our area. The goal is to discuss critical issues and build coalition to meet
        critical community needs.</p>
       <p>The project launched a service learning gathering Monday August 11 at The Evergreen State
        College. Participants from St. Martins, South Puget Sound Community College, Olympic,
        Centralia, Green River, and Clark Colleges joined Evergreen faculty and staff to investigate
        poverty and flood relief issues. Local organizations POWER (Parents Organized for Welfare
        and Economic Rights) and Lewis County Long Term Recovery Organization presented compelling
        stories of families struggling with poverty and communities affected by December 2007
        floods.</p>
       <p>This network of service learning efforts at seven local colleges will strengthen our
        regional ability to contribute to making our community better. The project plans to share
        the story of the power of student learning that makes a difference.</p>

       <p>(Olympia, Wash.) Thirteen community organizations in the South Sound will get a helping
        hand on September 24 as more than 150 incoming students at The Evergreen State College start
        their educational experience with a day of volunteer work for community causes. According to
        Ellen Shortt-Sanchez, director of Evergreen&amp;#8217;s Center for Community-Based Learning
        and Action (CCBLA), projects in the college&amp;#8217;s Community to Community Action Day
        are aligned with Hunger Free Thurston County Coalition&amp;#8217;s goal to make our county
        Hunger Free. Project range from harvesting vegetables from community farms for the local the
        food bank, to restoring salmon habitat and building low income housing. Students will ride
        InterCity transit buses, bikes and college vans to local sites to pitch in and help for the
        afternoon before they get settled at college.</p>
       <p>&amp;#8220;Evergreen has a rich tradition of contributions to the local
        community,&amp;#8221; explained Shortt-Sanchez. &amp;#8220;Community to Community Action Day
        has been connecting Evergreen students to local groups working for community needs for 18
        years. The event provides a community service &amp;#8211; it&amp;#8217;s expected to provide
        more than 1000 hours of service this year alone &amp;#8211; and a learning experience for
        students new to the college. They get to know their community, understand its needs a little
        better and reflect on the positive contributions they can make.&amp;#8221;</p>
       <p>Students from Evergreen&amp;#8217;s Community Connections college transition program will
        be participating in Community to Community Action Day as a required part of their
        coursework. Academic programs are supported to integrate service learning by a grant from
        Learn and Serve.</p>
       <p>&amp;#8220;The organizers of Community Connections have been working closely with the
        CCBLA on this event,&amp;#8221; explained Evergreen faculty member Elizabeth Williamson.
        &amp;#8220;We feel that helping students make a connection to the world beyond the campus is
        absolutely essential to helping them begin to put theory into practice, and we hope it will
        set an important precedent for them as they continue their work at Evergreen.&amp;#8221;</p>
       <p>Campus housing residents from Evergreen&amp;#8217;s Green Living and Sustainability House
        &amp;#8211; who choose to live with other students dedicated to helping their community and
        living sustainably &amp;#8211; will participate as well.</p>
       <p>Shortt-Sanchez said that, in addition to a wide range of student volunteer activities,
        during the last academic year Evergreen students contributed over 19,000 hours of community
        work through the Students in Service Americorps program. Students in Service is a program of
        the Washington Campus Compact. Community minded student workers receive tuition awards as
        recognition for community action. This provides the chance for students to integrate their
        studies with community service and to be compensated.</p>
       <p>Community members are welcome to work alongside Evergreen students on Community to
        Community Action Day. For more information on volunteering, contact Ellen Shortt-Sanchez at
        360-867-6859 by Monday Sept 22, 2008.</p>

       <p>Steven Tice, Certified Trauma Specialist with 19 years of experience as a program director
        and therapist in Veteran Administration programs will deliver the keynote address at The
        Evergreen State College Veterans Day Commemoration on November 11 at the college&amp;#8217;s
        Olympia campus, Seminar 2 Building, Room A 1105 at 3:30 PM.</p>
       <p>Tice will speak on the theme of this year&amp;#8217;s event Thanking Those Who Serve,
        providing insights into life after the traumatic experience of combat. College officials
        will also unveil a new Evergreen Veterans Medallion, which will be presented to Evergreen
        students, staff and faculty who have served in the U.S. armed services at a ceremony later
        in the academic year.</p>
       <p>Severely wounded in one of the most horrific battles of the Vietnam War, Hamburger Hill,
        Tice has been called a National Treasure for his work to help veterans through their
        experience of war and recovery. His personal story of familial stress, increasing
        recognition of lasting effects of war and work at reconciliation with the past provides an
        inspiring story to anyone who wishes to better understand the lives of veterans today.</p>
       <p>Since retiring from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs in December 1998, Tice has
        been writing, consulting and presenting on PTSD treatment, as well as providing direct
        clinical treatment with physically disabled combat veterans from WWII to the current wars in
        Iraq and Afghanistan.</p>
       <p>Steven&amp;#39;s therapeutic approach is to treat PTSD as an emotional malady and not a
        mental illness. In Tice&amp;#8217;s view, symptoms of PTSD are expectable outcomes when
        individuals participate in or are exposed to traumatic events outside the norm of human
        experience.</p>
       <h4>About Steven Tice</h4>
       <p>Steven Tice, MA, CTS received his Master of Arts degree in 20th Century US Social History
        from the University of Nevada, Las Vegas in 1981, and his Bachelor of Arts degree in
        Secondary Education from UNLV in 1976. He has been certified as a trauma specialist through
        the international Association of Traumatic Stress Specialists since 1992. Steven is a
        Washington State Registered Counselor.</p>

       <p>Evergreen Gallery at The Evergreen State College is sponsoring a project by environmental
        artist Basia Irland. The artist will be on campus October 21-27 to talk about her art and
        encourage people to participate in her project &amp;#39;A Gathering of Waters.&amp;#39; The
        grass-roots participatory project about the Nisqually River connects people and focuses
        attention on finding ways to protect and honor our rivers. Irland&amp;#8217;s illustrated
        lectures will be Tuesday October 21, 4 pm in Lecture Hall 1 and Wednesday October 22, 10 am
        in the Recital Hall, Communications Building.</p>
       <p>&amp;#39;A Gathering of Waters&amp;#39; explores the effect of human controls and demands
        on rivers and celebrates the people who work to conserve river resources. Irland&amp;#8217;s
        first Gathering project, begun in 1995, was conceived as a symbolic carrying of Rio
        Grande/Rio Bravo&amp;#39;s waters from source to sea, to re-establish people&amp;#39;s
        connection with the river and with each other along its 1,875 mile length.
        Irland&amp;#8217;s new project focuses on the Nisqually River - the only river in the United
        States that begins within a National Park and ends in a National Wildlife Refuge. Basia
        Irland, Professor Emerita, University of New Mexico, Department of Art and Art History has
        created other &amp;#8220;Gatherings&amp;#8221; in New Mexico, Colorado, Canada and
        England.</p>
       <p>This project is generously supported by a gift from the Tom Rye Harvill Award.</p>
       <p>Irland will be available to answer the public&amp;#8217;s questions at her illustrated
        lectures on Tuesday October 21, 4 pm in Lecture Hall 1 and Wednesday October 22, 10 am in
        the Recital Hall, Communications Building.</p>

       <p>Evergreen Professor Jack Longino joined a team of researchers in publishing a report in
        the October 9 issue of Science. The article, Global Warming, Elevational Range Shifts, and
        Lowland Biotic Attrition in the Wet Tropics examines the impact of global warming in the wet
        tropics &amp;#8211; an area encompassing a large fraction of the planet. The authors study
        new data on plants and insects, evaluating projections for global warming and what this will
        mean for species. The authors conclude that tropical lowland areas may face a distinct
        attrition of species and that many species in the area under study will face declining
        habitat under climate change scenarios, particularly in the lowlands of Costa Rica.</p>
       <p>John &amp;#8220;Jack&amp;#8221; Longino, a nationally recognized specialist in Neotropical
        Myrmecology, the scientific study of ants, joined researchers from the University of
        Connecticut, the Friedrich-Schiller Universitaet of Jena, Germany; and the University of
        California in providing this analysis. The Neotropic zone includes more tropical rainforest
        than any other ecozone, extending from southern Mexico through Central America and northern
        South America to southern Brazil, including the Amazon rainforest. This geographic area
        contains the vast majority of terrestrial biological diversity.</p>

       <p>The Evergreen State College has recently adopted the e2Campus emergency notification
        system that enables the school to send urgent news via text-messaging to your cell phone
        and/or email.</p>
       <p>The service is available to all current students, faculty and staff of The Evergreen State
        College.</p>
       <p>Once you sign up for the service, the school can text your cell phone and/or email with
        timely information about emergencies and school closures (no general or non-urgent
        messages). This replaces the prior FlashAlert system, so if you want these notifications,
        you will need to sign up for e2Campus.</p>
       <p>Depending on your personal cell phone plan, there may be a nominal fee from your carrier
        to receive text messages, but there is no charge from the school to use the service.</p>
       <p><strong>To sign up, go to</strong>
        <a href="http://www.evergreen.edu/emergencypreparedness"
         >http://www.evergreen.edu/emergencypreparedness</a><br/> (and see additional directions
        below to help guide you through the simple registration process).</p>
       <p>While the introduction of e2Campus is designed to improve on past emergency communication
        systems, no single system can guarantee the ability to reach all subscribers in all
        circumstances. We are working on further improvements for on-campus communication in case of
        emergency. Here are some other resources for information on weather delays and closures.</p>
       <h4>Additional Information Sources Campus Closures/Weather Delays</h4>
       <p>Evergreen Web site: <a href="http://www.evergreen.edu">www.evergreen.edu</a><br/>
        Evergreen switchboard: 360-867-6000 (press 1 for operating status of the Olympia
        campus).<br/> Radio: KGY/1240 AM (Olympia); 1320 AM (Aberdeen); 1170 AM (Centralia); 1030 AM
        (Shelton); KIRO 710 AM; KOMO 1000 AM</p>
       <p>Evergreens&amp;#8217; Tacoma campus follows Tacoma School District decisions (see <a
         href="http://www.tacoma.k12.wa.us/information/Pages/SchoolClosures.aspx"
         >http://www.tacoma.k12.wa.us/information/Pages/SchoolClosures.aspx</a>)</p>
       <p>Weather conditions in Washington can vary widely from location to location. Students,
        faculty and staff should always evaluate the conditions where they are and make their own
        decisions about travel.</p>
       <h4>Steps to register for e2Campus alerts:</h4>
       <ol>
        <li>Visit: <a href="http://www.evergreen.edu/emergencypreparedness"
          >www.evergreen.edu/emergencypreparedness</a></li>
        <li>If you prefer *to receive emails only*, proceed to the link, Click Here To Sign Up Using
         EMAIL Only under the Create Account button. Otherwise create a username and enter email and
         cell phone number. Additional options for RSS readers, additional emails, etcetera will be
         available on successive pages after you create your account.</li>
        <li>After you create your account, watch your email and/or cell phone for verification
         messages designed to ensure correct and reliable communications to phones and email
         addresses.</li>
        <li>With email: it is particularly important to check that the resulting message did not
         enter your junk email folder, and to add the email address to your safe list if it did. Due
         to the variety of security levels associated with email accounts, networks, spam filters,
         and computer systems, this step is crucial to ensure an open channel for emergency
         messages. In Microsoft Outlook, for example, if you do not receive a verification message
         in a few minutes, please check the junk email folder. To do this, right-click on the
         message from e2campus@omnilert.net and choose . The procedure for safe-listing messages
         will vary with different email systems and networks.</li>
       </ol>
       <p>Cell phones will receive a verification code via text message that you enter into the Web
        site ensuring that your phone received the test message and can therefore receive text
        messages in the future.</p>
       <p>If you fail to follow the link in the email to verify your registration or fail to enter a
        cell phone code onto the Web site when prompted, your cell phone or email will not be
        registered with the system.</p>
       <h4>To edit your e2Campus account:</h4>
       <ol>
        <li>Visit: <a href="http://www.e2campus.com/my/evergreen/"
          >www.e2campus.com/my/evergreen/</a>.</li>
        <li>Login using the Username and Password you registered with.</li>
        <li>Click on the Services tab to edit your information.</li>

        <strong><em>The Woman and the War Baby</em> Weaves Calamity with Renewal to Indicate
         Poignancy in the Pedestrian and Interpose Serenity amidst Chaotic Circumstance</strong>
       </p>

        Ransom has completed a new book of poetry and prose called <em>The Woman and the War
         Baby</em>. The collection draws upon Ransom&amp;#8217;s experiences as a firefighter and
        advanced life support emergency medical technician during the 1980s and 1990s in the Olympic
        Peninsula&amp;#8217;s Jefferson County, his participation and familial adaptation to the
        damage caused by warfare, his volunteer work with humanitarian groups in Central America,
        and his personal mental travels and experience of atmospheres replete with action and
        implication.</p>
       <p>Published by Blue Begonia Press, the book features cover art and images by Evergreen
        faculty member Joe Feddersen and Ransom&amp;#8217;s translations of poetry by faculty
        member, <a href="site://evergreen.edu/news/archives/2007/12/zhanger">Zhang Er</a>. Ransom
        received a grant for the book from the Seattle-based nonprofit arts organization, Artist
        Trust. The Woman and The War Baby includes poems from his published book, Last Call, and his
        CD, War Baby. The book is Ransom&amp;#8217;s seventh poetry collection.</p>
       <p>Ransom, Evergreen&amp;#8217;s academic dean of curriculum, has also published numerous
        other books, including a book of poetry, Finding True North from Copper Canyon Press, which
        was nominated for the Pulitzer Prize and the National Book Award. In 1973, Ransom founded
        the Port Townsend Writers&amp;#8217; Conference at Centrum, the arts colony located at Fort
        Worden State Park. Held each summer, this gathering is renowned for its intensive, weeklong
        writing workshops, which are taught by notable authors, as well as its readings, panel
        discussions and social events.</p>
       <p class="details">The Evergreen State College is a nationally recognized public liberal arts
        and sciences college known for its distinctive interdisciplinary curriculum, high level of
        student/faculty engagement and emphasis on putting learning into action.</p>

       <p>(Olympia, Wash.) The Evergreen State College&amp;#8217;s Student and Academic Support
        Services department will receive a $5,760,000 six-year GEAR UP grant from the Department of
        Education.</p>
       <p>GEAR UP &amp;#8211; an acronym for Gaining Early Awareness and Readiness for Undergraduate
        Programs &amp;#8211; has been an Evergreen tradition since 2002. GEAR UP grants are designed
        to increase the rates of college attendance by working with students beginning in middle
        school. The national program is focused on reducing poverty by supporting
        students&amp;#8217; efforts to prepare for college and encouraging retention in schools.</p>
       <p>The second of two GEAR UP grants received by Evergreen will be used to serve Clover Park
        and Oakville school districts. Approximately 2,800 students have participated in GEAR UP to
        date. The new six-year grant will provide for direct services to another cohort of students
        -- approximately an additional 2,800 students --- including mentoring programs, information
        for families and professional development for teachers. The work relies heavily on
        partnerships with school districts and twenty six community groups.</p>
       <p>&amp;#8220;The whole purpose of GEAR UP, starting with the sixth and seventh grade is to
        help students graduate and enroll in college,&amp;#8221; says Dr. Kimberly Lees, GEAR UP
        director. &amp;#8220;And, this is not just about the students, the parents are a critical
        piece of the support system in the lives of students,&amp;#8221; adds Lees.</p>
       <p>&amp;#8220;GEAR UP helps the parents navigate the complicated process of choosing a
        college and gaining financial aid, as well as making vocational choices,&amp;#8221; says
        Lees. &amp;#8220;We give the parents the nuts and bolts information and start them off early
        in planning, including college visits, tutoring, and considering career options. Our grant
        is meant to help us go out and enlist the resources of community partners.&amp;#8221;</p>
       <p>Dr. Phyllis Lane, dean of academic and support services notes that the program
        &amp;#8220;provides help to restore communities, enhance cultural resources and share what
        we know.&amp;#8221; She notes that previous GEAR UP funds have resulted in a development of
        a culturally aware and relevant curriculum that did not exist for the Confederated Tribes of
        Chehalis.</p>
       <p>&amp;#8220;GEAR UP allows us the opportunity to change the course of history,&amp;#8221;
        says Lane. &amp;#8220;We have the opportunity to help students to learn, help their families
        to learn, and to help the students help themselves.&amp;#8221;</p>
       <p>Carletta Garraway, educational specialist at Lake High School in Clover Park, says GEAR UP
        &amp;#8220;creates vision and possibilities. The one thing I have learned in working with
        the kids is that they can learn that possibilities are unlimited.&amp;#8221;</p>
       <p>Garraway emphasizes that GEAR-UP&amp;#8217;s goal is to create both college readiness and

       <p>Olympia, WA &amp;#8211; The Evergreen State College recently received the designation
        &amp;#8220;College of Distinction&amp;#8221; in the newly-released 2008-2009 edition of
        Colleges of Distinction. Unlike traditional numeric-based college guidebooks, this book
        recognizes and appeals to students&amp;#8217; unique interests, realizing what may be
        &amp;#8220;the best&amp;#8221; college for one student, may be vastly different than the
        best for another.</p>
       <p>Approximately 40 colleges in each of the six geographical regions in the United States
        were selected as meeting four key criteria that make a college truly exceptional: engaged
        students, great teaching, vibrant communities, and successful outcomes. These are the
        &amp;#8220;hidden gems&amp;#8221; of higher education institutions - as determined by a
        review board of academicians, guidance counselors, and parents.</p>
       <p>&amp;quot;Obtaining a bachelor&amp;#8217;s degree shouldn&amp;#8217;t be a means to an
        end,&amp;#8221; says The Evergreen State College director of admissions, Doug Scrima.
        &amp;#8220;The colleges included in this guide book are truly invested in transformative
        learning. Prospective college students and their family members will appreciate this guide
        because it cuts through the ordinary to help you find the extraordinary.&amp;quot;</p>
       <p>Colleges of Distinction were required to go through an application process to be
        considered, be nationally recognized by education professionals, employ outstanding teachers
        that provide innovative learning experiences, have an active campus and community that
        allows for personal development, and be highly valued by employers for outstanding
        preparation.</p>

       <p>(Olympia, Wash.) Students at The Evergreen State College reported higher than average
        engagement on all benchmark measures of the 2008 National Survey of Student Engagement
        (NSSE), which included academic challenge, active and collaborative learning,
        student-faculty interaction, enriching educational experiences, and a supportive campus
        environment.</p>
       <p>Evergreen students scored the college strongly on the NSSE category Academic Challenge.
        They indicated that they spend more time preparing for class, engaging in coursework that
        requires synthesizing, analyzing, applying theory to practical problems, and making
        judgments about the value of information. They also reported reading more assigned
        texts.</p>
       <p>Compared with other first-year and senior-class students who reported to NSSE, Evergreen
        respondents indicated that they more frequently gave class presentations and contributed to
        discussions in class. They also indicated that they more often worked with other students on
        projects during class and outside of class, as well as discussed ideas from reading and
        classes with others outside of class- all measures of Active and Collaborative Learning. In
        terms of Student-Faculty Interaction, Evergreen students more often discussed ideas from
        class with faculty members outside of class. Evergreen first-years and seniors were less
        likely to come to class underprepared and more likely to report that they worked harder than
        they thought they could to meet their instructors&amp;#8217; expectations. They also
        reported greater institutional support for their academic success than their counterparts at
        other institutions.</p>
       <p>Evergreen first-year students and seniors were significantly more likely to have
        participated in several enriching educational experiences than students at other colleges
        and universities, engaging in more independent study and more frequent conversations with
        students who are different from themselves in terms of race, ethnicity, religion, political
        opinions, or values. Seven-hundred and twenty-two four-year colleges and universities
        participated in the survey. Evergreen conducts the National Survey of Student Engagement
        annually as part of its ongoing institutional assessment plan. The National Survey of
        Student Engagement works on the premise of providing a more complex reading on quality, with
        recognition that holistic assessments of many disaggregated factors provide for more
        accurate and useful comparisons on issues of concern for student learning than rankings
        systems that set institution wide averages of institutional resource measures.</p>
       <p>While Evergreen also does well in traditional regional and national rankings,
        Evergreen&amp;#8217;s regular participation in the National Survey of Student Engagement
        provides an additional national context and multi-year trend data through which to examine
        educational practices, emphases, and challenges. The survey had high participation at
        Evergreen with a response rate of near 30 percent of the 1550 students sampled.</p>

       <h2>Get weather updates via email or cell phone by signing up for e2Campus</h2>
       <p>The Evergreen State College has recently adopted the e2Campus emergency notification
        system that enables the school to send urgent news via text-messaging to your cell phone
        and/or email.</p>
       <p>The service is available to all current students, faculty and staff of The Evergreen State
        College.</p>
       <p>Once you sign up for the service, the school can text your cell phone and/or email with
        timely information about emergencies and school closures (no general or non-urgent
        messages).&amp;#160; This replaces the prior FlashAlert system, so if you want these
        notifications, you will need to sign up for e2Campus.</p>
       <p>Depending on your personal cell phone plan, there may be a nominal fee from your carrier
        to receive text messages, but there is no charge from the school to use the service.</p>
       <p>To sign up, go to <a href="http://www.evergreen.edu/facilities/emergency/"
         title="http://www.evergreen.edu/facilities/emergency/"
         >www.evergreen.edu/emergencypreparedness</a> (and see additional directions below to help
        guide you through the simple registration process).</p>
       <p>While the introduction of e2Campus is designed to improve on past emergency communication
        systems, no single system can guarantee the ability to reach all subscribers in all
        circumstances.&amp;#160; We are working on further improvements for on-campus communication
        in case of emergency.&amp;#160; Here are some other resources for information on weather
        delays and closures.</p>

       <p>Due to poor weather conditions, The Evergreen State College Olympia campus will not open

       <p>Please check <a href="http://www.evergreen.edu">www.evergreen.edu</a> for an update on
        potential campus delays or closures.</p>

       <h2>Get weather updates via email or cell phone by signing up for e2Campus</h2>
       <p>The Evergreen State College has recently adopted the e2Campus emergency notification
        system that enables the school to send urgent news via text-messaging to your cell phone
        and/or email.</p>
       <p>The service is available to all current students, faculty and staff of The Evergreen State
        College.</p>
       <p>Once you sign up for the service, the school can text your cell phone and/or email with
        timely information about emergencies and school closures (no general or non-urgent
        messages).&amp;#160; This replaces the prior FlashAlert system, so if you want these
        notifications, you will need to sign up for e2Campus.</p>
       <p>Depending on your personal cell phone plan, there may be a nominal fee from your carrier
        to receive text messages, but there is no charge from the school to use the service.</p>
       <p>To sign up, go to <a href="http://www.evergreen.edu/facilities/emergency/"
         title="http://www.evergreen.edu/facilities/emergency/"
         >www.evergreen.edu/emergencypreparedness</a> (and see additional directions below to help
        guide you through the simple registration process).</p>
       <p>While the introduction of e2Campus is designed to improve on past emergency communication
        systems, no single system can guarantee the ability to reach all subscribers in all
        circumstances.&amp;#160; We are working on further improvements for on-campus communication
        in case of emergency.</p>

       <p>Due to poor weather conditions, The Evergreen State College Olympia campus will not open
        until 10 a.m. Tuesday, December 23rd.</p>
       <p>Please check <a href="http://www.evergreen.edu">www.evergreen.edu</a> for an update on
        potential campus delays or closures.</p>
       <p>Alternately, you can call (360) 867-6000 and press 1 for operating status of the Olympia

       <h2>Get weather updates via email or cell phone by signing up for e2Campus</h2>
       <p>The Evergreen State College has recently adopted the e2Campus emergency notification
        system that enables the school to send urgent news via text-messaging to your cell phone
        and/or email.</p>
       <p>The service is available to all current students, faculty and staff of The Evergreen State
        College.</p>
       <p>Once you sign up for the service, the school can text your cell phone and/or email with
        timely information about emergencies and school closures (no general or non-urgent
        messages).&amp;#160; This replaces the prior FlashAlert system, so if you want these
        notifications, you will need to sign up for e2Campus.</p>
       <p>Depending on your personal cell phone plan, there may be a nominal fee from your carrier
        to receive text messages, but there is no charge from the school to use the service.</p>
       <p>To sign up, go to <a href="http://www.evergreen.edu/facilities/emergency/"
         title="http://www.evergreen.edu/facilities/emergency/"
         >www.evergreen.edu/emergencypreparedness</a> (and see additional directions below to help
        guide you through the simple registration process).</p>
       <p>While the introduction of e2Campus is designed to improve on past emergency communication
        systems, no single system can guarantee the ability to reach all subscribers in all
        circumstances.&amp;#160; We are working on further improvements for on-campus communication
        in case of emergency.</p>

        <p>
         <strong>John Ford: First of all, let&amp;#8217;s be clear. HD doesn&amp;#8217;t stand for
          anything. That&amp;#8217;s just a marketing thing. HD is the name of a digital format for
          radio broadcasting. Adding HD transmission capability will let KAOS broadcast additional
          &amp;#8216;channels&amp;#8217; alongside our regular signal.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
         <em>Host: Do analog listeners need to worry about upgrading their equipment to keep their
          beloved KAOS coming in strong?</em>
        </p>
        <p>
         <strong>JF: Any FM radio will still get 89.3 FM, but HD radios will get that plus the new
          digital channels, let&amp;#8217;s call them &amp;#8220;KAOS 2,&amp;#8221; &amp;#8220;KAOS
          3,&amp;#8221; and so on. You&amp;#8217;ll have to have HD equipment to get the new
          channels, but plain old FM will always be there&amp;#8212;a far more equitable
          arrangement, especially for folks with limited resources. Unlike the digital TV push which
          eliminates analog TV and forces everyone to get new sets or subscribe to cable, this does
          not force folks to &amp;#8220;switch.&amp;#8221;</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
         <em>Host: So, I assume that with more airwaves, KAOS will be growing. Can we also assume
          that the station will keep its community-centered philosophy and its core reliance on
          volunteers for programming?</em>
        </p>
        <p>
         <strong>JF: Definitely. Those additional channels will be dedicated to additional
          programming. Personally I&amp;#8217;m very excited about the prospect of more [broadcast]
          space for more service to the community&amp;#8212;and more volunteers</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
         <em>Host: I understand the $78,872 will pay to purchase and install new transmission
          equipment over the next couple of years during the CAB remodel. Does this funding come
          with strings attached?</em>
        </p>
        <p>
         <strong>JF: Well, the total costs for the project are budgeted closer to
          $100,000&amp;#8212;we&amp;#8217;re still hammering out the final figures&amp;#8212;so it
          will require additional funding from the station. And we may ask our listeners to help us
          meet that goal. We&amp;#8217;ll be letting folks know our needs as we get further into the
          project.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
         <em>Host: Thanks so much and good luck with going digital.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
         <strong>JF: Thank you. It&amp;#8217;s a big win for non-commercial, community radio in the
          South Sound area.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>Host: That was John Ford and I talking earlier today. In addition to Mr. Ford, who
         spearheaded the grant effort, we want to congratulate Andy Corn, Jerry Drummond, Tom
         Mercado, and Rob Rensel for their contributions to the project. If all goes according to
         plan, KAOS will broadcast its first official digital program within a year of returning to
         its new and improved station, which will be constructed during the CAB remodel in
         2009-10.</p>

       <h4>More on KAOS</h4>
       <p>Evergreen&amp;#8217;s KAOS radio station recently received top honors from the Princeton
        Review as one of the nation&amp;#8217;s best college or university radio stations.
        Development director John Ford said he believes it&amp;#8217;s the station&amp;#8217;s
        strong community-oriented service ethic, combined with a focus on local and independent
        music that makes KAOS distinctive among others surveyed. The station emphasizes local
        speakers and issues, allowing content to be shaped by the needs of its public. KAOS gets the
        opportunity to grow creatively in ways larger stations cannot, due to its unique
        non-commercial and educational status. According to Ford, KAOS programming showcases a wide
        variety of voices never heard on commercial radio.</p>

       <p>(Olympia, Wash.)&amp;#160; In a move that will improve access to advanced education for
        area teachers, the Washington State Higher Education Coordinating Board has approved the
        launch of a new Master of Education Program in Curriculum and Instruction at The Evergreen
        State College in Olympia.&amp;#160; The board made the decision at its January 25
        meeting.&amp;#160; The program is intended for practicing teachers and will offer tracks in
        Mathematics and English as a Second Language (ESL).&amp;#160; It will begin enrolling
        students immediately.&amp;#160; Classes are scheduled to start this summer.&amp;#160;</p>
       <p>&amp;quot;We&amp;#39;ve designed a flexible and affordable program to help teachers
        improve their skills, advance in their careers and take on new leadership roles in the
        education community,&amp;quot; said program director Magda Costantino, Ph.D.</p>
       <p>Costantino said the approximate tuition cost for the 40-46 credit, seven quarter program
        is under $10,000 for Washington residents. &amp;quot;That makes it an excellent value for
        working teachers,&amp;quot; Costantino noted.</p>
       <p>Costantino said that in addition to a core curriculum, teachers will also deepen their
        knowledge in mathematics or ESL education in preparation for state endorsement testing.</p>
       <p>&amp;quot;The Master in Education at Evergreen will provide excellent professional
        development opportunities for teachers in the South Sound region,&amp;quot; says Randy
        Spaulding, Higher Education Coordinating Board director of academic affairs.
        &amp;quot;Evergreen&amp;#39;s proposal was very timely in that it responds to several
        strategies included in Gov. Chris Gregoire&amp;#39;s Washington Learns report, such as the
        need to build expertise in math and science teaching; improve learning opportunities for
        English language learners; and encourage diversity and cultural understanding.&amp;quot;</p>
       <p>&amp;quot;The program builds on the strength of the current Master in Teaching program and
        Evergreen&amp;#39;s teacher professional development activities, and will allow teachers to
        improve their teaching practice and add additional endorsements in either math or ESL
        &amp;#8211; both of which are in high demand right now,&amp;quot; adds Spaulding.</p>
       <p>The program will begin with a full-time summer session in July and August and continue
        with part-time evening and weekend classes through the school year.</p>
       <p>

        stately as well as exuberant, structured as well as improvisational, deeply moving on a
        spiritual level as well as simply enjoyable for their sheer beauty. <a

       <p>(Olympia, Wash) More wild salmon could soon be making their home on campus and in Puget
        Sound with a bit of ingenuity applied to a culvert and bulkhead on the Evergreen State
        College campus.</p>
       <p>With funding and assistance from partners including the The Evergreen State College,
        Washington State Salmon Recovery Funding Board, The Wild Fish Conservancy People For Puget
        Sound, the Estuary and Salmon Restoration Program and The National Oceanic and Atmospheric
        Administration--Restore America&amp;#8217;s Estuaries program, an undersized culvert at the
        mouth of campus&amp;#8217;s Snyder Creek will be removed and replaced by a 14-foot wide box
        culvert. The cost of the culvert project totals $214,000, and is covered by contributions
        from The Evergreen State College, the Salmon Recovery Funding Board, and the Estuary and
        Salmon Restoration Program.</p>
       <p>The new culvert will restore passage for fish species such as coho salmon, chum salmon,
        and cutthroat. These fish will once again gain access to almost one mile of spawning and
        rearing habitat. The process will also restore the natural processes of sediment, wood, and
        water transport.</p>
       <p>Bulkheads, barrier culverts, and other shoreline obstructions represent threats to salmon
        habitat throughout the Puget Sound, and this project represents a potential model for
        actions around the Sound to restore fish access to critical breeding and rearing habitat.
        Restoring these habitats also has wider ecosystem benefits beyond the benefits for salmonids
        because it restores the ecological processes that shape diverse habitat structures. The
        shoreline of the College is one of the largest remaining stretches of undeveloped shoreline
        in south Puget Sound and thus restoration adjacent to that shoreline provides an opportunity
        for significant impact.</p>
       <p>Snyder Creek flows into Snyder Cove at the northern end of The Evergreen State College
        Campus. Work will take place in Snyder Cove during Spring and Summer 2008. Pending the
        results of the feasibility study work on bulkhead removal should begin in Summer 2009.</p>
       <p>Dan Grosboll, an Evergreen State College alumnus and now South Puget Sound Habitat
        Restoration Coordinator for People For Puget Sound, says, &amp;#8220;We see this as a great
        opportunity for the Sound, and a good example of a public-private partnership that can bring
        benefits for the school as well as the environment. This is a great educational opportunity
        as well because students are welcome to get involved in the restoration and monitoring and
        we will be working with faculty members on various aspects of the project,&amp;#8221; says
        Grosboll.</p>
       <p>The total funding for the bulkhead removal feasibility study part of the project is about
        $60,000 with funding from National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Restore
        America&amp;#8217;s Estuaries program, Estuary and Salmon Restoration Program, and People
        For Puget Sound.</p>

       <p>Rachel Corrie&amp;#39;s story has shocked and horrified people across the globe. Now, it
        will be immortalized in a documentary film expected to air in March on Britain&amp;#39;s
        Channel 4.</p>
       <p>Corrie, an Olympia peace activist and senior at The Evergreen State College, was killed
        March 16 in the Gaza Strip by an Israeli military bulldozer.</p>
       <p>Sandra Jordan, a reporter for Channel 4 and The Observer newspaper, is developing the film
        along with producer Rodrigo Vasquez. The pair recently received acclaim for a documentary
        first aired on Channel 4 in June titled &amp;quot;The Killing Zone,&amp;quot; which tracks
        ongoing violence in the Gaza Strip. Both filmmakers have been in Olympia this week to
        capture the city Corrie called home.</p>
       <p>&amp;quot;There has been a lot of interest in Britain and around the world about what
        happened to Rachel,&amp;quot; Jordan said Wednesday between filming sessions in Olympia.
        &amp;quot;I find it highly disappointing that no serious American investigative journalist
        has taken Rachel&amp;#39;s story seriously or questioned or challenged the Israeli Army
        version of events.&amp;quot;</p>
       <p>
        <strong>On the scene</strong>
       </p>
       <p>Jordan and Vasquez also followed Corrie&amp;#39;s parents during their visit to Rafah in
        September -- the couple&amp;#39;s first trip to the place where their daughter had been
        making a stand for peace. Corrie&amp;#39;s father, Craig, said it was amazing to witness the
        hope and kindness among the people he and wife Cindy met in Rafah despite the continuous
        violence. He said the film will probably help the couple absorb what they witnessed in Gaza.
        &amp;quot;You feel all that pain; it&amp;#39;s just everywhere,&amp;quot; Craig Corrie said.
        &amp;quot;I think it&amp;#39;s a story worth getting out to the rest of the world, and it
        helps us understand. ... I&amp;#39;m hopeful that when this is done, it&amp;#39;s laid out
        in a fashion that truly reflects where Rachel was.&amp;quot;</p>
       <p>The filmmakers also contacted officials at Evergreen, who could become part of the
        documentary. The college was hit hard by Corrie&amp;#39;s death, school officials said this
        week.</p>
       <p>&amp;quot;It was a very sad place,&amp;quot; said Jim Beaver, the school&amp;#39;s
        director of college relations. &amp;quot;We were a part of her life.&amp;quot;</p>

       <p>Dr. Helena Meyer-Knapp, a faculty member at The Evergreen State College, will read from
        her new book &amp;#8220;Dangerous Peace-Making&amp;#8221; at the Friends of the Library

       <p>Through seven case studies, Meyer-Knapp describes how combatants in the midst of war begin
        to believe that the time has come to cease hostilities. She began the book, which is
        particularly timely given the number of tension points around the world, during a yearlong
        research fellowship at Harvard.</p>

       <p>To have a single player recognized as Cascade Conference or NAIA Region I Player of the
        Week is a noteworthy accomplishment. To have three players&amp;#8212; Meredith Lane, Joe
        Gjertsen and Carly Stewart&amp;#8212;from three different sports&amp;#8212; volleyball and
        men&amp;#39;s and women&amp;#39;s soccer, respectively&amp;#8212;each earn conference and
        region honors is a remarkable feat.</p>
       <p>But two NAIA National Players of the Week? It may be unprecedented.</p>
       <p>Evergreen&amp;#8217;s Lane named earned the honor in volleyball and Gjertsen in
        men&amp;#8217;s soccer.</p>
       <p>The volleyball team hosted six-ranked Oregon Institute of Technology on Oct. 3, when they
        equaled last year&amp;#8217;s school record of seven wins in a season. Hometown player and
        middle blocker Meredith Lane, a junior from Olympia High School, had 17 kills on 29 attempts
        as the Geoducks defeated the Hustlin&amp;#39; Owls 3-1. The following night, Lane followed
        with a school record 29 kills on 58 attempts as Evergreen handed Southern Oregon their first
        conference loss in five games, 3-2. The defeat knocked Southern Oregon down four notches
        from the No.15 spot in the NAIA national poll.</p>
       <p>Tacoma native Joe Gjertsen, also a junior, put Evergreen back into soccer playoff
        contention on Oct. 3 with a two-goal performance against Concordia, the top-ranked
        men&amp;#8217;s team in NAIA region I. The 3-1 victory pushed the Geoducks into a tie for
        fourth place with Western Baptist. The top four teams in the conference advance to the
        postseason tournament.</p>
       <p>The next day, Gjertsen added to his conference-leading season total by scoring four goals
        and an assist in an 8-0 victory over Cascade College. It was Gjertsen&amp;#39;s fourth hat
        trick of the season.</p>
       <p>Gjertsen scored Evergreen&amp;#39;s first and fifth goals in a 9-2 win over visiting Walla
        Walla College on Oct. 5. His two assists in the game moved him up to third place on the
        Cascade Conference&amp;#8217;s assist list.</p>
       <p>On Oct. 1, freshman goalkeeper Carly Stewart, from Federal Way, recorded 16 saves and
        shutout visiting Concordia University. The Cavaliers are four-time defending Cascade
        Conference women&amp;#39;s soccer champions, and were ranked third in the nation. The game,
        which took 110:00 minutes, ended in a 0-0 double overtime tie and was Stewart&amp;#39;s
        second shutout of the season.</p>

       <p>We&amp;#8217;re Dubbed &amp;#8220;Most For Your Money&amp;#8221;</p>
       <p>In a summer laden with accolades from the likes of U.S. News &amp;#38; World Report,
        Outside, and Elle Girl, Evergreen has garnered yet another. It rates among a dozen
        &amp;#8220;Hot Schools for 2004,&amp;#8221; according to Newsweek. The college is the
        magazine&amp;#8217;s pick for &amp;#8220;most for your money.&amp;#8221;</p>
       <p>&amp;#8220;With states increasingly focusing resources on small liberal-arts colleges in
        their systems, Evergreen has become a contender for those who might head off to pricey
        private schools. It has a private school&amp;#8217;s size (4,080), curriculum and
        educational chops,&amp;#8221;says authors Mary Carmichael and Karen Springen.</p>
       <p>Evergreen President Thomas L. &amp;#8220;Les&amp;#8221; Purce credits the hard work and
        dedication of the college&amp;#8217;s faculty and staff for the high profile it enjoys.
        &amp;#8220;The people who work here are richly talented. Our focus on being a
        student-centered enterprise extends throughout our organization. The Evergreen emphasis on
        teaching and learning really makes the difference.&amp;#8221;<br/>

        Noon&amp;#8211;1:15 p.m.<br/> Tickets available by reservation and at the door</p>
       <p>To kickoff their basketball seasons&amp;#8212;and to support local charities&amp;#8212;the
        basketball programs at The Evergreen State College and Saint Martin&amp;#8217;s College are
        hosting a lunch at Evergreen&amp;#8217;s Longhouse on Friday, Oct. 31 from noon to 1:15 p.m.
        The men&amp;#8217;s and women&amp;#8217;s teams from both colleges will be in attendance as
        the community is invited to meet the players and hear season previews from the coaches.
        Proceeds from the event will benefit the Olympia YWCA&amp;#8217;s Other Bank, a resource
        that provides hygiene and other personal care items to people in need. Tickets are $15 and
        available by calling (360) 867-6551 and at the door. Requests for tickets by Oct. 22 will be
        appreciated.</p>
       <p>Guests who arrive between 11:30 a.m. and 12:30 p.m. should notify the parking booth
        attendant that they are attending this event to receive complimentary parking.<br/> The
        event was inaugurated last year at Saint Martin&amp;#8217;s, with the arrangement that the
        school not hosting the basketball game will offer the lunch. Dick Nichols, longtime sports
        enthusiast and local high school sports commentator, once again will serve as the master of
        ceremonies.</p>
       <p>&amp;#8220;We&amp;#8217;re excited not just to get the basketball season under
        way,&amp;#8221; says Evergreen President Thomas L. &amp;#8220;Les&amp;#8221; Purce.
        &amp;#8220;We&amp;#8217;re honored to be in the position to offer something back to the
        community which has supported us and our athletic programs over the years. We&amp;#8217;re
        grateful, too, to be partnering with our neighbors in Lacey. &amp;#8221;</p>
       <p>The traditional crosstown rivalry between the Geoducks and the Saints takes place at Saint
        Martin&amp;#8217;s Pavilion on Wed., Nov. 12, with the women tipping off at 5 p.m. and the
        men at 7:30 p.m. This is the second year for this exhibition game.</p>

        parking $1.25</p>
       <p>Kate Bornstein, celebrated writer, performance artist and gender theorist, is the 2003 Cal
        Anderson Memorial Lecture Series speaker. She brings her insightful, compassionate and
        provocative views to The Evergreen State College on Friday, Nov. 14 in the Communications
        Building Recital Hall at 8 p.m. A book signing follows the talk, which is free and open to
        the public. A selection of books will be available for purchase.</p>
       <p>Kate, who makes her home in New York, was born male and raised as a son. In adulthood,
        Kate underwent a sex-change operation and a few years later, decided she wasn&amp;#8217;t
        female, either. Kate&amp;#8217;s 1994 book &amp;#8220;Gender Outlaw: On Men, Women and the
        Rest of Us&amp;#8221; describes Kate&amp;#8217;s observations about personal gender and the
        meaning of transgender. Kate will discuss this work during the appearance. Kate is
        responsible for a number of titles, including &amp;#8220;Too Tall Blondes in:
        LOVE,&amp;#8221; written and performed with Barbara Carrellas; the book &amp;#8220;My Gender
        Workbook&amp;#8221;; and the performance piece &amp;#8220;Strangers in Paradise,&amp;#8221;
        which opened this year at San Francisco&amp;#8217;s Theatre Rhinoceros. Colleges across the
        country use Kate&amp;#8217;s books, and Kate&amp;#8217;s performances have been staged in
        the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Germany and Austria. Presently Kate is
        working on the autobiography &amp;#8220;Hard Candy: The Tragic Lives and Comical Deaths of
        Candy Bromowitz.&amp;#8221; A new children&amp;#8217;s book, &amp;#8220;Hello Cruel
        World,&amp;#8221; is in the works and suggests alternatives to teen suicide. Cal Anderson
        was Washington state&amp;#39;s first openly gay lawmaker. He represented the 43rd
        legislative district in Seattle, encompassing the University District and Capital Hill.
        Anderson was appointed to the House of Representatives in 1987 and elected to terms in 1988,
        1990 and 1992. He was then elected to the state Senate in 1994 and served until his death in
        August 1995. A Vietnam-era veteran, Anderson was the recipient of two Bronze Stars and four
        U.S. Army commendation medals.<br/>
       </p>
       <p>The Cal Anderson Memorial Lecture Series is a legacy to the issues Anderson championed
        during his public service career. This forum captures the spirit of reasoned discussion of
        public policies and ideas that were the hallmarks of his career. Anderson supported a number
        of causes, including environmental protection, veterans benefits and campaign finance
        reform. But perhaps he is best known for his leadership in fighting for equal civil rights
        protection for gays and lesbians and for securing funding for AIDS programs.<br/> Past
        series speakers include U.S. Rep. Barney Frank from Massachusetts and author Rebecca
        Brown.<br/> For information, call Jeannie Chandler, in provost&amp;#39;s office, at (360)

       <p>Tues., Nov. 11, 2003<br/> 11:30 a.m.&amp;#8211;1 p.m.<br/> Communications Building,
        Recital Hall<br/> Free and open to the public<br/> Campus parking $1.25</p>
       <p>In honor of all who have served in the military, The Evergreen State College invites the
        public to its free Veterans Day celebration on Tues., Nov. 11 from 11:30 a.m. to 1 p.m. in
        the Communications Building Recital Hall. Retired Lt. Col. Leroy Roberts, one of the famed
        Tuskegee Airmen, is the guest speaker and will talk about the history of these first African
        American pilots in the U.S. Army Air Corps. A special free screening of the two-hour film
        &amp;#8220;When We Were Kids &amp;#8230; We Went to War,&amp;#8221; in which Roberts
        appears, follows the program.</p>
       <p>Roberts is a distinguished World War II fighter pilot who flew 42 missions with the 332nd
        Fighter Group stationed in Italy. Serving in Korea as a flight commander, he led 106
        missions as part of the United Nations force. Roberts has been awarded the Distinguished
        Flying Cross with one cluster, the Air Medal with 11 clusters and the Air Force Commendation
        Medal with one cluster.</p>
       <p>The Tuskegee Airmen enlisted to become the nation&amp;#8217;s first black military airmen.
        Coming from every part of country during World War II, those who met the rigorous physical
        and mental standards were trained as aviators of single-engines planes and, later, as
        twin-engine pilots, navigators or bombardiers. Most were college students or graduates.
        Those with no college background demonstrated their academic qualifications through
        competitive entrance exams. Enlisted members were trained as aircraft and engine mechanics,
        armament specialists, radio repairmen, parachute riggers and other positions crucial to the
        flying squadrons.</p>
       <p>Navigators, bombardiers and gunnery crews received their training at selected military
        bases. The airmen who qualified as pilots were trained at Tuskegee Army Air Field in
        Alabama. From 1942 through 1946, 992 pilots graduated from Tuskegee, receiving their wings
        and commissions. Of that group, 450 served overseas in either the 99th Pursuit Squadron or
        the 332nd Fighter Group. Both distinguished themselves in combat. The 99th became the only
        four-squadron fighter group to escort bombers in the 15th Air Force and posted the
        unprecedented record of flying all of its 200 bomber escort missions without the loss of a
        single bomber to enemy aircraft. It received two presidential citations for outstanding
        tactical air support and aerial combat in the 12th Air Force before joining the 332nd
        Fighter Group, which then was awarded a presidential unit citation for a remarkable bomber
        escort mission to Berlin.</p>

       <p>Evergreen Faculty Member Receives Fulbright Scholar Award - Dr. Martha Henderson to Do
        Research in Greece</p>
       <p>Dr. Martha Henderson, who teaches geography at The Evergreen State College, has been
        awarded a Fulbright Scholar grant to perform research at the University of the Aegean, on
        Lesvos Island, Mytilini, Greece. She will research the cultural differences and perspectives
        on wildland fire management.<br/>
        <br/> My work will help define regional and cultural attitudes toward the occurrence and
        management policies of wildland fires around the Aegean Basin,&amp;#8221; Henderson says.
        She will join a team of geographers who study natural hazards and global environmental
        changes. &amp;#8220;My contribution will be to unravel the cultural landscape of wildland
        fires.&amp;#8221; She will travel to conferences in Turkey and Spain, and plans to deliver
        her research findings at a conference in Greece.<br/>
        <br/> Henderson says that her international research will be shared with Evergreen faculty
        in the areas of Middle East and Eastern Europe, and in the master of environmental science
        program at Evergreen.<br/>
        <br/> Recipients of Fulbright Scholar awards are selected on the basis of academic or
        professional achievement and because they have demonstrated extraordinary leadership
        potential in their fields.<br/>
        <br/> Henderson is one of approximately 800 U.S. faculty and professionals who will travel
        abroad to some 140 countries for the current academic year through the Fulbright Scholar
        Program. Established in 1946 under legislation introduced by the late Sen. J. William
        Fulbright of Arkansas, the program&amp;#8217;s purpose is to build mutual understanding
        between the people of the United States and other countries.<br/>
        <br/> The U.S. Department of State, Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs sponsors the
        Fulbright Program, America&amp;#8217;s premier international educational exchange activity.
        Over the course of 57 years, thousands of U.S. faculty and professionals have studied,
        taught or done research abroad, and comparable numbers of their counterparts from other
        countries have engaged in similar activities in the United States.</p>

       <p>(Olympia, Wash.) The Evergreen State College in Olympia is rolling out the welcome mat for
        prospective undergraduate students and their parents with its annual Preview Day on

        of the nation&amp;#8217;s top colleges by the <span>Princeton Review, Colleges of
         Distinction</span>, and <span>US News &amp; World Report</span>. The book
        &amp;#8220;Colleges That Change Lives&amp;#8221; (www.ctcl.com) by former <span>New York
         Times</span> education editor Loren Pope, praises Evergreen as one of the three best

       <h4>Distinguished historian Susan Stryker surveys the history of transgender discrimination

        a filmmaker. She was executive director of the GLBT Historical Society in San Francisco from
        1999 until 2003. In addition to numerous scholarship articles and magazine pieces, she is
        coauthor of Gay by the Bay: A History of Queer Culture in the San Francisco Bay Area (1996);
        contributing editor of the transgender studies special issue of GLQ: A Journal of Lesbian
        and Gay Studies (1998); author of Queer Pulp: Perverse Passions in the Golden Age of the
        Paperback (2001); co-director of the Emmy Award-winning public television documentary
        Screaming Queens: The Riot of Compton&amp;#8217;s Cafeteria (2005); co-editor of the Lambda

       <p><strong>Cal Anderson</strong> was Washington state&amp;#39;s first openly gay legislator,
        serving in the House of Representatives from 1987 to 1993 and in the Senate from 1994 to his
        death in 1995. The Cal Anderson Memorial Lecture Series is a forum to capture the spirit of
        reasoned discussion of public policies and ideas that marked Cal Anderson&amp;#39;s career.
        During his time in the legislature, he led the on-going battle for equal civil rights
        protection for gay and lesbian citizens and introduced many bills related to AIDS
        programs.&amp;#160; His wide-ranging commitment to public service included work for campaign
        finance and regulatory reform, motor-voter registration, veterans&amp;#39; issues,
        environmental protection and open access to government.&amp;#160; The Cal Anderson Memorial
        Lecture Series is funded by an endowment held by The Evergreen State College Foundation.</p>

       <p>OLYMPIA, Wash.--KAOS 89.3 FM Olympia Community Radio kicks off its first Membership Drive
        of 2009 on Thursday, February 26. The nine-day drive will end Friday, March 6. New
        supporters and renewing KAOS members are invited to contribute to the public radio
        station&amp;#8217;s drive goal of $30,000.</p>
       <p>&amp;#8220;Given the economy, this year will be more challenging for KAOS, as it will be
        for all non-profits,&amp;#8221; said John Ford, station Development Director.
        &amp;#8220;Thankfully, many listeners realize that KAOS provides commercial-free programming
        and community voices that they can&amp;#8217;t get anywhere else, and it&amp;#8217;s a
        service that requires them to pay their share. Our hope is to get more committed listeners
        to give at a level that fits their situation. Every donation at all levels still adds up to
        a stronger station for all KAOS listeners.&amp;#8221;</p>
       <p>All funds raised are used to support the programming and training activities of KAOS
        Olympia Community Radio. Celebrating 36 years of community service, KAOS has been the South
        Sound&amp;#8217;s only full-time, full-power commercial-free public radio service, offering
        a wide range of independent music, local and global news, and community information since
        1973. The station streams its broadcasting live on the World Wide Web, at www.kaosradio.org,
        and can be heard on Comcast cable in Thurston County on TCTV Public Access channel 22 as
        well as Comcast Digital Cable channel 982.</p>

       <h4>Official Biography</h4>
       <p>Robert W. McChesney is the Gutgsell Endowed Professor in the Department of Communication
        at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. In 2008 the Utne Reader listed McChesney
        among their &amp;quot;50 visionaries who are changing the world.&amp;quot;</p>
       <p>In 2002 he was the co-founder of Free Press, a national media reform organization and
        served as its President until April 2008, when he stepped down to devote more time to other
        interests.</p>
       <p>McChesney also hosts the &amp;quot;Media Matters&amp;quot; weekly radio program every
        Sunday afternoon on NPR-affiliate WILL-AM radio -
        http://will.uiuc.edu/am/mediamatters/default.htm; it is the top-rated program in its time
        slot in the Champaign-Urbana area.</p>
       <p>His work concentrates on the history and political economy of communication, emphasizing
        the role media play in democratic and capitalist societies. McChesney has written or edited
        seventeen books. McChesney&amp;#39;s most recent book is The Political Economy of Media:
        Enduring Issues, Emerging Dilemmas (Monthly Review Press); this is the companion volume to
        Communication Revolution: Critical Junctures and the Future of Media (New Press, 2007).</p>
       <p>In 2008, his 1999 book Rich Media, Poor Democracy was awarded the ICA Fellows Book Award,
        which recognizes books that &amp;quot;have made a substantial contribution to the
        scholarship of the communication field, as well as the broader rubric of the social
        sciences, and have stood some test of time.&amp;quot; McChesney&amp;#39;s work has been
        translated into eighteen languages.</p>
       <p>In 2001 Adbusters Magazine named him one of the &amp;quot;Nine Pioneers of Mental
        Environmentalism.&amp;quot; In 2006 right-winger David Horowitz included McChesney on his
        list of the &amp;quot;101 most dangerous professors in America.&amp;quot; While teaching at
        Wisconsin, he was selected as one of the top 100 classroom teachers on the Madison
        campus.</p>
       <p>In addition to his academic work, McChesney serves on the Board of Directors for several
        nonprofit and noncommercial media organizations. From 2000 to 2004 he served as co-editor of
        Monthly Review - www.monthlyreview.org - the independent socialist magazine founded by Paul
        Sweezy and Leo Huberman in 1949. Prior to entering graduate school in 1983, McChesney was a
        sports stringer for UPI, he published a weekly newspaper, and in 1979 was the founding
        publisher of The Rocket, a Seattle-based rock magazine. At the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame,
        in McChesney&amp;#39;s hometown of Cleveland, the founding of The Rocket is credited as the
        birth of the Seattle rock scene of the late 1980s and 1990s. In his spare time, McChesney
        writes on professional basketball for a number of websites.</p>

       <p>After 30 years, The Evergreen State College is retiring its annual Super Saturday
        community celebration. The free family-oriented event included entertainment, food, arts and
        craft vendors and community service groups. It was held each June on the same weekend as
        graduation.</p>
       <p>As the event grew and developed over time, it required an investment of hundreds of staff
        and volunteer hours each year, months of planning, and a net expense of about $20,000
        annually. While Super Saturday will remain an important part of our campus history and will
        be missed by many, the decision to retire the event will allow us to redirect resources to
        other college priorities, which is especially important as we work to address significant
        state budget cuts.</p>
       <p>In recent years the event drew an estimated 15,000-20,000 people to the campus, making it
        the single largest community event held on campus.</p>
       <p>While Super Saturday is coming to an end, Evergreen&amp;#39;s connections to its community
        continue. In addition to its primary role in providing higher education opportunities, some
        of Evergreen&amp;#39;s other contributions include free and low-cost community events and
        performances, public access to facilities, and student volunteers&amp;#39; support for local
        organizations.</p>

       <h3>About the Book</h3>
       <p>Where are the millions marching in the streets to defend human rights, civil liberties,
        and racial justice? Where is the mass revulsion against the killing and torture being
        carried out in our name? Where are the environmentalists? Where is the peace movement?</p>
       <p>The answer: They are everywhere.</p>
       <p><em>Standing Up to the Madness</em> is a timely, inspiring, and even revolutionary look at
        who wields the greatest power in America--everyday people who take a chance and stand up for
        what they believe in--and also offers advice on what you can do to help.</p>
       <p><em>Standing Up to the Madness</em> tells the stories of everyday citizens who have
        challenged the government and prevailed.</p>

       <h2>Basia Irland, Opening Remarks by President Les Purce</h2>
       <h3>Gallery opening, art exhibition</h3>
       <p>
        <strong>April 2, 5:30 pm to 7:30 pm (exhibition continues through April 29, 2009)</strong>
        <br/>
        <strong>The Evergreen State College Gallery, Main Floor of The Daniel J. Evans Library at
         Evergreen</strong>
       </p>
       <p>Basia Irland is a sculptor and installation artist, a poet and book artist, and an
        activist in international water issues. Her thoughtful interdisciplinary projects combine
        beautiful artworks, a fascination with research, and a participative engagement with the
        viewer.</p>
       <p>The exhibition at Evergreen Gallery, <em>A Gathering of Waters: The Nisqually River,
         Source to Sound</em> includes a survey of Irland&amp;#8217;s earlier artworks, which
        provides context for her recent project created while working as an artist-in-residence.
        Through this grass-roots participatory project, Irland has sought to connect people and
        bring more attention to ongoing efforts for protecting and honoring our rivers and streams.
        While exploring the effect of human controls and demands on rivers, it celebrates the people
        who work to conserve our watershed.</p>
       <p>This project is generously supported by a gift from the Tom Rye Harvill Award.</p>
       <p>Irland is Professor Emerita, University of New Mexico, Department of Art and Art History.
        She has created projects about water issues throughout North and South America, Europe,
        Africa, and Southeast Asia. Her work has been exhibited internationally and is in 22
        permanent collections including the Albright-Knox Art Gallery, Public Archives of Canada,
        and the Victoria and Albert Museum, London. She has received numerous grants and awards
        including a Fulbright Senior Research Award to Southeast Asia. In 1999, Irland produced a
        documentary that was shown on PBS: A Gathering of Waters: The Rio Grande, Source to Sea. A
        monograph on her art, titled <em>Water Library</em>, was published in 2007 by University of
        New Mexico Press.</p>

       <h2>Grandmothers Counsel the World at The Evergreen State College</h2>
       <h3>Members of International Council of Indigenous Grandmothers Arrives in Early May<br/>
        <br/>
       </h3>
       <p>(Olympia and Tacoma, Wash.) The International Council of Thirteen Indigenous Grandmothers
        was formed almost five years ago out of a deep concern for &amp;#8220;the unprecedented
        destruction of our Mother Earth and the destruction of indigenous ways of life.&amp;#8221;
        The Council, which includes spiritual leaders from across the world, assembles to pray,
        share ancestral wisdom and counsel the world from multiple perspectives of distinctive
        cultures.</p>
       <p>The Evergreen State College welcomes four North American members of this council of
        leaders of nations. The Grandmothers will share their views on the environment, resiliency,
        peace and knowledge in a time of unprecedented global change.</p>
       <h2>Schedule</h2>
       <p><strong><br/> On Saturday, May 2</strong>, the week of events opens with the
         <strong>keynote presentation</strong>, the <em><strong>Traditional Salish Welcome Ceremony
          and Presentation by the Four Grandmothers from 1:00 to 4:00 p.m.</strong></em>, with
        reception and food provided by The Lucky Eagle Casino. The free, public event will take
        place at The Evergreen State College, Daniel J. Evans Library, 2nd Floor Lobby, 2700
        Evergreen Parkway NW, Olympia, Washington 98505.</p>
       <p>During the <strong><em>Welcome Ceremony and keynote presentation,</em></strong> the elders
        will share their knowledge and experience of indigenous science, spiritual healing and
        ceremony, peace and prayer. The purpose of their conversation is to engage thought on the
        world&amp;#8217;s spiritual, earthly, and cultural resources through examples from the
        experience of the grandmothers and from a deep reservoir of cultural wisdom.</p>
       <p><strong>On Tuesday, May 5,</strong> the visiting council members will pair up for two
        distinct, free public talks entitled &amp;#8220;<strong><em>Ancestral Teachings for Times of
          Unprecedented Change</em>.&amp;#8221;</strong></p>
       <p><strong>Mona Polacca and Rita Pitka Blumenstein</strong> will deliver their message at
         <strong>Evergreen&amp;#8217;s Tacoma campus on <em>May 5 from 11:00 a.m. to 1:00
         p.m</em></strong>. (This talk will be telecast live at Evergreen&amp;#8217;s Olympia campus
        in Lecture Hall 1.) The Tacoma campus is located at 1210 6th Avenue, Tacoma, WA 98405</p>
       <p><strong>Rita Long Visitor Holy Dance and Council Chair Agnes Baker Pilgrim</strong> will
        speak on that same theme <strong><em>May 5 from 7:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m</em>.</strong> at
        Evergreen&amp;#8217;s <strong>Olympia</strong>
        <strong>campus</strong>, Lecture Hall 1.</p>
       <p>Anyone attending one of the previous events is invited to join in honoring and thanking
        the visiting council members at <strong>the Closing Ceremony and Reception on Friday, May
         8</strong>, from 5:00 p.m. to 7:00 p.m. in Seminar II, E1107.</p>

       <h3>About the Grandmothers</h3>
       <p>The concept of the council of elders is an ancient form of governance ruled by a circle
        rather than a hierarchy of command. Councils of elders are emerging in Europe, Australia and
        the Middle East. The four elders are here as North American representatives of an
        international council formed out of concern for the destruction of Mother Earth, indigenous
        ways of life, and the wellbeing of humanity. They will visit and teach at Evergreen, local
        schools, and in the wider South Sound communities. The first council gathering was a time of
        hope and inspiration. The grandmothers are women of prayer and women of action. Their
        traditional ways link them with the forces of the Earth. Their solidarity with one another
        creates a web to rebalance the injustices wrought from an imbalanced world; a world
        disconnected from the fundamental laws of nature and the original teachings based on a
        respect for all of life.</p>
       <ul>
        <li><strong>Rita Pitka Blumenstein</strong> serves as the first certified tribal doctor in
         the state of Alaska. She is a Yup&amp;#39;ik mother, grandmother, great grandmother, wife,
         aunt, sister, friend, and tribal elder. Well known as a traditional healer, teacher, and
         artist, she has spent over forty years investigating, producing, and passing on many
         aspects of Alaska Native culture such as song, drumming, skin sewing, basketry,
         storytelling, and use of plants for dyes and medicinal purposes. She has traveled and
         taught in 167 countries.</li>
       </ul>
       <ul>
        <li><strong>Rita Long Visitor Holy Dance</strong> is a Lakota keeper of the traditional
         ways, great grandmother, Native American Church elder, and bead worker. She lives with her

         With her sister, Grandmother Rita initiated the Council&amp;#8217;s Youth Ambassador
         program. She is involved in the Grandmothers&amp;#8217; efforts to encourage the Vatican to
         rescind several Papal Bulls and edicts that set the stage for the &amp;quot;doctrine of
         conquest&amp;quot; that has had such far-reaching effects on the treatment of indigenous
         peoples.</li>
       </ul>
       <ul>
        <li><strong>Agnes Baker Pilgrim</strong>, Chairman of the Council of Thirteen Indigenous
         Grandmothers, is the oldest known living female member of her tribe, the Takelma Indians,

         bachelor&amp;#8217;s degree in psychology and a minor in Native American Studies, she is a
         historian, storyteller and cultural instructor. She has been honored as a &amp;quot;Living
         Treasure&amp;quot; by her tribe the Confederated Tribes of Siletz, and as a
         &amp;quot;Living Cultural Legend&amp;quot; by the Oregon Council of the Arts.</li>
       </ul>
       <ul>
        <li><strong>Mona Polacca</strong> is a Hopi/Havasupai /Tewa elder. She has a Master of
         Social Work degree from Arizona State University where she is working on her Ph.D. in

         a non-profit program dedicated to promoting a vision of wellness by providing
         trans-cultural training to individuals, families, and healthcare professionals. Grandmother
         Polacca has worked on issues of Native American alcoholism, domestic violence and mental
         health for the elderly native peoples.</li>

       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>The week of events is presented by the Willi Unsoeld Seminar Series, The Evergreen
         State College Diversity Series and the Longhouse Education and Cultural Center, in
         collaboration with First Peoples&amp;#8217; Advising Services and academic programs across
         the college.&amp;#160;</strong>
       </p>
       <p><strong>The Willi Unsoeld Seminar Series</strong> welcomes distinguished visitors who
        reflect the values and philosophy of Willi Unsoeld, a founding Evergreen faculty member,
        philosopher, theologian and mountaineer. Unsoeld was well known for his first ascent of the
        West Ridge of Mt. Everest with Tom Hornbein, in which they made the first successful
        traverse of any Himalayan peak. For this feat, President John F. Kennedy presented them with
        the Hubbard Medal, The National Geographic Society&amp;#8217;s highest honor. The annual
        Unsoeld Seminar is endowed as a &amp;#8220;living memorial&amp;#8221; in honor of Willi
        Unsoeld who lost his life in an avalanche on Mt. Rainier in 1979.</p>
       <p><strong>The Diversity Series</strong> was established by Evergreen&amp;#8217;s Office for
        Diversity Affairs to engage the community in conversations about multicultural equity and
        social justice. The series serves to remind us that our communities are comprised of many
        cultures, and that everyone benefits when we rely on varied ways of being, knowing, teaching
        and learning.</p>
       <p><strong>The Longhouse Education and Cultural Center</strong> opened on the Olympia campus
        of The Evergreen State College in 1995. The Center&amp;#8217;s primary public service work
        is to promote indigenous arts and culture. In the beginning, the center focused on six local
        Puget Sound tribes and their artists; today staff work with indigenous artists throughout
        the Pacific Northwest region, nationally, and with other Pacific Rim indigenous peoples to
        promote indigenous arts and cultures through a wide variety of programs.</p>
       <p>We are honored that the Lucky Eagle Casino will provide the generous donation of food for
        the reception following the Welcome Ceremony and keynote presentation on Saturday May 2.</p>

       <p>The eastern part of Driftwood Road will be repaired and repaved starting next Tuesday,
        April 21, 2009 and it is expected to be completed by the end of May 2009. The contractor
        will be working Monday through Friday from 7:00 AM to 4:00 PM. The construction limit of
        this project begins at the intersection of Driftwood Road and Evergreen Parkway and ends at
        the intersection of Driftwood Road and Overhulse Road. Work includes road pavement and storm
        water system repairs, placing new Asphalt Concrete Pavement overlays and traffic
        striping.</p>
       <p>One lane will be worked on at a time in order to accommodate normal traffic with minimal
        delays. Flaggers will be directing and controlling traffic throughout the project. Intercity
        Transit will continue their normal services and maintain their normal routes and schedules
        in this area.</p>
       <p>Thanks for your understanding and patience as we implement this important project. Please

       <h2>The Evergreen State College is Noted as a Top Green Power Purchaser Among Colleges and
        Universities<br/>
       </h2>
       <p>Olympia, Wash, April 20, 2009 &amp;#8212; The Evergreen State College announced today that
        it was recognized by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency as the 2008-2009 Individual
        Conference Champion for purchasing more green power than any other school in the Cascade
        Collegiate Conference.</p>
       <p>Since April 2006, EPA&amp;#8217;s Green Power Partnership has tracked and recognized the
        collegiate athletic conferences with the highest combined green power purchases in the
        nation. The Individual Conference Champion Award recognizes the school that has made the
        largest individual purchase of green power within a qualifying conference.</p>
       <p>The Evergreen State College beat its conference rivals by purchasing more than 16 million
        kilowatt-hours (kWh) of green power, representing 100 percent of the school&amp;#8217;s
        annual electricity usage. The Evergreen State College is buying utility green power products
        from Puget Sound Energy and Tacoma Power, which helps to reduce the environmental impacts
        associated with the campus&amp;#8217;s purchased electricity use.</p>
       <p>EPA estimates that The Evergreen State College&amp;#8217;s purchase of more than 16
        million kilowatt-hours of green power is the equivalent amount of electricity needed to
        power more than 1,600 average American homes each year or has the equivalent impact of
        reducing the CO2 emissions of more than 2,100 passenger cars annually.</p>
       <p>The Cascade Collegiate Conference&amp;#8217;s collective green power purchase of more than
        31 million kWh of green power is equivalent to the annual electricity use of more than 2,600
        average American homes or the annual CO2 emissions of nearly 3,500 cars.</p>
       <p>&amp;#8220;Each year our college and university Green Power Partners raise the bar for
        clean, renewable energy use,&amp;#8221; said EPA Administrator Lisa P. Jackson.
        &amp;#8220;By taking action on its campus, Evergreen State College is helping to move our
        nation into a clean energy future.&amp;#8221;</p>
       <p>Twenty-two collegiate conferences and 44 schools competed in the 2008-2009 challenge,
        collectively purchasing more than 1 billion kWh of green power. EPA will extend the College
        &amp;#38; University Green Power Challenge for a fourth year, to conclude in spring of 2010.
        EPA&amp;#8217;s Green Power Challenge is open to all U.S. colleges, universities, and
        conferences. In order to qualify, a collegiate athletic conference must include at least one
        school that qualifies as a Green Power Partner, and the conference must collectively meet
        EPA&amp;#8217;s minimum conference purchase requirement. For more information, visit:
        http://www.epa.gov/grnpower/initiatives/cu_challenge.htm.</p>
       <p>Green power is generated from renewable resources such as solar, wind, geothermal, biogas,
        biomass and low-impact hydro. Green power is considered cleaner than conventional sources of
        electricity and has lower carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, a greenhouse gas linked to global
        climate change. Purchases of green power help accelerate the development of new renewable
        energy capacity nationwide.</p>
       <p>From edible forest gardens to a salmon-safe certified organic farm to campus housing
        options in which students consciously choose a different way to relate to their natural
        world, Evergreen provides students with the opportunity to embark on new ways of thinking.
        Purchasing Green Power is an important part of Evergreen&amp;#8217;s commitment to
        sustainability.</p>
       <h5>About The Evergreen State College</h5>
       <p>The Evergreen State College is a nationally recognized public liberal arts college known
        for its distinctive interdisciplinary curriculum, high level of student/faculty engagement

       <h5>About the U.S. EPA&amp;#8217;s Green Power Partnership</h5>
       <p>EPA&amp;#8217;s Green Power Partnership encourages organizations to purchase green power
        as a way to reduce the environmental impacts associated with conventional electricity use.
        The Green Power Partnership currently has more than 1,000 Partners voluntarily purchasing
        billions of kilowatt hours of green power annually. Partners include a wide variety of
        leading organizations such as Fortune 500 companies, small and medium sized businesses,
        local, state, and federal governments, trade associations, as well as colleges and
        universities. For additional information please visit <a

       <h4>Synergy to Highlight Nationally Renowned Speakers and Presentations by Experts in
        Ecology, Technology, Culture, Health, and Social Change</h4>
       <p>Synergy: The 8th Annual Sustainable Living Conference is being held at The Evergreen State
        College in Olympia, Washington. The dates for the 2009 conference are Wednesday, May 6th
        through Friday, May 8th.</p>

       <h3>Purce, Doc Watson to Receive Honorary Degrees at May 16 Ceremony</h3>
       <p>UNC Asheville Chancellor Anne Ponder will confer honorary doctoral degrees on Evergreen
        State College President Thomas "Les" Purce and legendary musician Arthel "Doc" Watson at the
        University's spring Commencement Ceremony. The ceremony will be held at 9 a.m. Saturday, May
        16, on UNC Asheville's Quad. Purce will give the commencement address to some 385
        graduates.</p>
       <p>Purce has served as president of The Evergreen State College in Olympia, Wash., a
        nationally recognized public liberal arts institution, for nine years. Purce has also held
        top-ranking administrative roles at Washington State University and Idaho State University.
        He has been a civic leader as well. Purce was the first black elected official in Idaho,
        serving as city councilman and then mayor of Pocatello. He later served as director of
        Idaho&amp;#8217;s departments of Administration and Health &amp; Welfare. In the private
        sector, Purce was partner and CEO of Power Engineering Inc., a large electrical engineering
        firm in the Northwest.</p>
       <p>Purce has helped guide The Evergreen State College into its national reputation for
        interdisciplinary academic programs serving some 4,400 students. Instead of letter grades,
        professors give individual written evaluations; and rather than choosing a department or
        major, students design their own curriculums. Evergreen's 1,000-acre campus, including
        forests and salt water beaches, serve as inspiration for the college's dedication to
        sustainability. For example, a self-imposed student fee dictates that 100% of the college's
        electricity comes from "green" sources, L.E.E.D. gold certified buildings make up the
        campus, and more than a quarter of the food served in the dining hall is from local or
        organic sources.</p>
       <p>Watson, a native of Western North Carolina, is a legendary guitar player, songwriter, and
        singer of bluegrass, folk and country music. Blind since the age of one, Watson attended
        North Carolina&amp;#8217;s school for the visually impaired in Raleigh. Though he did well
        in the classroom, his true love was music. Watson got his big career break at the Newport
        Folk Festival in 1963, and recorded his first solo album the following year. He has toured
        and recorded to rave reviews ever since.</p>
       <p>His signature playing style and traditional mountain roots propelled Watson to an
        award-winning, patriarchal role in the American folk and bluegrass music revival. He has won
        seven Grammy Awards as well as a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award. In 1997, Watson was
        given the National Medal of the Arts from President Clinton and in 2000 he was inducted into
        the International Bluegrass Music Hall of Fame. But perhaps one of his most lasting marks on
        live music was the founding of the popular MerleFest music festival held every April in
        Wilkesboro, N.C. The festival, named in honor of Watson&amp;#8217;s late son, draws more
        than 85,000 fans each year. Even at age 86, Watson continues to serve as festival host and
        center stage performer.</p>

       <h3>Top Independent College Guide Introduces the Best Buy Schools of 2010</h3>
       <p>The updated 2010 edition of Fiske Guide to Colleges features 44 Best Buy Schools. These
        institutions are selected based on the quality of academic offerings in relation to the cost
        of attendance. The Evergreen State College is a Fiske 2010 Best Buy School.</p>
       <p>The list of Best Buy Schools&amp;#8212;which doesn&amp;#8217;t rank the schools against
        each other&amp;#8212;evaluates more than 330 colleges and universities in the United States,
        Canada and the United Kingdom.</p>
       <p>Fiske researchers combined cost data with academic and other life-style information about
        each college or university to determine what institutions offer "remarkable educational
        opportunities at a relatively modest cost."</p>
       <p>
        <strong>The Fiske Guide accepts no consulting, advertising or other fees from
         colleges.</strong>

        connection to the natural world. Whyte studied Marine Zoology in Wales and trained as a
        naturalist in the Galapagos Islands. Whyte has worked as a naturalist guide, leading
        anthropological and natural history expeditions in various parts of the world, including

        creativity into the field of organizational development, conducting workshops with many
        American and international companies. In corporate settings, Whyte uses poetry to bring an
        understanding of the process of change, helping clients to understand individual and
        organizational creativity, and to apply that understanding to vitalize and transform the
        workplace.</p>

       <p>The Evergreen State College is one of the country's best institutions for undergraduate
        education, according to The Princeton Review. The education services company features the
        school in the new 2010 edition of its popular guidebook, "The Best 371 Colleges" (Random
        House / Princeton Review, July 28, 2009).</p>
       <p>Only about 15% of America&amp;#8217;s 2,500 four-year colleges and two Canadian colleges
        are profiled in the book, which is The Princeton Review's flagship annual college guide. It
        includes detailed profiles of the colleges with school rating scores in eight categories,
        plus ranking lists of top 20 schools in 62 categories based on The Princeton Review's
        surveys of students attending the colleges.</p>
       <p>Says Robert Franek, Princeton Review's V.P., Publishing and author of "The Best 371
        Colleges," "We commend The Evergreen State College for its outstanding academics, which is
        the primary criteria for our choice of schools for the book. We also work to keep a wide
        representation of colleges in the book by region, size, selectivity and character. We make
        our choices based on institutional data we gather about schools, feedback from students
        attending them, and input from our staff who visit hundreds of colleges a year. We also
        value the opinions and suggestions of our 23-member National College Counselor Advisory
        Board, and independent college counselors we hear from yearlong."</p>
       <p>In its profile on The Evergreen State College, The Princeton Review praises the school for
        its focus on interdisciplinary education, its strength in environmental studies, and its
        strong emphasis on collaborative learning. The Princeton Review quotes from Evergreen
        students. Among their comments about their campus experiences: "the professors at Evergreen
        are more than teachers, they are your partner in education and dedicate themselves to
        facilitating the students&amp;#8217; learning."</p>
       <p>The Princeton Review's 62 ranking lists in "The Best 371 Colleges" are entirely based on
        its survey of 122,000 students (about 325 per campus on average) attending the colleges in
        the book. The 80-question survey asks students to rate their schools on several topics and
        report on their campus experiences at them. Topics range from student assessments of their
        professors, administrators, financial aid, and campus food. Other ranking lists are based on
        student reports about their student body's political leanings, race/class relations, gay
        community acceptance, and other aspects of campus life.</p>
       <p>The school profiles in "The Best 371 Colleges" also have ratings that are based largely on
        institutional data that The Princeton Review collected during the 2008-09 academic year. The
        ratings are scores on a scale of 60 to 99 that are tallied in eight categories. Among them
        are ratings for Admissions Selectivity, Financial Aid, and Green, a rating The Princeton
        Review introduced in 2008 that is a measure of school's commitment to environmentally
        related policies, practices and education. The Evergreen State College ranked 99 (the
        highest possible score) on the Green Rating, placing it among only 15 schools on the Green
        Rating Honor Roll.</p>
       <p>The Princeton Review posts the school profiles and ranking lists in "The Best 371
        Colleges" on its site at which users can read FAQs about the book, the survey, and the
        criteria for each of the ratings and rankings.</p>
       <p>"The Best 371 Colleges" is the 18th edition of The Princeton Review's annual "best
        colleges" book. Over the years, the book and its ranking lists have been favorably cited by
        former President Bill Clinton, former Vice President Dick Cheney, and former Secretary of
        Education Margaret Spellings (among others).</p>
       <p>The schools in "The Best 371 Colleges" are also part of 640 colleges and universities that
        The Princeton Review commends in its website feature, "2010 Best Colleges: Region by Region
        - Northeast / Midwest / Southeast / West."</p>
       <p>The Princeton Review (<a href="http://www.PrincetonReview.com"
        >www.PrincetonReview.com</a>) is known for its tutoring and classroom test preparation
        courses, books, and college and graduate school admission services. Its corporate
        headquarters is in Framingham, MA, and editorial offices are in New York City. It is not
        affiliated with Princeton University and it is not a magazine.</p>

       <h3>Tribal Journeys 2009 &amp;#8216;Paddle to Suquamish&amp;#8217; to Welcome Canoes as They
        Arrive on Monday, August 3, 2009, 1 p.m.</h3>
       <p>The Maori artist Takirirangi Smith who crafted The Longhouse Education and Cultural
        Center&amp;#8217;s first waka (war canoe) at The Evergreen State College is returning for
        Tribal Journeys 2009 featuring canoes and international cultural activities at end of
        journey events from Monday August 3, 2009 until Saturday August 8, 2009 in Suquamish,
        Washington.</p>
       <p>Canoes will arrive at 1:00 p.m. on August 3 at the new community house, &amp;#8220;The
        House of Awakened Culture&amp;#8221; that is located near the waterfront in downtown
        Suquamish. The event on the Port Madison Reservation in North Kitsap County will feature
        cultural events, learning adventures and family entertainment.</p>
       <p>The Canoe Journey is a time of healing, hope, happiness, honor and hospitality. People
        attending the event can expect to be thrilled at the sight of a bay filled with beautifully
        carved canoes coming in to land.</p>
       <p>The events mark the 20th anniversary of the historical 1989 &amp;#8220;Paddle to
        Seattle.&amp;#8221; This was the first traditional intertribal canoe voyage in over a
        hundred years, leaving the shores of Suquamish for Seattle. The 1989 Journey with nine
        canoes continues this year in central Puget Sound with approximately 80 canoes expected to
        participate.</p>
       <p>Mr. Takirirangi will paddle the waka carved with fellow artist John Smith. The waka
        usually resides at The Evergreen State College Longhouse Education and Cultural Center.</p>
       <p>Canoes will arrive in Suquamish from diverse locations including Hood Canal,
        Washington&amp;#8217;s West Coast, Mainland BC, the San Juan Islands, Westcoast Vancouver
        Islands and the Inside Passage of British Columbia.</p>

        <li>Green Honor Roll Salutes 15 Colleges, Among them The Evergreen State College, for
         Receiving Highest Rating Score of 99</li>
       </ul>
       <p>NEW YORK, July 27, 2009, Noon EDT -- The Princeton Review &amp;#8211; known for its
        education services helping students choose and get into colleges -- today reported its
        second annual Green Ratings of colleges: a measure of how environmentally friendly the
        institutions are on a scale of 60 to 99. The company tallied its Green Ratings for 697
        institutions based on data it collected from the colleges in 2008-09 concerning their
        environmentally related policies, practices, and academic offerings.</p>
       <p>The Princeton Review named 15 colleges to its "2010 Green Rating Honor Roll" &amp;#8211; a
        list that salutes the institutions that received the highest possible score &amp;#8211; 99
        &amp;#8211; in this year's rating tallies.</p>
       <h2>The Princeton Review&amp;#8217;s "2010 Green Rating Honor Roll"</h2>
       <p>This list, published in "The Best 371 Colleges," salutes 15 institutions (eight private
        and seven public colleges) that received the highest possible rating score of 99. It
        includes:</p>
       <p>(in alphabetical order)</p>
       <ul>
        <li>Arizona State University at the Tempe campus</li>
        <li>Bates College (Lewiston ME)</li>
        <li>Binghamton University (State Univ. of New York at Binghamton)</li>
        <li>College of the Atlantic (Bar Harbor ME)</li>
        <li>Colorado College (Colorado Springs CO)</li>
        <li>Dickinson College (Carlisle PA)</li>
        <li>
         <strong>The Evergreen State College (Olympia WA)</strong>
        </li>
        <li>Georgia Institute of Technology (Atlanta)</li>
        <li>Harvard College (Cambridge MA)</li>
        <li>Middlebury College (Middlebury VT)</li>
        <li>Northeastern University (Boston MA)</li>
        <li>University of California - Berkeley</li>
        <li>University of New Hampshire (Durham)</li>
        <li>University of Washington (Seattle)</li>
        <li>Yale University (New Haven CT)</li>
       </ul>
       <p>Said Robert Franek, V.P. / Publisher, The Princeton Review, "The 'green' movement on
        college campuses is far more than an Earth Day recycling project. It is growing tremendously
        among students and administrators alike. This year we saw a 30% increase in the number of
        colleges participating in our Green Rating survey. We thank the nearly 700 institutions (697
        vs. 534 last year) that supplied us with the data we requested to tally their scores. Many
        have shown extraordinary commitments to environmental issues and to the environment in their
        practices and programs. We are pleased to play a role in helping students who care deeply
        about these issues identify, get into, and study at these schools."</p>
       <p>Franek noted the rising interest among students in attending colleges that practice, teach
        and support environmentally responsible choices. Among almost 16,000 college applicants and
        parents of applicants The Princeton Review surveyed this year for its annual "College Hopes
        &amp; Worries Survey," 66% of respondents overall (and 68% of students vs. 59% of parents)
        said they would value having information about a college's commitment to the environment
        &amp;#8211; a 4% increase from last year's respondents. Among that cohort, 24% of
        respondents overall (26% of students vs. 18% of parents) said such information would "very
        much" impact their (their child's) decision to apply to or attend the school.</p>
       <p>The Princeton Review has dedicated a resource area on its website for students and others
        interested in learning more about the rating and the benefits of attending a green college.
        The area has information on colleges with exemplary environmental programs, questions to ask
        on school visits, and links to organizations that promote higher education and campus
        sustainability programs.</p>
       <h2>Criteria</h2>
       <p>The Princeton Review developed its Green Rating criteria and institutional survey in 2007
        with ecoAmerica , a non-profit environmental organization that continues to participate in
        this project. The criteria for the rating cover three broad areas: 1/ whether the
        school&amp;#8217;s students have a campus quality of life that is healthy and sustainable,
        2/ how well the school is preparing its students for employment and citizenship in a world
        defined by environmental challenges, and 3/ the school's overall commitment to environmental
        issues. The institutional survey for the rating included ten questions on everything from
        energy use, recycling, food, buildings, and transportation to academic offerings
        (availability of environmental studies degrees and courses) and action plans and goals
        concerning greenhouse gas emission reductions.</p>
       <h2>About The Princeton Review College Ratings and College Rankings</h2>
       <p>The Green Rating scores appear in the profiles of the 697 schools that The Princeton
        Review posted today on its site, . The ratings are also in profiles of those schools in the
        2010 editions of three Princeton Review books: "The Best 371 Colleges" (on sale July 28,
        $22.99), "The Best Northeastern Colleges" (on sale August 4, $16.99), and "Complete Book of
        Colleges" (on sale August 4, $26.99), all published by Random House.</p>
       <p>The Princeton Review college ratings are scores on a scale of 60 to 99 in eight categories
        that it reports in some college profiles on its website and in its college guides. The
        ratings are based primarily on institutional data. In addition to the Green Rating, other
        rating categories include: Financial Aid, and Fire Safety (for which The Princeton Review
        also reports Honor Rolls of schools receiving its highest possible score of 99), and
        Admissions Selectivity. Schools from which The Princeton Review does not receive sufficient
        data in a category to tally a rating receive a score of 60* (sixty with an asterisk).</p>
       <p>The Princeton Review college rankings are lists of schools in 62 categories (in rank order
        1 to 20) based entirely on the Company's surveys of 122,000 students attending the schools
        in its book, "The Best 371 Colleges." The survey asks students to rate their own schools on
        dozens of topics and report on their campus experiences at them.</p>

       <h2>Climate Neutrality with Honours</h2>
       <h2>Universities Join UN-led Initiative to Combat Climate Change</h2>
       <p>Nairobi, 23 July 2009 - Six universities from the US, UK, Spain and China have become the
        first academic institutions to come on board the Climate Neutral Network (CN Net) - an
        initiative led by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) to promote global action
        to de-carbonize our economies and societies.</p>
       <p>They are the pioneers among hundreds of universities, colleges and other academic
        institutions worldwide that are taking steps to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, promote
        "greening" of their campuses and invest in low-carbon research and development.</p>
       <p>UN Under-Secretary-General and UNEP Executive Director Achim Steiner said: "The Climate
        Neutral Network was inspired by a simple idea that a transformation to a low, even zero
        emission future is a learning process. It is therefore fitting that universities from all
        over the world should join this global networking platform and help make the best knowledge
        on climate neutrality available to all."</p>
       <p>"As think tanks, creativity hubs and change agents in our societies, we welcome
        universities on board the CN Net and hope that they will bring their vast libraries of
        knowledge to the Network and use it to accelerate the global transition to a low-carbon,
        resource-efficient future."</p>
       <p>From using renewable sources of energy such as wind, sun and biomass to developing fuel
        cell vehicles to encouraging neighbouring communities to take on the low carbon challenge,
        the new CN Net participants are taking leadership on the issue of climate change at the
        local, national and international levels.</p>
       <p>In the United States alone, 645 colleges and universities are moving towards climate
        neutrality as part of the American College &amp; University Presidents Climate Commitment
        (ACUPCC), and many of these schools are perfect candidates for the CN Net.</p>
       <p>"Colleges and universities are arguably the most important institutions to address climate
        disruption because they can model climate neutrality on their campuses, and they can teach
        their students the skills and knowledge they need to address the climate crisis," said
        Anthony D. Cortese, coordinator of the ACUPCC and president of Second Nature - a nonprofit
        organization working to help colleges and universities make the principles of sustainability
        fundamental to every aspect of higher education.</p>
       <h3>The first universities that have joined the Climate Neutral Network are:</h3>
       <p><strong>College of the Atlantic, Maine (USA):</strong> The College was founded in 1969 on
        the premise that education should go beyond understanding the world as it is, to enabling
        students to actively shape its future. It has pioneered a special interdisciplinary approach
        to undergraduate education - human ecology - with the view to developing the types of
        leaders needed by all sectors of society in addressing the compelling and growing human
        needs of our world. College of the Atlantic has been carbon neutral since December 19, 2007.
        It achieved this by reducing and avoiding its greenhouse gases emissions, and by carefully
        calculating all other emissions (including that of visitors to campus), which are offset.
        All electricity is now purchased from a low-impact hydroelectric generator in Maine, and a
        wind turbine powers the farmhouse on the college's outlying organic farm (which supplies
        some of the produce to the college's dining hall). The college has completed an energy
        audit, established a bicycle plan, encourages telecommuting when possible and has switched
        all possible incandescent light bulbs to compact fluorescent bulbs.</p>
       <p><strong>Evergreen State College, Washington (USA):</strong> The Evergreen State College
        has established a national reputation for leadership in developing innovative
        interdisciplinary academic programs. Evergreen has been a leader in environmental education
        from the beginning, and in recent years, the College has advanced its commitment to
        sustainability. Evergreen is engaging the local, regional and global community to
        demonstrate and enact clear policies to address the world-changing challenges of climate
        change. The College has set a goal of reaching carbon neutrality by 2020 and currently
        purchases 16 million kilowatt-hours (kWh) from renewable energy sources, representing 100
        percent of the school's annual electricity usage. The US Environmental Protection Agency
        estimates that Evergreen State College's purchase of more than 16 million kilowatt-hours of
        green power is the equivalent amount of electricity needed to power more than 1,600 average
        American homes each year or has the equivalent impact of reducing the CO2 emissions of more
        than 2,100 passenger cars annually. Furthermore, Evergreen's most recent energy savings and
        conservation plan will reduce carbon output by 500 tonnes and save $73,000 per year.</p>
       <p><strong>Malaga University (Spain):</strong> Malaga University (UMA) is a public
        institution which promotes outstanding research and teaching within the European Higher
        Education Area. With a university community of just over 40,000 people, over the last decade
        UMA has sought to promote the internationalization of its teaching. UMA offers an extensive
        catalogue of specialized teaching and postgraduate study with particular focus on urban
        biodiversity. In the sustainability field, Malaga University has created a solar thermal
        surface of 2000 m2 for a renewable energy heating source. The University is also in the
        process of building a solar photovoltaic panel surface of 8000 m2 with a production capacity
        of 1 megawatt with plans to eventually use geothermal energy with a tri-generation plant on
        the campus. In the year 2012, Malaga University will finish subway transportation between
        the Central City and the University City. In addition, the university plans to introduce
        more sustainable transportation (bicycles, hybrid vehicles) and create 264.905 m2 of urban
        forest and green zones.</p>
       <p><strong>Middlebury College, Vermont (USA):</strong> Middlebury is ranked as one of the top
        liberal arts colleges in the United States. It offers its students a broad curriculum
        embracing the arts, humanities, literature, foreign languages, social sciences, and natural
        sciences. Middlebury is an institution with a long-standing international focus, a place
        where education reflects a sense of looking outward. Indeed, the college claims that the
        central purpose of a Middlebury education is precisely to transcend oneself and one's own
        concerns-for some through the study of the environment. Middlebury College has set a goal of
        carbon neutrality by 2016. The implementation strategy adopted by the College relies on a
        switch of the fuels it uses for heating, cooling and cooking from fossil based to
        renewables. Toward that end, the College recently built a $12 million biomass gasification
        system which uses wood chips from nearby forests and mills. This has cut Middlebury
        College's carbon footprint by 40%, or 12,500 metric tonnes, cut fuel costs by $750,000/yr.
        and has put $800,000 new money into the local economy.</p>
       <p><strong>Tongji University, Shanghai (China):</strong> Tongji University was established in
        1907 and is one of the oldest leading universities in China, operating under the State
        Ministry of Education. It offers degree programs both at undergraduate and postgraduate
        levels, including a School of Environmental Science and Engineering and an Institute of
        Environment for Sustainable Development, which was created in partnership with UNEP. The
        name Tongji signifies "cooperating by riding the same boat." Tongji University certainly
        understands that we are all part of a global "boat" that needs to deal with the rising tide
        of climate change and Tongji has begun developing green technologies. The Tongji Fuel Cell
        Vehicle Engineering Center helped develop fuel cell vehicles, which are now being tested in
        a six-month road testing in California. Principals of Tongji Fuel Cell Vehicle Engineering
        Center have expressed that this was the first time for China's fuel cell vehicles to
        participate in international demonstrations. These fuel cell-powered sedans can reach 150
        miles per hour and cover up to 300 miles after one Hydrogen charging. Tongji University also
        uses solar energy, reuses water, and has energy-saving technologies. In the Wenyuan
        Building, the university does not only maintain the historical features of the building, but
        also builds the concept of eco-building by using technologies such as geo-heat pumps,
        thermal insulation systems, rainwater collection and recycling systems.</p>
       <p><strong>University of the West of England, Bristol (UK):</strong> The University is
        committed to a range of actions that address climate change through its Sustainability
        Strategy for 2008 to 2012, including clear reductions of greenhouse gas emissions. The
        University developed a carbon management plan in partnership with the Carbon Trust that aims
        to progressively reduce dependency on fossil fuels and contribute to achieving the UK target
        of an 80% reduction in carbon dioxide emissions by 2050. From 2006 to 2007, the University
        reduced its carbon emissions by more than 23%. Some aspects of their strategy involve
        calculating the University's carbon commitment, reducing energy use in buildings,
        encouraging public transportation, and implementing an energy awareness campaign. The
        University is also a founding member of the West of England Carbon Challenge, an innovative
        project that is challenging all businesses, public and third sector bodies in the Bristol
        city-region to commit to making an annual cut in emissions for four years to reach a
        cumulative total of at least 10% by 2012.</p>
       <h3>Quotes from some of the new CN Net members:</h3>
       <p>"We are pleased to have this opportunity to join with a global effort to reduce greenhouse
        gas emissions." - Scott Morgan, Office of Sustainability, Evergreen State College</p>
       <p>"Middlebury College has set a goal of achieving carbon neutrality by 2016 for several
        important reasons. We recognized early on that the threats of climate change are serious and
        that they can only be addressed through coordinated local and international efforts by all
        sectors of society. By taking leadership on this issue we are expressing that concern and
        showing that there are solutions that make sense from a sustainability perspective -
        solutions that reduce greenhouse gas emissions, improve the local economy, and strengthen
        the vitality and health of surrounding communities. We joined CN Net because it provides a
        means for adding our voice and our examples of leadership to a growing international
        movement to take substantive, effective action to address the challenge of climate change."
        - Jack Byrne, Director, Sustainability Integration Office, Middlebury College</p>
       <p>"The University of the West of England, Bristol is delighted to support the UN's Climate
        Neutral Network. We look forward to actively participating, learning from the successes of
        fellow members and sharing the outcomes of the actions that we have taken to reduce our own
        carbon dependency. Joining this new Network is further evidence of the University's strong
        commitment to sustainability. The University is already taking vigorous action to reduce the
        carbon footprint of its operations - we cut gas consumption by 46% between 2006 and 2007 -
        and we seek to ensure that our students - the leaders and thinkers of tomorrow - are aware
        of the challenges and opportunities of creating a sustainable and low-carbon future. We also
        carry out key research into climate change issues through an Institute dedicated to
        sustainability. In addition we are responding strategically to the challenges of
        sustainability and climate change via a Sustainability Board, chaired by the Deputy Vice
        Chancellor." - Professor James Longhurst, Associate Dean and Professor of Environmental
        Science, University of the West of England, Bristol</p>

       <p>The Sustainability Council at The Evergreen State College has set a goal: the Evergreen
        campus will generate zero landfill waste by 2020. Some may see this goal as impossible.
        Others, such as the members of the Sustainability Council, see this goal as not only
        possible, but essential. Landfills across the country are quickly nearing capacity, and in
        response Greeners are taking action.</p>
       <p>In order to reduce landfill trash on campus, Greeners have turned to reusing, recycling
        and composting waste instead. The Evergreen Organic Farm, and Silver Springs Organics, a
        local commercial composting facility, picks up an average of 6000 lbs. of compost each week.
        At present, Silver Springs accepts the bulk of it; however, many Greeners hope to see the
        Organic Farm expand its compost capabilities in the future.</p>
       <p>During the winter academic quarter, Evergreen took part in a national competition called
        RecycleMania. Students, staff and faculty joined efforts to better educate people on proper
        recycling practices. During the 10 week competition, a group of students, staff and faculty
        met bi-weekly to coordinate waste reduction efforts across campus. With the help of Sherry
        Parsons in the office of Facilities Services, coordinators Lindsay Raab, Natalie Pyrooz and
        Halli Winstead tracked the weights of campus landfill trash, recycling and compost over the
        10 week period; the results were then posted on the Evergreen Sustainability website. The
        RecycleMania team held two waste audits on campus that served as educational tools for
        everyone involved. Recyclable waste in landfill trash bins was weighed and recorded on a
        chalkboard for everyone to view, and later analyzed and communicated to the campus
        community. Other RecycleMania activities included weekly email trivia, creating art from
        discarded materials, and fieldtrips to Silver Springs Organics.</p>
       <p>Students and staff in Residential and Dining (RAD) Services also took steps toward zero
        landfill waste. When college students move out of their dorm rooms at the end of each
        academic year, a lot of landfill waste is created. In its effort to strive toward campus
        sustainability, Evergreen sought ways to mitigate this influx of refuse by offering
        alternatives for usable and recyclable goods.</p>
       <p>In June 2009, RAD Services was able to divert waste both from students moving out, and
        from the apartment remodeling project. Reusable goods that student residents did not want to
        take home were collected by the PODS project (portable on-demand storage), sorted, and
        donated to local non-profits. This project, in its fourth year, is organized by Resident
        Director Melissa Turkington. Preliminary observations indicate that collections doubled
        since last year. The program is exemplary in thoughtfully giving back to the community
        rather than ignoring the environmental and social implications of adding volume to
        landfills.</p>
       <p>New this year, RAD Services was able to donate much of its old furniture that is being
        replaced due to remodeling some of the apartments. As policy dictates, these goods typically
        have gone to state surplus in previous years. However, due to the age and condition of the
        furniture, surplus has not been able to sell these goods, which then may end up at a
        recycler or possibly in the landfill. Through an agreement with state surplus based on past
        experiences, RAD Services sought out non-profits who would be able to reuse the goods. RAD
        Services was able to donate most of the furniture to local non-profits, and recycle
        approximately 80% of the remodeling waste.</p>
       <p>The Waste Reduction and Sustainable Purchasing Work Group of the Sustainability Council at
        Evergreen continues to focus on two main goals. The first goal is to influence
        Evergreen&amp;#8217;s purchasing decisions toward products and services that are more
        environmentally friendly. Evergreen's paper usage has decreased almost 25% since fiscal year
        2006. &amp;#8220;Double-sided printing is encouraged, as well as going
        &amp;#8216;paperless&amp;#8217; as often as possible,&amp;#8221; said Kathleen Haskett,
        Purchasing and Contracts Manager. &amp;#8220;Many faculty are teaching class without
        distributing or requiring paper; digital media is used whenever possible.&amp;#8221; In
        addition, the Library and computer labs on campus use a print management system to lessen
        accidental duplicate printing. The college purchases 100% post consumer recycled content,
        chlorine/acid free paper, manufactured with 100% certified renewable energy by Grays Harbor
        Paper of Hoquiam. In addition, Kathleen has proposed a revised purchasing policy for the
        college that will further support sustainability.</p>
       <p>The work group&amp;#8217;s second goal focuses on reducing and recycling as much waste as
        possible, particularly electronic waste. Aaron Powell, Director of Computing and
        Communications, is drafting an e-waste policy to present to the Policy Oversight Group in
        the near future. Powell and others across campus continue to work on reducing the amount of
        printers on campus, and experimenting with green products, such as soy based ink.</p>
       <p>It is an ongoing process to update signs, educate people, and keep up-to-date on proper
        sustainable practices. Sustainability on campus requires effort on both an institutional and
        individual level. Greeners face many obstacles working toward sustainability on campus, yet
        they continue to make progress toward their goal of zero landfill waste. For more

       <ul>
        <li>The Evergreen State College included in &amp;#8216;America&amp;#8217;s Best
         Colleges&amp;#8217;</li>
        <li>Evergreen receives accolades for its commitment to teaching and for its
         &amp;#8220;learning community&amp;#8221; approach.</li>
        <li>America&amp;#8217;s Best Colleges recognition latest in a series of strong showings for
         Evergreen in college rankings.</li>
       </ul>
       <p>The Evergreen State College has been recognized among top colleges in the 2010 edition of
        America&amp;#8217;s Best Colleges by U.S. News Media Group. The popular rankings, which
        include more than 1,400 schools nationwide, are available at <a
         href="http://www.usnews.com/colleges">http://www.usnews.com/colleges</a> and will also be
        published in the September issue of the <em>U.S. News &amp; World Report</em> magazine.</p>
       <p>Evergreen was categorized among the best universities with options for Masters Degrees in
        the Western Region.</p>
       <p>Evergreen was also recognized in the accompanying article &amp;#8220;A Strong commitment
        to teaching&amp;#8221; which noted the college as a top college and the only public college
        in the West that was identified for its &amp;#8220;unusual commitment to undergraduate
        teaching&amp;#8221; as measured by a peer assessment survey conducted by <em>U.S. News &amp;
         World Report</em>.</p>
       <p>Evergreen&amp;#8217;s distinctive &amp;#8220;learning communities&amp;#8221; approach was
        also highlighted by a peer assessment survey conducted by US News. Under the category
        &amp;#8220;learning communities,&amp;#8221; in the article &amp;#8220;Programs to look
        for&amp;#8221; Evergreen was listed among only 26 nationwide. Learning communities are a way
        of structuring curriculum to link together coursework so students find greater coherence in
        what they are learning and achieve more interactions with faculty and peers.</p>
       <p>Over the past 26 years, the <em>U.S. News</em> college rankings, which group schools based
        on categories created by the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching, has grown
        as a research tool for students and parents considering higher education opportunities.</p>
       <p>The Evergreen State College is a public liberal arts and sciences college that
        consistently achieves national recognition--most recently from <em>The Princeton Review, The
         Fiske Guide to Colleges</em>, and <em>Sierra Magazine</em> -- for its distinctively
        rigorous and thoughtful educational model, affordable price and commitment to
        sustainability. More on other recent awards is available here: <a

       <h2>The Evergreen State College praised for green efforts by national magazine, ranks sixth
        on list</h2>
       <p>Sierra magazine has named the nation&amp;#8217;s top 20 &amp;#8220;coolest&amp;#8221;
        schools for their efforts to stop global warming and operate sustainably. From
        Harvard&amp;#8217;s 17 LEED-certified buildings to Penn&amp;#8217;s biodiesel recyclers, the
        magazine&amp;#8217;s September/October cover story spotlights the schools that are making a
        true impact for the planet, and marks Sierra&amp;#8217;s third annual listing of
        America&amp;#8217;s greenest universities and colleges. The complete list is available
        online at <a href="http://www.sierraclub.org/coolschools"
         >http://www.sierraclub.org/coolschools</a></p>
       <p>The Evergreen State College placed sixth on the list. Initiatives at the college include a
        pervasive focus on working toward sustainability and justice by integrating these topics
        into the graduate and undergraduate curriculum and student academic experiences, leadership
        in environmental design and organic agriculture, and sound conservation policies, including
        protection and preservation of natural spaces on campus.</p>
       <p>&amp;#8220;We're thrilled to see The Evergreen State College making a real commitment to
        greening its campus,&amp;#8221; said Carl Pope, the Sierra Club&amp;#8217;s executive
        director. &amp;#8220;The next generation of students cares deeply about stopping global
        warming, and schools like Evergreen that take the initiative to become environmentally
        responsible are doing the right thing for the planet and are better poised to attract the
        best students.&amp;#8221;</p>
       <p>The announcement comes just weeks after the Princeton Review noted Evergreen as one of its
        15 &amp;#8216;Green Honor Roll&amp;#8217; colleges for receiving a score of 99, the highest
        possible green rating score possible. More on this:
        http://www.evergreen.edu/news/archive/2009/07/princeton</p>
       <p>This year&amp;#8217;s top-20 coolest schools are taking dramatic steps to curb climate
        change. Whether it&amp;#8217;s UCLA, with 38,476 students, The Evergreen State College with
        its 4,696 students, or the College of the Atlantic with 321 students, Sierra&amp;#8217;s
        list shows that schools of all sizes are taking action.</p>

     <title>You Can Help Shorten KAOS Fall Membership Drive. . .</title>
     <summary>Here’s how it works: for every $4000.00 in paid memberships KAOS receives before 5pm
      Wednesday October 14, KAOS will shorten the drive by one day. If KAOS gets enough paid
      memberships to eliminate the entire nine days – they will eliminate the 2009 Fall membership
      drive and get right back to music, news and information.</summary>

       <p>United Way of Thurston County will celebrate its 17th annual Day of Caring this Friday,
        September 25th. This year&amp;#8217;s event is bigger and more collaborative than ever,
        thanks to a partnership with The Evergreen State College and the Volunteer Center of Lewis,
        Mason &amp; Thurston Counties.</p>
       <p>"Day of Caring is an annual United Way event that matches volunteers with community
        service projects at local nonprofit and community organizations. This year our volunteers
        have increased by 30 percent to more than 600 individuals working on 48 different projects,
        due to our collaboration with The Evergreen State College and the Volunteer Center. Day of
        Caring also officially kicks off United Way&amp;#8217;s 2009 giving campaign, with a goal is
        to raise $1.4 million to help meet local human service needs," Pam Toal, Executive Director
        reports.</p>
       <p>Ellen Shortt Sanchez, Director of the Evergreen Center for Community Based Learning and
        Action, states, "Evergreen has a 20-year history of encouraging new students to engage with
        the community. Community to Community service day is an activity during new student
        orientation week. Collaborating with United Way and the Volunteer Center, students will join
        Day of Caring sites to learn about community needs. The Evergreen Center for Community Based
        Learning and Action and the academic program Community Connections are encouraging students
        to respond to national problems with local solutions. We are expecting 150 students to
        volunteer at 16 local organizations."</p>
       <p>This year the Volunteer Center managed the project and team database and helped United Way
        develop many new and innovative projects to engage volunteers in meaningful work. Examples
        include "On Board!," a class for people who are interested in joining a nonprofit board of
        directors, and "Building Bridges," another class where individuals can learn how to
        volunteer effectively with low-income families and individuals. Finally, United
        Way&amp;#8217;s Women&amp;#8217;s Leadership Council members are providing one-on-one
        mentoring with girls at the local Boys and Girls Clubs of Thurston County.</p>
       <p>"We really wanted to develop a portfolio of volunteer opportunities for this
        year&amp;#8217;s Day of Caring," said Sara Ballard, Executive Director of the Volunteer
        Center. "It&amp;#8217;s important for people to see that they can help in a variety of ways.
        We worked hand in hand with businesses and community organizations to create unique projects
        for this year&amp;#8217;s event."</p>

       <p>(Olympia, Wash) More wild salmon could soon be swimming for The Evergreen State College
        woods with the removal of a major barrier to their upriver migration.</p>
       <p>With assistance from partners including The Evergreen State College, Washington State
        Salmon Recovery Funding Board, The Wild Fish Conservancy, People For Puget Sound, the
        Estuary and Salmon Restoration Program and The National Oceanic and Atmospheric
        Administration--Restore America&amp;#8217;s Estuaries program, an undersized 3-foot wide
        culvert at the mouth of campus&amp;#8217;s Snyder Creek will be removed and replaced by a
        14-foot wide box culvert. The cost of the culvert project totals $214,000, and is covered by
        contributions from The Evergreen State College, the Salmon Recovery Funding Board, and the
        Estuary and Salmon Restoration Program.</p>
       <p>The new fish passage will serve fish species such as coho salmon, chum salmon, cutthroat,
        and possibly steelhead. The bottom of the culvert will hold native stream bed. According to
        Jamie Glasgow of Wild Fish Conservancy, &amp;#8220;Fish won&amp;#8217;t even know they are
        in a culvert as they pass through it.&amp;#8221;</p>
       <p>Fish will once again gain access to almost one mile of spawning and rearing habitat. The
        work will also restore the natural processes of sediment, wood, and water transport -
        processes that researchers have found to be vital for fish and forest health. A work team,
        including contactor Horsley Timber and Construction, an engineer from Fisheries Consultant,
        Inc., an archeologist from the Squaxin Island Tribe, and fish biologists from Wild Fish
        Conservancy began construction on August 31 and construction will continue through September
        6.</p>
       <p>Bulkheads, barrier culverts, and other shoreline obstructions are threats to salmon
        habitat throughout the Puget Sound, and this project represents a potential model for
        actions around the Sound to restore fish access to critical breeding and rearing habitat.
        Restoring these habitats also has wider ecosystem benefits beyond the benefits for salmonids
        because it restores the ecological processes that shape diverse habitat structures. The
        shoreline of the College is one of the largest remaining stretches of undeveloped shoreline
        in south Puget Sound and thus restoration adjacent to that shoreline provides an opportunity
        for significant impact.</p>
       <p>Horsley Construction was contracted by Wild Fish Conservancy after a competitive bid
        process. This method of public works required an innovative agreement between Wild Fish
        Conservancy and the college. Jamie Glasgow is the project manager for Wild Fish
        Conservancy.</p>
       <p>Snyder Creek flows into Eld Inlet at Snyder Cove at the northwest corner of The Evergreen
        State College in Olympia.</p>

        <li>2700 Evergreen Parkway NW, Olympia, WA 98505</li>
       </ul>
       <p>We will recognize Evergreen&amp;#8217;s newly admitted veterans with a ceremonial
        presentation of the challenge coin medallion.</p>
       <p>Presented by the Veterans of Evergreen Transition and Success Team.</p>
       <h3>More on Mike Gregoire:</h3>
       <p>Mike Gregoire&amp;#8217;s daughters will tell you he is the calm, easy-going history buff
        who spent countless hours carting them from soccer practice to piano lessons, from ballet to
        church groups. He is the best backpacking companion, one patient gardener and the ultimate
        dessert chef. Around the Gregoire dinner table, he is the one who will goad others into a
        heated debate and then recline in his chair calmly taking in the scene.</p>
       <p>Mike Gregoire was born and reared in Everett, Washington. His mom taught elementary school
        in the Everett school district for 35 years. His father worked as a private contractor and
        union carpenter. A graduate of Everett High School 40 years ago, Mike remains connected to
        many of his high school friends &amp;#8212; he and his football buddies regularly get
        together to practice the art of poker.</p>
       <p>Mike graduated from the University of Washington with a history degree in 1968. While
        student teaching at a Seattle high school his final year, he considered pursuing a career as
        a teacher. During finals week of his senior year, Mike received his draft notice. While his
        classmates celebrated their graduation day, Mike began basic training at Fort Lewis.</p>
       <p>After completing field artillery Officer Candidate School at Fort Sill, Oklahoma, Mike was
        commissioned as a second lieutenant in the air defense artillery corps. He then served a
        tour of duty as a platoon leader and convoy commander with the &amp;#8220;Delta
        Express&amp;#8221; in the Mekong Delta in Vietnam.</p>
       <p>Upon returning to Washington, Mike met Chris in September 1971, when they were both
        working for the Department of Social and Health Services. For their first date, Mike packed
        a picnic lunch and took Chris on a hike. After several hours of wandering, Chris realized
        they were lost, and started wondering if Mike&amp;#8217;s navigational skills had been left
        behind in the Delta. Three years later, however, Mike navigated Chris perfectly down the
        wedding aisle. He and Chris have two adult daughters: Courtney, an attorney, and Michelle, a
        recent college graduate. For the next 30 years, Mike worked as a health care investigator
        for the state of Washington. Retiring in July 2003 certainly hasn&amp;#8217;t slowed him
        down. He harvests a bumper crop of tomatoes, apples and pears; stays active in St.
        Michael&amp;#8217;s Parish; and fits in an occasional racquetball game.</p>
       <p>Mike&amp;#8217;s service in the military spurred a lifelong commitment to
        veterans&amp;#8217; affairs. He is particularly concerned about the effects of Agent Orange
        and veterans&amp;#8217; mental health issues. He is a lifetime member of the Veterans of
        Foreign Wars and a member of the American Legion and the Vietnam Veterans of America. As
        Washington&amp;#8217;s First Gentleman, or &amp;#8220;First Mike&amp;#8221; as he prefers to
        be called, he tours the state to meet with veterans and active military personnel. He
        lobbies the Governor over dinner on veterans&amp;#8217; issues and is committed to making
        sure our state lives up to its commitments to our servicemen and servicewomen.</p>
       <p>Mike Gregoire is an advocate for children&amp;#8217;s and family literacy. As a parent,
        Mike recognizes the importance of reading with children. He also knows that strong reading
        skills prepare young people for academic success and a lifelong love of learning. Mike is
        traveling across the state to visit schools and libraries. He reads to elementary school
        students and thanks teachers, principals and librarians for their good work. He has visited
        at least one elementary school in each of the state&amp;#8217;s 39 counties.</p>

       <h3>Western Region Faculty Engagement Survey Findings Announced<br/>
       </h3>
       <p>
        <strong>Evergreen Noted Among Colleges that Demonstrate High Levels of Commitment to Public
         Service as an Academic Aim and Educational Approach</strong>
       </p>
       <p>Olympia, WA -- Washington Campus Compact and the Western Region Campus Compact Consortium
        released data today on a faculty engagement survey of the Western Region.</p>
       <p>The first of its kind to collect faculty engagement data on <em>service learning</em> and
         <em>community-based research</em> across a multi-state region, the survey included more
        than 2,500 faculty members at 47 campuses across California, Colorado, Hawaii, Oregon, Utah,
        and Washington.</p>
       <h3>So What is Service Learning?</h3>
       <p><em>Service-learning</em> is education based in inclusive community assistance, activism
        and outreach. Students engaged in service learning activities attain academic goals via
        service to their community. Also examined in the survey, <em>community-based research</em>
        involves collaboration between researchers and community members in the design and
        implementation of research projects aimed at meeting community-identified needs.</p>
       <p>The Evergreen State College was notable for its use of service learning in teaching of
        social sciences, cross-cultural and international relations, education and the humanities.
        In each of these areas, Evergreen reported higher use of service learning than Western
        Region averages.</p>
       <p>Service learning at Evergreen was also characterized by a focus on learning that promotes
        socially beneficial aims. The most reported issues addressed by service learning efforts
        according to responders at Evergreen included cultural awareness, education and literacy,
        environmental issues, health care, homelessness, immigration and refugee assistance,
        low-income assistance, parks and gardens, visual and performing arts, and vulnerable
        youth.</p>
       <p>Researchers working on the project collected common data across the Western Region in
        order to identify current faculty service-learning and community-based research practices;
        possible strategies to motivate and support new faculty to do service-learning and
        community-based research; best practices by which to support faculty who already incorporate
        service-learning and community based research into their work; and the potential impacts of
        service-learning and community-based research on faculty, students, campuses, and
        communities.</p>
       <p>Established in 1992 and hosted at Western Washington University, Washington Campus Compact
        and its membership of 35 two- and four-year colleges and universities work to promote
        service learning as a means to provide meaningful experiences for students to become active,
        engaged leaders in their communities, further the civic and public purposes of higher
        education and strengthen communities. Washington Campus Compact is an affiliate state office
        of Campus Compact, a national organization comprised of more than 1,100 higher education
        institutions committed to the civic and public purposes of higher education</p>
       <p>Participating Campus Compacts will be able to use data in the survey to shape strategic
        directions and programming as well as learn more about how faculty members are involved in
        service-learning and community-based research; how to support faculty; and how
        service-learning impacts faculty, students, and community members. &amp;#8220;A research
        effort of this kind hasn&amp;#8217;t been done in our region,&amp;#8221; said Jennifer Dorr,
        executive director of Washington Campus Compact. &amp;#8220;This research points to the
        significant impacts that service-learning has on faculty, students, and
        communities.&amp;#8221;</p>
       <p>The research project was funded by Learn and Serve America Higher Education, a program of
        the Corporation for National and Community Service and directed by Washington Campus
        Compact.</p>

       <h4>The American Chemical Society Puget Sound Section Presents</h4>
       <h4>"The Role of Chemistry in the Development of Regional Styles of Beer and Ale" at The
        Evergreen State College</h4>
       <h3>Who</h3>
       <p>Dr. Mark Thomson of Ferris State University</p>
       <h3>What</h3>
       <p>Learn about how beer is made and the role that chemistry or microbiology plays in the
        process? We will briefly discuss the basic process of beer fermentation from a small-scale
        perspective. From malting the barley and mashing the malt, through fermentation and
        conditioning, to packaging the finished product, particular attention will be paid to the
        role of chemistry in the development of regional beer styles and traditions. Connections
        will be made between steps in the process and results in the final product including color,
        bitterness, aroma, body, and taste. Many of these connections will illustrate the subtle,
        but important role that small chemical details can play. For those interested, information
        will be available on judging standards and style guidelines for local and national Homebrew
        Competitions provided by the BJCP or Beer Judge Certification Program.</p>

     <title>Endangered Oregon spotted frogs returned to native habitat at Fort Lewis</title>

      endangered Oregon spotted frogs were released into the wild after spending the first nine
      months of their lives in a captive-rearing program. </summary>

       <p>OLYMPIA &amp;#8211; In an ongoing effort to recover native Puget Sound wetland species,
        some 500 endangered Oregon spotted frogs were released into the wild after spending the
        first nine months of their lives in a captive-rearing program.</p>
       <p>Biologists from the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife (WDFW), Woodland Park Zoo,
        Oregon Zoo, and the U.S. Army released the frogs this fall into Dailman Lake on the Fort
        Lewis Military Reservation in Pierce County in a collaborative effort to return the
        endangered frog to a portion of its historic habitat.</p>
       <p>The frogs, most weighing less than two ounces, were collected as fertilized eggs last
        spring, and &amp;#8220;head-started&amp;#8221; in captivity at the zoos and the Cedar Creek
        Corrections Center near Olympia to improve their chance of survival once they return to the
        wild.</p>
       <p>The frog release is the second in a five-year collaborative effort led by WDFW to
        establish a self-sustaining population on the Fort Lewis site. Approximately 600 frogs
        reared at Northwest Trek Wildlife Park and Oregon Zoo were released at the same location
        last year.</p>
       <p>This year, two Cedar Creek inmates raised a number of the young frogs through the
        Sustainable Prisons Project, a partnership between The Evergreen State College and the
        Washington State Department of Corrections that allows incarcerated men and women to
        participate in science-based conservation projects.</p>
       <p>The Dailman Lake area was chosen for the reintroduction because it contains diverse
        wetlands that can sustain a frog population and is largely protected from human activity,
        said Jim Lynch, Fort Lewis wildlife biologist.</p>
       <p>All of the frogs released last year appear to have survived predators.</p>
       <p>&amp;#8220;We were encouraged with these findings, but direct observation was limited
        because the frogs are very effective at concealing themselves,&amp;#8221; Lynch said.</p>
       <p>This year, to improve data collection, about a quarter of the released frogs will be
        equipped with a tiny microchip that can be scanned by a wand reader.</p>
       <p>In 2010, biologists will begin looking for egg masses to determine if the frogs have
        established breeding populations.</p>
       <p>The Oregon spotted frog historically ranged from southwestern British Columbia to
        northeastern California, but is now known only in Klicikitat and Thurston counties in
        Washington. Loss of habitat, predation by non-native species such as the American bullfrog
        and disease have decimated its numbers, which prompted its listing as a Washington state
        endangered species in 1997.</p>
       <p>&amp;#8220;Frogs worldwide are known as sentinel species that play an important role in
        ecosystems,&amp;#8221; said Marc Hayes, senior research scientist and project lead for WDFW.
        &amp;#8220;When they disappear from their habitat, these ecosystems can be
        disrupted.&amp;#8221;</p>
       <p>The U.S. Department of the Interior recently awarded WDFW a grant to coordinate range-wide
        recovery projects for the Oregon spotted frog and associated species. A portion of the grant
        supports the Fort Lewis project.</p>
       <p>&amp;#8220;Restoring native wetland species such as the Oregon spotted frog and protecting
        habitat over broad areas are examples of an ecosystem approach that WDFW and partners are
        taking to help restore the state&amp;#8217;s biodiversity,&amp;#8221; said Phil Anderson,
        WDFW director.</p>
       <p>Partners involved in the reintroduction program at Fort Lewis include WDFW, Fort Lewis
        Military Reservation, Woodland Park Zoo, Oregon Zoo, Point Defiance Zoo &amp; Aquarium,
        Northwest Trek Wildlife Park, Washington State Department of Transportation, U.S. Fish and
        Wildlife Service, The Evergreen State College, Washington State Department of Corrections,
        Port Blakely Tree Farms, Washington Department of Natural Resources, NW Zoo &amp; Aquarium
        Alliance, U.S Geological Survey, Mountain View Conservation &amp; Breeding Centre and The
        Nature Conservancy.</p>

       <h3>About Amy Goodman</h3>
       <p>Amy Goodman is the host and executive producer of Democracy Now!, a national, daily,
        independent, award-winning news program airing on over 750 TV and radio stations in North
        America. Time Magazine named Democracy Now! its "Pick of the Podcasts," along with NBC's
        Meet the Press.</p>
       <p>Goodman is the first journalist to receive the <a
         href="http://www.rightlivelihood.org/goodman.html">Right Livelihood Award</a>, widely known
        as the &amp;#8216;Alternative Nobel Prize' for "developing an innovative model of truly
        independent grassroots political journalism that brings to millions of people the
        alternative voices that are often excluded by the mainstream media."</p>
       <p>Goodman is the co-author with her brother, journalist David Goodman, of three New York
        Times bestsellers. She writes a weekly column (also produced as an audio podcast) syndicated
        by King Features, for which she was recognized in 2007 with the James Aronson Award for
        Social Justice Reporting.</p>

       <h3>About the Book</h3>
       <p><em>Breaking the Sound Barrier</em>: By Amy Goodman, Edited by Denis Moynihan, Foreword by
        Bill Moyers</p>
       <p>Amy Goodman breaks through the corporate media's lies, sound-bites, and silence in this
        wide-ranging new collection of articles. In place of the usual suspects, the "experts" who,
        in Goodman's words,"know so little about so much, explain the world to us, and get it so
        wrong," this accessible, lively collection allows the voices the corporate media exclude and
        ignore to be heard loud and clear.</p>

       <p><strong>(Olympia, Wash.)</strong> Students at The Evergreen State College reported higher
        than average engagement on all benchmark measures of the 2009 National Survey of Student
        Engagement (NSSE), which included academic challenge, active and collaborative learning,
        student-faculty interaction, enriching educational experiences, and a supportive campus
        environment.</p>
       <p>First year and Senior Evergreen students surveyed by NSSE scored the college strongly on
        the NSSE category Academic Challenge. They indicated that they spend more time preparing for
        class, engaging in coursework that requires synthesizing, analyzing, and making judgments
        about the value of information. They also reported reading more assigned texts and writing
        more short papers.</p>
       <p>Compared with other first-year and senior-class students who reported to NSSE, Evergreen
        respondents indicated that they more frequently gave class presentations and contributed to
        discussions in class. They also indicated that they more often worked with other students on
        projects during class and outside of class, as well as discussed ideas from reading and
        classes with others outside of class- all measures of Active and Collaborative Learning.
        First year students and seniors reported higher levels of Active and Collaborative learning
        on all measures in this category, as compared to peers, except on the measure of tutoring
        other students.</p>
       <p>In terms of Student-Faculty Interaction, Evergreen students more often discussed ideas
        from class with faculty members outside of class and received prompt feedback on academic
        performance. Evergreen first-year students and seniors were significantly more likely to
        have participated in several enriching educational experiences than students at other
        colleges and universities, engaging in more independent study and more frequent
        conversations with students who are different from themselves in terms of race, ethnicity,
        religion, political opinions, or values.</p>
       <p>While the report presented predominately favorable news for Evergreen, Laura Coghlan,
        Director of Institutional Research notes that student engagement is a continuous process and
        work remains. According to Coghlan, the report noted that Evergreen first year students are
        less likely to feel the campus environment helps them cope with their non-academic
        responsibilities or provides the support they need to thrive socially. Also, Evergreen
        seniors see quality of relationships as something in need of improvement. "While the good
        news reinforces that we are meeting our intention of engaging students in an innovative and
        challenging learning environment," says Coghlan, "we are also reflecting on the implications
        of lower than average areas and striving to improve them."&amp;#160;</p>
       <p>Evergreen participates in the National Survey of Student Engagement as part of its ongoing
        institutional assessment plan. Six hundred and sixteen four-year U.S. colleges and
        universities participated in the survey. The National Survey of Student Engagement works on
        the premise of providing a more complex view of quality, with recognition that holistic
        assessments of many disaggregated factors provide for more accurate and useful comparisons
        on issues of concern for student learning than traditional ranking systems.</p>
       <p>While Evergreen also does well in traditional regional and national rankings, Evergreen's
        regular participation in the National Survey of Student Engagement provides additional
        national context and multi-year trend data through which to examine educational practices,
        emphases, and challenges. The survey had high participation at Evergreen with a response
        rate near 25 percent of all first year students and 22 percent of all seniors enrolled.</p>

       <p>(Olympia, Wash.) The Evergreen State College will receive a grant from Puget Sound Energy
        for $137,500 shortly after 10:00 a.m. at its regular Board of Trustees Meeting on January
        14, 2009.</p>
       <p>The grant will help defray the cost of variable speed drives that reduce the energy used
        by the two chillers that provide chilled water for air conditioning at Evergreen. The drive
        works by varying the speed at which the chiller runs depending on the amount of chilled
        water needed for the air conditioning load. The proposed chilled water system with variable
        speed drives has the potential for 27 percent or 226,442 kilowatt hours per year savings
        over the previous system.</p>
       <p>In 2008, PSE provided more than $18 million in conservation and energy efficiency grants
        to businesses and organizations in their service area. The Evergreen State College has been
        a partner in PSE&amp;#8217;s green energy program since October 2005.</p>

       <p>Ford Foundation Awards $145,000 to Evergreen&amp;#39;s Longhouse Education and Cultural
        Center</p>
       <p>Funds to Support Native Arts Activities</p>
       <p>The Ford Foundation awarded $145,000 to the Longhouse Education and Cultural Center at The
        Evergreen State College to expand its work with Native artists. The funds will increase
        public understanding of Native art and culture in contemporary society, give artists
        opportunities to explore new media, and foster artistic and cultural exchange among
        tribes.</p>
       <p>&amp;quot;We are appreciative of this funding that will help us build upon the successes
        we have achieved with Native artists in creating and sharing their work,&amp;quot; says Tina
        Kuckkahn, director of the Longhouse.</p>
       <p>One of the unique services offered through the Longhouse is its function as a nexus for
        artistic and cultural exchanges across tribal cultures. With more than two-dozen tribes in
        the state, the Longhouse offers opportunities for indigenous artists to meet on common
        ground to link with and learn from each other. The grant now makes it possible to access
        formats at Evergreen-kilns, printmaking facilities, digital photography equipment-not
        available in tribal communities.</p>
       <p>The grant will help expand the artist-in-residence program, which brings established
        Native American artists to tribal reservation sites and to the Evergreen campus to work with
        local Native artists in traditional and contemporary visual and performance arts.
        Participants will range in age from preschooler through adult, and include Pacific Northwest
        tribes as well as urban Indian peoples. These residencies will give prominence to the Coast
        and Puget Salish art and culture, according to Kuckkahn.</p>
       <p>In the past, the Longhouse has offered residencies in various media, including carving and
        weaving, that have drawn major Native artists. The grant will cover additional residencies
        to boost the preservation of almost-lost art forms as apprentices take the knowledge they
        gain from master artists back to their tribal communities. Kuckkahn says that plans are to
        invite noted artists clay-mask artists Lillian Pitt and Jim Jackson, printmakers Susan Point
        and Melanie Yazzie, digital artist Larry McNeil and storyteller Gerald
        &amp;quot;Bruce&amp;quot; Miller to campus to share their talents. Public presentations and
        exhibitions of all residences will be showcased both at the Longhouse and the Squaxin Island
        tribe&amp;#39;s museum.</p>
       <p>The grant will finance the expansion of a database that serves as a registry of Native
        American artists. Currently this resource connects individual artists with galleries,
        patrons and opportunities for personal, professional and artistic development. Improvements
        would make the site interactive for the artists so they would be able to communicate with
        each other despite geographic and distance limitations. Kuckkahn envisions artists
        communicating about issues of access to natural resources, intellectual property, tax
        workshops, and bulletins of upcoming shows. She further explains that artists would be able
        to download information about assembling portfolios, designing Web sites, and guidelines for
        joining the State Art Commission&amp;#39;s resource bank.</p>
       <p>&amp;quot;The grant opens doors of possibility that we have only dreamed of,&amp;quot;
        Kuckkahn says. &amp;quot;In the past several years, we&amp;#39;ve been able to help artists
        both develop and sell their work. Now we&amp;#39;ll help them mentor each other as they keep
        their tribal traditions, culture and art alive for generations to come.&amp;quot;</p>
       <p>Evergreen employs 28 Native American faculty and staff, about 4 percent of the total
        workforce. With a Native student population of 4.6 percent, the college has more than twice
        the ratio of Native students compared to Washington&amp;#39;s other public four-year
        colleges and universities. Evergreen is identified by The Winds of Change Magazine&amp;#39;s
        &amp;quot;Annual Guide for American Indians&amp;quot; as one of 200 colleges and
        universities in the country where Native students succeed academically and have meaningful
        support as college students.</p>

       <p>Intel Grant Targets Math and Science Instruction</p>
       <p>$66,000 Awarded to Evergreen Center for Educational Improvement</p>
       <p>The Intel Foundation awarded $66,000 to the Evergreen Center for Educational Improvement
        to support professional development for principals and secondary school math and science
        teachers. The Evergreen Center, one of six public service centers at The Evergreen State
        College, serves as the facilitator for a consortium of nine school districts in Thurston and
        Pierce counties: Bethel, Clover Park, Franklin-Pierce, North Thurston, Olympia, Puyallup,
        Steilacoom, Tacoma and Yelm.</p>
       <p>The Intel grant will fund symposia designed to give principals a deeper understanding of
        science and math curricula and teaching strategies so they can effectively support classroom
        instruction. A series of workshops will assist 25 secondary school math and science teachers
        with assessment and writing techniques to complement their programs.</p>
       <p>This is the fourth grant that the Evergreen Center has received from Intel on behalf of
        the consortium school districts. &amp;quot;We are very grateful for Intel&amp;#39;s
        continued support of our work,&amp;quot; says Maureen Canny, project director. She says that
        another component of the grant will allow school district leadership teams to participate in
        regional and national conferences.</p>
       <p>Workshops and symposia are scheduled to begin in the spring and run through the 2004-05
        academic year.</p>

        ways- policymakers and politicians among them. The training I get with this program will
        make it easier for me to magnify the work I do in my specific area of research to reach new
        audiences.&amp;quot;</p>
       <p>Nadkarni teaches in Evergreen&amp;#39;s popular environmental studies program. Her
        research is focused on the ecology of tropical and temperate forest canopies, particularly
        the role that canopy-dwelling plants play in forests at the ecosystem level. She carries out
        field research in Washington state and in Monteverde, Costa Rica, with the support of the
        National Science Foundation and the National Geographic Society. She has published two books
        and more than 70 articles in scientific journals on forest canopy ecology and forest
        ecosystem ecology. Nadkarni has presented a number of endowed lectures at academic
        institutions around the country.</p>
       <p>In 1994, she co-founded and is president of the International Canopy Network, a
        not-for-profit organization that fosters communication among researchers, educators and
        conservationists concerned with forest canopies. Nadkarni conducts public outreach to the
        public, children and policymakers on forest canopies and forest conservation. She has
        appeared in a number of television documentaries, and was most recently featured as a canopy
        scientist in the National Geographic television special &amp;quot;Heroes of the High
        Frontier&amp;quot; on tropical forest canopies, which won the Emmy Award for Best
        Documentary Film of 2001. Also in 2001, Nadkarni received a Guggenheim Fellowship to pursue
        her interests in communication of forest canopy research results to non-scientists with
        collaborations of artists, musicians, physicians, sports figures and religious leaders. She
        was a primary organizer of last year&amp;#39;s highly acclaimed Art and Science Chautauqua
        on Evergreen&amp;#39;s Olympia campus, a week-long event that brought together scientists,
        artists, musicians and others to explore and celebrate the role of trees in modern
        society.</p>
       <p>Nadkarni received her undergraduate degree in biology from Brown University and doctorate
        in forest ecology from the University of Washington.</p>
       <p>Aldo Leopold Leadership Fellowships provide scientists with intensive communications and
        leadership training to enhance their ability to communicate effectively with non-scientific
        audiences. The fellows are selected annually through a competitive application process and
        have outstanding scientific qualifications, demonstrated leadership ability and a strong
        interest in communicating science beyond traditional academic audiences.</p>
       <p>The 2004 fellows represent a broad range of environmental science disciplines, including
        environmental engineering, wildlife veterinary medicine, tropical forestry, marine ecology
        and environmental economics.</p>
       <p>The Aldo Leopold Leadership Program was launched in 1998 with the goal of improving the
        flow of accurate, credible scientific information to policymakers, the media and the public
        by training outstanding academic environmental scientists to be better communicators of
        complex scientific information. The program is named for Aldo Leopold, a renowned
        environmental scientist who communicated his scientific knowledge simply and eloquently. His
        writings, including his 1949 book, &amp;quot;A Sand County Almanac,&amp;quot; are credited
        with infusing the emerging conservation movement with good science and a stewardship
        ethic.</p>

      <body><p>Evergreen Instructors Awarded $14,250 for Computer Science Studies</p> Funds to Cover
       Entrepreneurial Activities for Software Course <p>Dr. Judith Cushing and Dr. Sherri Shulman,
        faculty members in computer sciences at The Evergreen State College, have been awarded
        $14,250 by the Lemelson Foundation for their proposal &amp;quot;Team Building and
        Entrepreneurship Among Computer Science Students.&amp;quot; The grant will enhance the
        ability of 25 students enrolled winter and spring quarters in the Evergreen program Student
        Originated Software to develop and market software. It also will allow the instructors to
        build curriculum in team skills, develop an effective evaluation strategy and to share
        materials with other computer science programs throughout the country.</p>
       <p>The grant will also help Cushing and Shulman to collaborate with colleagues at the
        Evergreen Tacoma campus to explore strategies for recruiting women and members of
        underrepresented groups to computing, which remains a largely white male profession.</p>
       <p>&amp;quot;With a successful 20-year track record in software engineering education, we
        find that projects work best when students have an entrepreneurial spirit and excellent team
        skills,&amp;quot; Cushing says. &amp;quot;We hear from employers that Evergreen students
        have significant management and marketing potential as well as technical expertise and
        innovative spirit.&amp;quot;</p>
       <p>Cushing and Shulman&amp;#39;s program Student Originated Software combines upper-division
        computer science learning with in-depth practical experiences in software engineering,
        including the planning, management, design, implementation and maintenance of software
        projects.</p>
       <p>Students work in groups of two to four on a project for an identified real-world customer,
        or in pursuit of a marketable, intellectually or socially worthwhile idea. During winter
        quarter, students are working on software system design, doing market research and creating
        business plans. In the next quarter, they will complete their projects and demonstrate them
        on campus at a Software Fair.</p>
       <p>Six projects are currently under development. One is eze-com, which would give small and
        computer-strapped businesses easy-to-install and -use software for commercial sites, making
        them more competitive. A second is Heart of Gold, an open source engine management system
        that lets users plug into a laptop and run automobile engine diagnostics. The software
        analyzes the problem, provides a short list of possible diagnoses-and then links to the same
        Internet-based repair manuals that the car shops use. A third software program-Legal
        XML-would make legal documents more understandable to the layperson by providing both a way
        to markup &amp;quot;legalese&amp;quot; into plain English, making it easier to read, and a
        navigation system that pinpoints sections of a document that match the reader&amp;#39;s need
        or interest.</p>
       <p>Cushing earned a bachelor of arts in math and philosophy from the College of William and
        Mary; master&amp;#39;s in logic and philosophy of science from Brown University; and a
        doctorate in computer science from the OGI School of Science and Technology at Oregon Health
        and Science Institute.</p>
       <p>Shulman has a bachelor of arts in natural science from Shimer College; master of science
        degree in computer science from Illinois Institute of Technology; and a doctorate in
        computer science from the OGI School of Science and Technology at Oregon Health and Science
        Institute.</p>
       <p>The award was made through the National Collegiate Inventors and Innovators Alliance,
        which facilitates grant requests from E-Team programs at colleges around the country. An
        E-Team is a group of students who train to go into business and develop products in the
        future while at school. The E stands for both excellence and entrepreneurship.</p>

       <p>Evergreen Class to Show Student-Produced Videos<br/> Positive Psychology Students Invite
        Public to Viewing</p>
       <p>Wed., March 10, 2004<br/> Longhouse Education and Cultural Center<br/> 6:30-9 p.m.<br/> 7
        p.m., talk by Dr. Jonathon Brown<br/> Free and open to the public. Campus parking $1.25</p>
       <p>The emerging topic of positive psychology is the focus of an evening of information at The
        Evergreen State College. Students in the Positive Psychology program invite members of the
        community to view videos they have created and to hear remarks by noted psychologist
        Jonathon Brown, Ph.D. The event takes place on Wednesday, March 10 in the college&amp;#39;s
        Longhouse from 6:30 to 9 p.m., and is free and open to the public. Campus parking is
        $1.25.</p>
       <p>&amp;quot;Positive experience, character and institutions have too often been left out of
        the scope of psychology,&amp;quot; says Evergreen instructor Mark Hurst, a clinical
        psychologist with a private practice in Olympia. &amp;quot;While dysfunction and mental
        illness are still a focus of much of psychology, there is a important movement among some in
        the field to address the &amp;#39;social science&amp;#39; of happiness.&amp;quot;
        Hurst&amp;#39;s program is designed to assist students in understanding and building the
        elements of &amp;quot;positivity&amp;quot; in their own lives. Those elements include
        assessing the signature strengths such as courage, curiosity, kindness, forgiveness, empathy
        and creativity.</p>
       <p>Drawing from the works of psychologists such as Martin Seligman, Julie Norem and C.R.
        Snyder, Hurst interlaces the academic with the practical by promoting real-world positive
        experiences. &amp;quot;Students are engaging in &amp;#39;gratitude visits,&amp;#39;
        forgiveness exercises, &amp;#39;full life&amp;#39; planning, philanthropic activities and
        building &amp;#39;resilience toolboxes&amp;#39; for the stressors they confront in
        life,&amp;quot; Hurst says. &amp;quot;Just six weeks into the program, they were already
        writing about the remarkable changes they had experienced in their day-to-day
        lives.&amp;quot;</p>
       <p>Student groups will show videos that exemplify aspects of core virtues and signature
        strengths, as well as overall life satisfaction and happiness.</p>
       <p>Keynote speaker Jonathon D. Brown is an associate professor of psychology at the
        University of Washington.&amp;#160;He has published two books and numerous articles, and
        received a Presidential Young Investigator Award from the National Science
        Foundation.&amp;#160;His 1988 paper with Shelley Taylor, &amp;quot;Illusion and Well-Being:
        A Social Psychological Perspective on Mental Health&amp;quot; was one of the most
        influential articles in the field of psychology during the 1990s, and his more recent text,
        &amp;quot;The Self,&amp;quot; presents a comprehensive&amp;#160;yet accessible review of the
        nature of self-concept, self-esteem, and self-regulation of behavior. &amp;#160;</p>

       <p>Open to the public</p>
       <p>A fun evening of music, dance and poetry is slated for Saturday, March 6 at The Evergreen
        State College&amp;#39;s Daniel J. Evans Library in the first floor lobby.
        &amp;quot;Devotional Music and Poetry From the Middle East&amp;quot; offers lively
        entertainment suitable for all members of the family. Tickets are $5 for Evergreen students
        and $7 general admission and are available at the Evergreen Bookstore, and downtown at

       <p>Tuesday, June 1, 2004<br/> The Evergreen State College<br/> Daniel J. Evans Library
        mezzanine<br/> 1-4 p.m.<br/> Free and open to the public<br/>
        <br/> Projects in ecology, automotive maintenance, computer chip testing, legal systems,
        e-commerce, and graphics support for computer games are those to be showcased at the
        Computer Science Software Fair. The event takes place at The Evergreen State College on
        Tuesday, June 1 at the Daniel J. Evans Library mezzanine. The event is free and open to the
        public. Campus parking is $1.25.<br/>
        <br/> Twenty-five computer science students at Evergreen organize the software fair to
        demonstrate their yearlong software engineering projects, which spring from the Student
        Originated Software program. This course combines upper-division computer science learning
        with in-depth practical experiences in software engineering, including the planning,
        management, design, implementation and maintenance of software.<br/>
        <br/> Students have worked in small groups for an identified real-world customer, or in
        pursuit of an intellectually or socially worthwhile idea. During fall and winter quarters,
        they completed software system design and learned the technologies needed to implement their
        systems. In the spring quarter, they completed the programming of the projects that they
        will demonstrate at the Software Fair.<br/>
        <br/> Seven projects will be displayed and demonstrated. Among them are software for a
        &amp;quot;roll your own e-commerce site;&amp;quot; an open source software for automobile
        engine diagnostics; an open source 3D model rendering framework for game development; and an
        operating system support for running programs on multiple UNIX computers.<br/>
        <br/> Student Originated Software faculty members Judith Bayard Cushing and Sheri Shulman,
        and Evergreen staff members Isaac Overcast, Michael Finch and Anne Fiala mentored the
        students&amp;#39; work. Financial support comes from community sponsors and grants from the
        National Collegiate Inventors&amp;#39; and Innovators&amp;#39; Alliance, the National
        Science Foundation and Evergreen&amp;#39;s PLATO Royalty Fund.<br/>

        <br/> The class of 2004 is the largest ever to graduate from The Evergreen State College,
        with 1,256 undergraduates and 104 graduates expected to pick up their degrees. The previous
        record was set in 2000, when the college graduated a total of 1,324 students. Last year,
        1,232 students graduated.<br/>
        <br/> Commencement is scheduled for Friday, June 11 on Red Square at the Olympia campus,
        starting at 1 p.m., rain or shine. Environmental activist and educator Dr. Vandana Shiva is
        the keynote speaker at the event, which is free and open to the public.<br/>
        <br/> Evergreen will award 1,037 bachelor of arts, 159 bachelor of science, 60 bachelor of
        arts and science combined, 38 master of teaching, 32 master of environmental studies and 34
        master of public administration degrees.<br/>
        <br/> The class of 2004 selected Shiva as graduation speaker. She is a physicist, ecologist,
        activist, editor and author who has long championed the issue of sustainability. She
        established Navdanya, a movement for biodiversity conservation and farmers&amp;#39; rights,
        in her home country of India and directs the Research Foundation for Science, Technology and
        Natural Resource Policy. Shiva&amp;#39;s most recent books are &amp;quot;Biopiracy: The
        Plunder of Nature and Knowledge&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Stolen Harvest: The Hijacking of the
        Global Food Supply.&amp;quot;<br/>
        <br/> Graduation addresses will be given by Dr. Oscar Soule, Evergreen faculty member who
        will be awarded the rank of emeritus by the college&amp;#39;s board of trustees later this
        spring; Colleen F. Cawston, a candidate for a master of public administration degree; and
        Justus Stewart, who will receive a bachelor&amp;#39;s degree.<br/>

       <p>Dr. Don Bantz Takes Chief Academic Position at College<br/>
        <br/> Evergreen President Thomas L. &amp;quot;Les&amp;quot; Purce announces that Dr. Don
        Bantz has accepted the position of vice president for academic affairs and provost. Bantz
        has been filling the college&amp;#39;s chief academic position on an interim basis for the
        past year. He previously served for three years as an academic dean for budget and as a
        member of the faculty for 17 years.<br/>
        <br/> &amp;quot;It was gratifying to have so many outstanding candidates apply,&amp;quot;
        Purce said of the competitive process that attracted applicants from across the country. In
        selecting him from the other two finalists, Purce said that Bantz &amp;quot; brings to the
        position a passion and deep understanding of all that makes teaching and learning at
        Evergreen extraordinary. He has been particularly effective in using his deep knowledge of
        Evergreen to engage in complex, long-standing issues that are important to our community.&amp;quot;<br/>
        <br/> &amp;quot;Evergreen&amp;#39;s distinctive philosophy fosters intense intellectual and
        personal growth,&amp;quot; Bantz said. &amp;quot;I feel privileged to serve as provost in
        this very special learning community. The students, faculty and staff are extraordinary.&amp;quot;<br/>
        <br/> Bantz began his career at Evergreen in 1988 in the Master of Public Administration
        program, where he taught political and economic context of public administration, research
        methods, understanding public organizations and a number of other offerings. An accomplished
        public administrator, Bantz&amp;#39;s experience includes positions in Snohomish County,
        where he was the administrator of the Community Services Division, and Alaska, where he was
        executive director of several health-care programs. He has extensive experience working with
        diverse populations, including more than 50 Indian tribes throughout Washington, California
        and Alaska.<br/>
        <br/> Bantz earned a bachelor&amp;#39;s degree in management and marketing from Fullerton
        State University, and a master&amp;#39;s and doctoral degree in public administration from
        the University of Southern California.<br/>

        Chaloupka on Wed., May 26, from 7:30-9:30 p.m. in Lecture Hall I on the Olympia campus.<br/>
        <br/> Modern science is an awesome and exciting adventure. We seem to be able to navigate
        nature through the Big Bang and the rapidly unfolding genome project to quantum mechanics.
        But as we do, the gap increases between this cumulative progress in science and technology
        and our ability to thoughtfully use new technological tools. Some assert that we are in the
        process of acquiring powers that we should not have, and that catastrophic consequences
        await us.<br/>
        <br/> Chaloupka&amp;#39;s lecture will examine this dilemma with exuberance and humility
        through the use of music.<br/>

        the public<br/> Campus parking $1.25<br/>
        <br/> Abstract: This lecture provides an introduction to natural language semantics.
        Semantics is a branch of theoretical linguistics. To analyze any natural language (e.g.,
        English), we must have a clear understanding of its structure at three different levels:
        phonology , syntax , and semantics . Phonology has to do with a language&amp;#39;s sound
        structure; syntax studies the ways in which words are put together to form grammatical
        sentences; semantics deals with the interpretation of grammatical sentences. The primary
        task of the semanticist is to explain why it is possible to convey our thoughts by means of
        the words and the syntactic structure we actually use for this purpose. We must also pay
        attention to the fact that different languages often employ vastly different constructions
        to encode the same (type of) information. Though it is difficult, we strive to construct a
        semantic theory (as part of a linguistic theory) that accounts for diverse semantic
        phenomena across languages.<br/>
        <br/> Biography: Toshiyuki Ogihara is Associate Professor of Linguistics at the University
        of Washington. He obtained his M.A. in 1983 from Sophia University (Tokyo, Japan) and his
        Ph.D in 1989 from the University of Texas at Austin. He specializes in the formal semantics
        of natural language and is also interested in the syntax-semantics interface and Japanese
        linguistics. Before he came to Seattle, he held positions at the institute for natural
        language processing at the University of Stuttgart, Germany (1988-90) and at Tokyo Gakugei

       <p>Keith Jackson<br/> Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory<br/> Tuesday, May 11, 1-2:30, LH
        1<br/> PLATO Royalty Lecture Series (1)<br/> Free and open to the public<br/>
        <br/> Abstract: As the process of science is transformed over the next five to 10 years by
        the increase in computer capabilities, scientists will be faced with a flood of data. In
        order to manage this avalanche of data, it is becoming increasingly clear that techniques
        from the grid, A.I. and semantic Web communities will be essential to the scientific
        process. This talk will examine the need for semantic content in the scientific process, and
        look at how semantic information can be used to accelerate the scientific process.<br/>
        <br/> Biography: Keith Jackson is currently a scientist at the Lawrence Berkeley National
        Laboratory, where he is a member of the Secure Grid Technology Group. He has been involved
        in developing a PKI based authorization system (Akenti), and a secure advanced reservation
        system (STARS). He is currently a principal investigator on three projects focused on
        developing component-based interfaces to &amp;quot;grid&amp;quot; services, and prototyping
        large-scale computational and data &amp;quot;grids.&amp;quot; His interests include
        distributed access control, distributed system security, advanced reservations, network
        quality of service, component based middleware, and PKI-based applications.<br/>
        <br/> Prior to joining LBNL, Jackson worked at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory.
        While there, he was responsible for providing secure remote access to a NMR facility. He
        also contributed to the development of a remote collaboration tool (CORE2000), and an
        electronic notebook. He received a B.S. from The Evergreen State College in 2000.<br/>

       <p>Friday, June 11, 2004<br/> Red Square, rain or shine<br/> 1-4:30 p.m. (estimated ending
        time)<br/> Free and open to the public<br/>
        <br/> The graduating class of The Evergreen State College has chosen Dr. Vandana Shiva as
        the speaker for the college&amp;#39;s 33 rd Commencement. The ceremony and following
        celebration are scheduled for Friday, June 11, 2004, on Red Square on the Olympia campus.
        The event begins at 1 p.m., rain or shine, with Dr. Shiva&amp;#39;s remarks expected to
        begin at 1:30 p.m. Commencement is free and open to the public. Campus parking is complimentary.<br/>
        <br/> Shiva is a physicist, ecologist, editor and author internationally renowned for her
        activism. Born in the Dehradun valley in India to a father who worked to conserve forests
        and a farmer mother, Shiva aspired since childhood to be a scientist. She completed studies
        in physics, earning a doctorate in quantum theory at the University of Western Ontario. She
        later conducted interdisciplinary research in science, technology and environmental policy
        at the Indian Institute of Science and the Indian Institute of Management in Bangalore, India.<br/>
        <br/> In 1982, Shiva founded the independent Research Foundation for Science, Technology and
        Ecology in Dehra Dun, India, whose focus is ecological and social issues. In 1991, she
        launched Navdanya, a national movement to protect the diversity and integrity of living
        resources and promote organic farming and fair trade. Shiva organized the international
        movement Diverse Women for Diversity in 1998 to support agricultural, patent and
        biotechnology initiatives. And this year, in collaboration with a British school, she
        started Bija Vidyapeeth, a college promoting sustainable living. She has lectured in a
        number of venues across the globe, including the University of Oslo; Schumacher College in

        <br/> Super Saturday, one of the biggest one-day festivals in the state, marks its 26 th
        anniversary on June 12 with a new emphasis on live music and entertainment for young and
        old. This year&amp;#39;s theme is &amp;quot;Festival for All Ages&amp;quot; and features

        traditions such as the Friends of the Evergreen Library used book sale, the Native Arts Fair
        in the Longhouse and the &amp;quot;Greener Oasis&amp;quot; for Evergreen alumni and friends.<br/>
        <br/> The Evergreen State College began hosting Super Saturday in 1978 as a way to thank the
        community for its support and to have some fun on graduation weekend. The popular event
        attracts 25,000 with its mix of entertainment, handmade arts and crafts, and international
        foods and flavors. Highlights this year include:<br/>
        <br/>

        <br/> When Evergreen Academic Adviser Joyce Stahmer tells a story, she uses her arms, legs,
        face and full vocal range to enchant her audience. Also a member of the Heartsparkle
        Players, Stahmer is a griotess-an African culture bearer, the royal keeper of history and
        folktales. The Friends of the Evergreen Library sponsors storytelling sessions and a free
        book distribution in the family activities area in the Library second floor lobby.<br/>
        <br/> The library book pre-sale takes place for members only from 10 to 11 a.m. Memberships

        coastal and plains-style drumming will perform throughout the day.<br/>
        <br/>
        <strong>Family Fun and Games</strong><br/>
        <br/> Children can play with Gak, water tables and other hands-on activities from juggling
        to chemistry in their special area on Red Square. Parents will appreciate a comfortable and
        quiet area for infants needing a respite from all the fun. Toddlers will have their own
        playroom to roam and interact with their peers.<br/>

        <br/> The Evergreen State College invites the public to the Willi Unsoeld Seminar with guest
        speaker Dr. Jerry Franklin on Friday, May 14 at the college&amp;#39;s Longhouse. The
        reception starts at 6 p.m. and is followed by Franklin&amp;#39;s presentation at 7 p.m. on
        &amp;quot;The Effects of Globalization of the Wood Products Industry on Forests and Forestry
        in North America: The Scarcely Glimpsed 600-Lb. Gorilla.&amp;quot; The evening is free and
        open to the public. Campus parking is $1.25.<br/>
        <br/> Franklin, dubbed the &amp;quot;guru of old growth,&amp;quot; is a professor with the
        College of Forest Resources at the University of Washington in Seattle. At the age of four
        his love for trees surfaced, and by nine, Franklin decided he would be a forester. He
        describes his mission as &amp;quot;cutting the best deal I can for forests and trees in a
        world dominated by humans.&amp;quot; Today he is regarded as one of the pioneers of forest
        ecosystem research.<br/>
        <br/> Franklin&amp;#39;s specialties are the structure and function of natural forest
        ecosystems, especially old-growth stands, and how forests recover from catastrophes. He
        teaches ecosystem analysis at UW and is the director of the Wind River Canopy Crane Research
        near the Columbia Gorge, which is operated by University of Washington, Pacific Northwest
        Research Station and Gifford Pinchot National Forest. Franklin serves as a consultant and
        land steward for sustainable forestry projects in southern Chile and Argentina.<br/>
        <br/> An award-winning scientist, Franklin has received the leadership in action award from
        the U.S. Chapter of the International Association for Landscape Ecology and an honorary
        degree of doctor of laws from Simon Fraser University in British Columbia. He has also
        published extensively on forest ecosystems and biodiversity. He earned bachelor and master
        of science degrees in forest management from Oregon State University, and a doctorate in
        botany and soils from Washington State University.<br/>
        <br/> The annual Willi Unsoeld Seminar honors the philosopher, theologian and mountaineer
        who was a founding member of the Evergreen faculty. Before Unsoeld died in an avalanche on
        Mount Rainier in March 1979, he inspired thousands of Evergreen<br/>

       <p>From blowing up balloons to setting up booths to taking charge of the poster design this
        year, Raquel has been a Super Saturday volunteer for nearly two decades.<br/>
        <br/> If actions speak louder than words, then Raquel Salinas wouldn&amp;#39;t need to talk
        for a very long time. Renowned for her strong community service ethic and commitment to
        students, Raquel has been a stalwart volunteer for many of the events and activities at Evergreen.<br/>
        <br/> Her story begins in 1987, when she entered the college as a freshman. She earned her
        bachelor&amp;#39;s and master in teaching degrees here in the &amp;#39;90s, and since then
        has put to use what she learned. For the past six years, Raquel has served as the
        coordinator of student support services for First Peoples&amp;#39; Advising Services, part
        of the Student Academic and Support Services family. Her job covers considerable territory,
        but it all boils down to serving students.<br/>
        <br/> In graduate school, she learned &amp;quot;how to be service-oriented in a way that is
        student-centered. I love to see students empowered and empower others, and I love their
        energy,&amp;quot; Raquel explains.<br/>
        <br/> Holly Colbert, director of First Peoples&amp;#39; Advising Services, says that Raquel
        has a &amp;quot;gift&amp;quot; of connecting with students and others, and that she
        &amp;quot;freely shares this gift with the college. She believes deeply in what Evergreen
        stands for and puts those beliefs into practice. Raquel is dedicated, compassionate and hard working.&amp;quot;<br/>
        <br/> Phyllis Lane, dean of Student Academic and Support Services, describes
        Raquel&amp;#39;s ability to take what may be just an &amp;quot;idea&amp;quot; and
        &amp;quot;transform it into a creative and artistic masterpiece.&amp;quot; Phyllis remarks
        that Raquel&amp;#39;s art is widely admired.<br/>
        <br/> Raquel is widely respected among her colleagues, too, for the countless hours she
        volunteers in activities from student organization meetings and events held at night
        (&amp;quot;I want to stay in touch with what they&amp;#39;re doing&amp;quot;) to a Hispanic
        women&amp;#39;s group to Super Saturday. &amp;quot;When help is needed, Raquel is happy to
        lend a very capable and creative hand,&amp;quot; says Vice President for Student Affairs Art
        Costantino. &amp;quot;She is one of our mainstays. I&amp;#39;m astounded at how often she
        pitches in, never drawing attention to herself. She&amp;#39;s all about getting the work done.&amp;quot;<br/>
        <br/> It&amp;#39;s that deep sense of service to community that propels Raquel.
        &amp;quot;Wherever I can help out, I try.&amp;quot; And Evergreen is a richer community for
        her efforts.<br/>

       <p>The William Randolf Hearst Foundation has given $100,000 to The Evergreen State College
        Foundation to continue its support of future Native American Teachers. It&amp;#39;s the
        second $100,000 grant from the Hearst Foundation to the college. The first in 1998, coupled
        with $50,000 match from the State of Washington, led to the creation of the Evergreen
        Foundation&amp;#39;s William Randolph Hearst Endowment for Future Native American Teachers.<br/>
        <br/> The endowment supports Native American students in the Master in Teaching program.
        Scholarships are awarded to second year MIT students with merit and financial need. The
        awards provide financial assistance to students who are entering their quarter of full-time
        student teaching.<br/>
        <br/> Hearst Foundation Vice President, Thomas Eastham, praised Evergreen in his award
        letter to the college. &amp;quot;The school&amp;#39;s record of deserving scholarship
        recipients, along with its high academic standards, were influential in board deliberations,
        as was your prudent stewardship of the fund.&amp;quot;<br/>
        <br/> The director of Evergreen&amp;#39;s MIT program, Scott Coleman, says the funds will be
        put to good use. &amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s the most generous scholarship we have for the MIT
        program. The increase to the endowment is great for the long term and will allow us to do
        more for more students.&amp;quot;<br/>
        <br/> The number of Native American MIT students has grown from four in 1999 when the
        endowment began to 22 students in 2002. Among the students supported by the endowment is
        Chauneen Goodell, an Evergreen MIT graduate in 2000.<br/>
        <br/> &amp;quot;There are hardly any native American teachers out there. I wanted to be
        there for Native American students, and everyone, so that the kids can learn a different
        version of what a teacher can be,&amp;quot; says Goodell. &amp;quot;I couldn&amp;#39;t have
        done it without either the loans or the grant.&amp;quot;<br/>
        <br/> Goodell currently teaches in the Aberdeen and Hoquiam school districts. Only 0.78% of
        Washington teachers are Native American.<br/>

       <p>It is my pleasure to announce the hiring of John Lauer as our new Director of Housing.
        John is currently serving as associate Director of Housing and Food Services at California
        State University, Chico, and he has over seventeen years of fulltime experience in residence
        hall work. John earned a B.S. in Education from the University of Wisconsin, Madison, and a
        Masters of Art and Social Science with emphasis on student development from California State
        University, Chico.<br/>
        <br/> John was the first choice of the search committee and the Housing staff. I thank the
        Housing Director Search Committee for their excellent work. The Search Committee Members
        were: Julie Slone and Bill Zaugg (Co-chairs), Jason Kilmer, Alexander Mar, Noel McHugh,
        Collin Orr, Monique Vallot, (staff), Lena Davidson, and Jaymie Lewis (students) and Eddy
        Brown (Faculty/Dean).<br/>
        <br/> I appreciate the work of Chuck McKinney, Fred Swift and Mark Lacina in providing
        leadership in Housing during this transition time. I commend the entire Housing staff for
        their dedication and for moving forward on important priorities during the past six months.<br/>
        <br/> John will begin work on August 2, 2004. Please join us in welcoming John and his wife
        Lilly to our little corner of the world.<br/>

       <p>&amp;quot;Rough Justice: Lynching and American Society, 1874-1947&amp;quot; is a book of
        firsts, a first book for historian Michael Pfeifer and, according to the author, the first
        national analysis of lynching and criminal justice. Pfeifer, a professor at The Evergreen
        State College in Olympia, WA, argues that lynching was not eradicated, but instead
        institutionalized. As states banned lynching, they replaced it with a revitalized death
        penalty. In Washington state, hanging is still an option.<br/>
        <br/> Pfeifer uncovered a lost and dark history in a century-old heap of coroner&amp;#39;s
        inquests, court reports, personal correspondence and news articles. In his travels and
        research, Pfeifer found evidence of lynchings unaccounted for since the 19th century, and in
        regions not typically associated with racial violence.<br/>
        <br/> &amp;quot;It was an amazing sensation to unwind the folder clasp on a
        coroner&amp;#39;s inquest that hadn&amp;#39;t been looked at since it was filed. I posted
        Web pages of all the lynchings that I documented in the seven states--Washington,
        California, Iowa, Wyoming, Louisiana, Wisconsin and New York--that I studied. Descendants,
        including grandchildren, of victims and perpetrators began emailing me. Through their
        correspondence, I learned details about the mob killings that never were published
        before,&amp;quot; Pfeifer said.<br/>
        <br/> In April, the Washington State Historical Society presented Pfeifer the Charles Gates
        Award for his article &amp;quot;Midnight Justice: Lynching and Law in the Pacific
        Northwest.&amp;quot; The award recognizes the best contribution to Pacific Northwest
        Quarterly in the previous year.<br/>
        <br/> &amp;quot;Rough Justice: Lynching and American Society, 1874-1947&amp;quot; was
        published last month by the University of Illinois Press and is available through Amazon.com
        and other online bookstores.<br/>

       <p>The major college guidebooks once again spotlight the affordability and strong academics
        of The Evergreen State College. The Princeton Review&amp;#39;s listing of &amp;quot;The Best
        357 Colleges&amp;quot; named Evergreen one of the &amp;quot;Best in the West,&amp;quot;
        specifically a &amp;quot;Best Value College.&amp;quot;<br/>
        <br/> &amp;quot;The Evergreen State College offers what most colleges cannot: private
        college amenities and class sizes at a public university price,&amp;quot; The Princeton
        Review said. The guide also listed Evergreen as #15 of 20 schools with a &amp;quot;Great
        College Radio Station.&amp;quot;<br/>
        <br/> U.S. News and World Report&amp;#39;s 2005 edition of &amp;quot;America&amp;#39;s Best
        Colleges&amp;quot; names Evergreen #15 of 20 for students graduating with the least amount
        of debt. The news magazine also listed Evergreen as one of 40 for best &amp;quot;first-year
        experience,&amp;quot; and one of 26 for best &amp;quot;learning communities.&amp;quot;<br/>
        <br/> &amp;quot;I would say that people are very hardworking and [Evergreen&amp;#39;s
        academic programs] force you to be very self-motivated. There aren&amp;#39;t many students
        who just go to school. There&amp;#39;s not really anyone who just goes to class. Everyone
        who is here wants to be here, and everyone who is here wants to learn,&amp;quot; a sophomore

       <p>Award-winning psychiatrist Paul Fleischman will grace the campus next week with an
        exclusive lecture and presentation, hosted by students. Fleischman connects the lives of
        outstanding figures such as the Buddha, Walt Whitman, and Gandhi with the ideal of inner
        peace and how real people cultivate peace in their everyday lives. He presents peacefulness
        as dynamic, selective, and egoless, shown through the constructive act of choosing different
        ways of life, such as having a smaller family or a more modest career.<br/>
        <br/> The summer course &amp;quot;Practices Put to Work: Transforming People and
        Institutions&amp;quot; is sponsoring Dr. Fleischman&amp;#39;s visit. Lead by faculty member
        Cheryl Simrell King, the class is centered around this question: How might we work, organize
        and ead/manage if we put the practices of ancient wisdom traditions to work? This course is
        an elective in the Masters of Public Administration (MPA) program at Evergreen.<br/>
        <br/> Paul R. Fleischman, M.D., is the author of The Buddha Taught Nonviolence, Not
        Pacifism, The Healing Spirit, Karma and Chaos, and Spiritual Aspects of Psychiatric
        Practice. He has contributed to Landscape, Nature, and The Yale Review. In 1993 he was
        awarded the Oskar Pfister Award by the American Psychiatric Association for his writing.<br/>

        <br/> Evergreen receives $877,000 from National Science Foundation<br/>
        <br/> Forest canopy research is a young and emerging science. Researchers had not discovered
        ways to compare the many types of forests from around the world &amp;#8211; until now.<br/>
        <br/> Judy Cushing and Nalini Nadkarni, faculty members at The Evergreen State College,
        think they&amp;#39;ve found a way. The National Science Foundation [NSF] has awarded them
        $877,000 to build a Web-based package of data and imaging software that would allow forest
        ecologists to connect and compare each other&amp;#39;s work.<br/>
        <br/> &amp;quot;Each researcher has measured one part of the forest, but no one has put the
        whole thing together. That is what Judy and I are trying to do &amp;#8211; to describe the
        whole from the parts &amp;#8211; by bringing in computer tools to help individual
        researchers synthesize what the forest structure really is,&amp;quot; said Nadkarni, a
        forest ecologist.<br/>
        <br/> The project&amp;#39;s central program, DataBank, will serve two purposes: (1) to
        synthesize datasets from different forest types, making the data comparable and searchable,
        and (2) to help scientists develop ways to organize, analyze and visualize data in ways that
        promote research synthesis. In addition to DataBank, &amp;quot;CanopyView&amp;quot; will
        help researchers &amp;quot;draw&amp;quot; forest structure and &amp;quot;Big Canopy
        Database&amp;quot; will be a research networking system.<br/>
        <br/> &amp;quot;While the work on this grant focuses primarily on the forest canopy, the
        findings and tools will be applicable more broadly within the field of ecology,&amp;quot;
        Cushing said. &amp;quot;This is the kind of project where interdisciplinary collaboration is
        required &amp;#8211; so Nalini and I are thankful to be at Evergreen which so encourages
        that ideal.&amp;quot;<br/>
        <br/> &amp;quot;The grant process is very competitive, it speaks very highly of Judy and
        Nalini to come out on top. They&amp;#39;re a very high-caliber team, a neat collaboration
        between computer science and forest ecology,&amp;quot; NSF program director Gerald Guala
        said. &amp;quot;The broader impacts of their project makes this a very good proposal to
        fund. The educational aspects are strong and the use of undergraduates is commendable.&amp;quot;<br/>
        <br/> Nadkarni and some forest ecologist colleagues already have a hypothesis to test with
        DataBank: changes in the structural diversity of forests, by humans or natural causes,
        affects biodiversity. DataBank puts years of collected data at Nadkarni&amp;#39;s
        fingertips, saving her the task of finding funding for a new batch of research in a rough economy.<br/>
        <br/> The three-year grant, effective Aug. 15, is one of the largest research awards the
        college has received.<br/>

        <br/> Shortly before the Mariners home game with Boston, September 9, Les Purce, President
        of The Evergreen State College, and Charles Mitchell, Chancellor of the Seattle Community
        College System, will stand at home plate to award full-year scholarships to this
        year&amp;#39;s three recipients: Carlos Marentes, Mara Mercedes Surel and Tynesha Wilson.<br/>
        <br/> The scholarship, awarded in honor of baseball legend Jackie Robinson, whose life
        exemplified the ideals of social justice and community involvement, pays for one full year
        of tuition for students transferring from Seattle Central Community College to
        Evergreen.Carlos Marentes, a junior this fall, worked this summer with the Committee for
        General Amnesty and Social Justice, campaigning for immigrant rights. Marentes plans to
        obtain a doctoral degree and teach people of color in a higher education setting while
        maintaining involvement with social justice and community groups.Mara Mercedes Surel, a
        junior, will attend Evergreen&amp;#39;s Ethnic Studies program. While at SCCC, she served as
        Student Ambassador and was President of United Brothers and Sisters. This summer she worked
        and volunteered as a Summer Book Buddy for Seattle Youth Tutoring Program&amp;#39;s REAL
        program which helps at-risk youth living in publish housing improve their reading
        skills.Tynesha Wilson, also a junior, plans to attend Evergreen&amp;#39;s Tacoma campus in
        spring for Child Studies. At SCCC, Wilson was a Student Leader Ambassador and organized an
        area on campus called &amp;quot;Spot&amp;quot; where students could learn about student
        leadership and organizations on campus.</p>
       <p>A limited number of specially-commissioned posters of Jackie Robinson will be distributed
        to early-arriving fans at the ballgame. The poster, showing Jackie Robinson at bat for the
        Montreal Royals in 1946, was designed by Evergreen alumna Tina Hoggatt, a public artist and
        arts educator from Issaquah. Her permanent artwork, &amp;quot;The Positions on the
        Field&amp;quot; is installed on the third concourse in Safeco Field.Jackie Robinson
        Scholarship Night at Safeco Field is made possible with the support of The Seattle Times,
        The Kenneth and Marleen Alhadeff Charitable Foundation, Mariners Care and Washington
        Mutual.Since 1987 Evergreen has awarded a scholarship in the name of Jackie Robinson to a
        student of color to attend Evergreen. For the third consecutive year, The Evergreen State
        College is teaming up with the Seattle Mariners and Seattle Central Community College for
        the presentation at Safeco Field. Patrick and Maureen Hill established the Jackie Robinson
        Scholarship in 1987 as a gift in memory of their parents. Hill, a member of the Evergreen
        faculty, served as the college&amp;#39;s Provost and Academic Vice President from
        1983-90.</p>

       <p>Tuesday, September 7th, Lab I 1037<br/>
        <br/> Chris Abani, a Nigerian writer currently living in Los Angeles, is the author of
        numerous books, including DAPHNE&amp;#39;s LOT (poetry) and DOG WOMAN (fiction). His book of
        poems KALAKUTA REPUBLIC is based on his experience as a political prisoner in Nigeria
        between 1985 and 1991.<br/>
        <br/> Chris Abani&amp;#39;s Dog Woman is a mesmerizing, haunting, and sometime subversive
        exploration of the personal and cultural politics of disempowerment and power. In these
        heart rousing and lyrically complex poems, the poet enacts the reconstruction of his
        feminized selves, and his personae struggle to re-form and transform both themselves and the
        difficult worlds they inhabit. At turns, earthy, enigmatic, devout, outraged, and
        compassionate, these elemental women&amp;#39;s voices ring true, as they sing siren songs,
        dirges, and hosannas, and as they navigate into new and unknown territories of human will
        and endurance. Dog Woman is a daring, trailblazing, and important book; it&amp;#39;s a vital
        addition to the poetry of our times.<br/>
        <em>- Maurya Simon, author of Ghost Orchid.</em><br/>
        <br/> These poems reveal a prodigious imagination, which is enlivened by sardonic wit and an
        inexhaustible capacity for irony and empathy. Daring to span a historical continuum that
        takes us as far back as the rituals of Christ suffering, through the tragic history of the
        Mayans of Mexico, to the starkly modern concerns of contemporary life, these poems find
        beauty and grace in the most painful things. The achievement here lies in the poet&amp;#39;s
        ability to bring an engaging intelligence to bear on the complexities of race, gender and
        memory. Abani&amp;#39;s line has a sharp precision that turns a scream into a line of
        memorable lyric music without losing the emotion and force. That he does this again and
        again in poems of such vulnerability speaks highly of Abani&amp;#39;s art.<br/>
        <em>- Kwame Dawes, author of Midland.</em><br/>

       <p>Ann Daley, vice president for finance and administration at The Evergreen State College,
        will retire October 15 after almost four years at Evergreen. Daley&amp;#8217;s four years at
        Evergreen is only a small part of her notable 33-year career in government and public
        service.&amp;#160; While she is retiring from the public sector, Daley plans to remain
        active with part-time professional consulting, meditation, and teaching.</p>
       <p>Evergreen President Thomas L. &amp;#8220;Les&amp;#8221; Purce commented on the depth of
        Daley&amp;#8217;s commitment to the State of Washington:&amp;#160;
        &amp;#8220;Ann&amp;#8217;s career in public service is a tremendous contribution to the
        citizens of Washington&amp;#8230;all of us will miss her quick smile and down-to-earth
        approach to life.&amp;#8221;</p>
       <p>&amp;#160;Daley&amp;#8217;s knowledge of higher education policy and public administration
        is significant.&amp;#160; During her time at Evergreen, Daley was a key part of the
        development of the new Seminar II building.</p>
       <p>Prior to Daley&amp;#8217;s appointment at Evergreen in January of 2001, she served as
        director of the Environmental Hearings Office, was the first woman named as director of the
        Office of Financial Management, and was assistant state treasurer.&amp;#160; Daley also
        served as Executive Director of the Higher Education Coordinating Board, and served Govs.
        Booth Gardner and Gary Locke as a senior policy adviser.&amp;#160; Daley was elected in 2003
        to the Group Health Cooperative Board of Trustees, where she currently serves.</p>

       <p>Dime&amp;#39;s Worth of Difference challenges the lesser of two evils theory, aiming a
        good portion of its critique at the liberal support for John Kerry and the Democratic Party.
        A must-read in this election year, it&amp;#39;s the new collection edited by Alexander
        Cockburn and Jeffrey St. Clair, editors of the popular radical website CounterPunch.org and
        the investigative newsletter CounterPunch.</p>
       <p>Dime&amp;#39;s Worth of Difference argues that the fake choice of the lesser of two evils
        still leaves you with evil. It doesn&amp;#39;t matter which door you chose. This timely book
        calls on progressives to begin a new movement outside the death-embrace of the Democratic
        Party.</p>
       <p>Nationally syndicated journalists Alexander Cockburn and Jeffrey St. Clair have
        co-authored numerous best--sellers, including Whiteout: The CIA, Drugs and The Press,
        Washington Babylon and Al Gore: A User&amp;#39;s Manual.</p>

       <p>National sustainability leader Dr. Anthony Cortese will speak at The Evergreen State
        College Wednesday, Oct. 20, about the critical role Evergreen and other colleges can play in
        leading a national shift toward sustainability.</p>
       <p>Cortese's talk will take place at Lecture Hall 1 at 6:00 p.m.</p>
       <p>Cortese is President of Second Nature, a nonprofit group promoting worldwide efforts to
        make sustainability and environmental sensitivity a "foundation of learning and practice at
        all educational levels." He is a former Commissioner of the Massachusetts Department of
        Environmental Protection, and was the first dean of environmental studies at Tufts
        University. He is currently an adviser to Presidential Candidate John Kerry.</p>
       <p>Cortese has led programs providing technical assistance and educational resources to over
        4,000 faculty and administrators at 500 colleges and universities in the United States.</p>
       <p>"Such a shift in the thinking, values and actions... calls for a long-term societal effort
        to make environmental and sustainability concerns a central theme in all education," Cortese
        says. "If we are to achieve a sustainable future... higher education must provide the
        awareness, knowledge, skills and values that equip individuals to pursue life goals in a
        manner that sustains human and non-human well-being for all current and future
        generations."</p>
       <p>Students, faculty, staff and community members are invited to both Dr. Cortese's talks,
        which are sponsored by several academic programs and student organizations.</p>

       <p class="clearing">An innovative pilot program aiming to increase carpooling and other
        alternative forms of travel to The Evergreen State College is being launched next week, and
        organizers say it could prevent the release of over 33 tons of carbon dioxide into the
        atmosphere throughout the academic year.<br/>
        <br/> Program participants can use many forms of alternative travel, like bicycling, taking
        the bus, and walking or jogging.<br/>
        <br/> The Evergreen Commuter Contest is a quarterly incentive program to encourage - and
        reward - commuters who use alternative modes of transportation. For the program to receive
        full grant funds, at least 250 faculty, staff, or students must participate for three
        academic quarters. Grant funds include $21,100 by the Thurston Regional Planning Council,
        and $9,000 from the Washington State Department of Transportation. Evergreen students wrote
        the grants.<br/>
        <br/> The program is designed to expand The Evergreen State College's ongoing commitment to
        sustainability in the transportation choices that the student body, staff, and faculty make
        in coming to campus every day. As a part of the program, ventilated clothing lockers will be
        purchased and installed at locations around the campus, additional bike racks have been
        installed, and a commuter information kiosk will be installed during winter quarter.<br/>
        <br/> The commuter contest highlights Evergreen's commitment to sustainability, and
        organizers say that an increase in students, staff, and faculty using alternative forms of
        transportation, it benefits the college and the environment. The Evergreen commute trip
        reduction team says that when more Evergreen community members use alternative forms of
        travel, it will circumvent further costly parking lot expansions, particularly as
        Evergreen's student body is planned to grow to 5,000 over the next ten years.<br/>
        <br/> Fall quarter's contest as a part of the new program begins October 25th, and runs for
        one week. The goal for the participants is to bike, hike, bus or carpool at least once a week.<br/>

        <br/> Center for Community-Based Learning and Action<br/>
        <br/> An expression of 15 years of hopes and dreams will come to life Monday, Oct. 18 as The
        Evergreen State College Center for Community-Based Learning and Action celebrates its grand opening.<br/>
        <br/> Gus Newport, a nationally known advocate for social and economic equality will be
        featured during the daylong opening celebration. The new center will act as a broad
        clearinghouse of information and resources about community development, organizing, and
        advocacy, for the entire community.<br/>
        <br/> Newport is currently the Executive Director of the Institute for Community Economics
        (ICE) based in Springfield, Mass. ICE is a nationwide group that works for fairer
        allocations of resources to assist low-income families through financial support and
        advocacy for community land trusts. The institute has provided more than $35 million in
        financing to non-profit groups in 30 states since 1979, and has one of the most well
        established community development loan funds in the United States.<br/>
        <br/> Newport directed the Dudley Street Neighborhood Initiative in Boston, Mass, and the
        Partnership for Neighborhood Initiative in Palm Beach County, Fl. He also served as the
        mayor of Berkeley, Calif. for two terms, and was a member of two United Nations
        sub-committees. Newport's work at the Dudley Street Neighborhood is documented in the book
        "Streets of Hope," and the video "Holding Ground." The Dudley Street Neighborhood project
        was one of the most impressive community-originated, and city-supported urban recovery
        models in recent years.<br/>
        <br/> Newton will deliver a keynote address on "The Essential Role of Analysis and Planning
        in Rebuilding Disinvested Communities" at 6:30 p.m. at the college's Communications Building
        Recital Hall. Prior to the address, an open house at the Center for Community Based Learning
        and Action will take place from 4 to 6 p.m. at Seminar II, E-2115.<br/>
        <br/> Full Schedule of Events:<br/>
        <br/>
        <strong>1:00-4:00 p.m. - Lecture Hall 4</strong><br/>

       <p>Jason Kilmer, an addictive behaviors specialist at The Evergreen State College, has been
        named the &amp;#8220;mid-level student affairs professional of the year&amp;#8221; at a
        regional conference, and will represent Evergreen at a national student affairs conference
        as a nominee for the national award.</p>
       <p>Kilmer was honored October 29th in Boise, Id. at the regional conference of the National
        Association of Student Personnel Administrators.</p>
       <p>The association cited Kilmer&amp;#8217;s unique ability to connect with students on a
        personal level and effectively provide them with information they need to make informed
        decisions. &amp;#8220;It is Jason&amp;#8217;s incredible combination of research skills,
        presentation ability, personal traits, and commitment that make him such an effective
        educator and an outstanding mid-level professional,&amp;#8221; says Elizabeth McHugh,
        director of Evergreen&amp;#8217;s Health and Counseling Services, in a letter to the
        association.</p>
       <p>Kilmer says receiving the award is a real honor, and he&amp;#8217;s excited to represent
        Evergreen as a nominee for the national award. &amp;#8220;I work with a great group of
        people, and appreciate all the support I have received from my colleagues,&amp;#8221; he
        said.</p>
       <p>Mike Segawa, associate dean for student development at the University of Puget Sound, and
        former Evergreen housing director, also praised Kilmer&amp;#8217;s work.</p>
       <p>He &amp;#8220;is passionate about students, student learning, and harm
        reduction&amp;#8230;he is an incredibly talented researcher but he is not condescending, and
        he is a gifted public presenter, but he never lets that overshadow the message he
        brings,&amp;#8221; Segawa said.</p>
       <p>Kilmer has been employed at The Evergreen State College since 1999, and graduated from the
        University of Washington with a Ph.D. in Clinical Psychology. In addition to being a member
        of the counseling center staff, he also teaches in the part-time studies program as an
        adjunct member of the faculty at Evergreen.</p>
       <p>Kilmer has numerous publications in print and is chairperson of the Thurston and Mason
        County Dependency Advisory Board.</p>

       <p>(Portland, Ore.) &amp;#8211; The Evergreen Sustainable Home Project, a collaborative
        project of The Evergreen State College and South Puget Sound Habitat for Humanity has won a
        national leadership award.&amp;#160;</p>
       <p>The award, presented by the Healthy Building Network, is dedicated to one organization
        each year for efforts made to advance the use of building materials that protect human
        health and promote environmental integrity throughout their lifecycle. The Evergreen and
        Habitat for Humanity project designed an affordable and efficient single-family home in West
        Olympia.&amp;#160; Students in Evergreen&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8220;Eco Design&amp;#8221;
        program designed the house.</p>
       <p>Evergreen student Luke Howard and local green building activist Tom St. Louis took key
        roles in the project.</p>
       <p>The home has received high praise from the Olympia Master Builders Association, and was
        featured on their &amp;#8220;Parade of Homes&amp;#8221; during the summer of 2004.&amp;#160;
        The house exceeds a &amp;#8220;Three Star Built Green&amp;#8221; rating by over 400 points,
        and the state Department of Natural Resources uses the home to show the public how to build
        houses that are wildfire resistant in urban areas.</p>
       <p>According to a press release from the Healthy Building Network, the group is a national
        network of green building professionals, environmental and health activists, socially
        responsible investment advocates and others who are interested in promoting healthier
        building materials as a means of improving public health and preserving the global
        environment. HBN focuses on promoting alternatives to particularly unhealthy building
        materials such as arsenic treated wood and PVC.</p>
       <p>The Leadership Award was presented last week at BOORA Architects in participation with the
        Greenbuild International Conference and Expo in Portland, Ore.</p>

       <p>The Evans Library building is being renovated from the ground up. The exterior appearance
        will largely remain the same - but the interior of the building is being reborn.</p>
       <p>The project aims to make the 360,000 square foot building more energy efficient and to
        create a more effective learning and working environment for Evergreen&amp;#39;s 4400
        students and nearly 800 faculty and staff.</p>
       <p>While some work has already started in the library building, major construction will begin
        in March. To accommodate the first phase of construction, 137,765 books - about half of the
        entire college collection - have been moved to other locations in the building. The college
        archives and rare books collections are also being moved.</p>
       <p>The project was listed as one of the top facilities priority by all of the state&amp;#39;s
        four-year institutions, and is broken up into two phases. The $21 million first phase
        includes the library, computer, photo, and media areas and other spaces of the building. The
        second phase, planned to begin design in 2005, will focus on the administrative offices,
        classrooms, and the fourth floor. Seismic, structural, life safety and indoor air quality
        improvements are being made during both phases.</p>
       <p>The Evergreen library will remain open during the renovation and will continue to serve
        students as well as residents of the greater community. For more information about services
        and resources that the Evergreen library offers to residents of the greater Olympia area,
        call the reference and information desk at (360) 867-6252.</p>

       <p>&amp;quot;gW3dZa&amp;#39;dad&amp;quot; is a Twana term from the Pacific Northwest that
        describes &amp;quot;the teaching of ancestral knowledge&amp;quot;, according to renowned
        cultural leader Bruce Subiyay Miller of the Skokomish tribe, a recent recipient of the
        National Heritage Award through the National Endowment for the Arts.&amp;#160;</p>
       <p>The Longhouse&amp;#39;s artist-in-residence program brings master Native artists to work
        with emerging and established Native artists at the Evergreen campus and reservation sites.
        Pete Peterson, Sr., a master carver and elder from the Skokomish tribe instructed five
        artists on the traditional cultural art form of bent wood box making.</p>
       <p>Susan Pavel, who apprenticed under Bruce Miller, instructed 18 pairs of adults and youth
        apprentices in an ancient weaving technique of the Coast Salish people. The regalia that was
        created by the weavers will be on exhibit and will also be featured in a regalia fashion
        show at the Longhouse during Super Saturday, June 11, 2005.</p>

       <p>The Thurston Council on Cultural Diversity and Human Rights honored Evergreen faculty
        members Carol Minugh and Jos&amp;#233; G&amp;#243;mez Monday, Dec. 14. The two faculty
        members both received the unique achievement award from the council for their work in the
        community.</p>
       <p>Carol Minugh is director of the Gateways for Incarcerated Youth program at The Evergreen
        State College. The program brings Evergreen students into the Green Hill School and Maple
        Lane School juvenile detention facilities operated by the state Juvenile Rehabilitation
        Administration. In the nine years that Minugh has coordinated the program, hundreds of
        Evergreen students have worked side by side as co-learners with incarcerated youth at the
        facilities.</p>
       <p>One of the priorities of the program is to prepare the incarcerated youth for college or
        further learning. Minugh generally oversees 25 to 30 Evergreen students in the facilities on
        a weekly basis working with the young men. The program also features a college-preparatory
        component to prepare youth for college, and earn limited college credit while they are still
        incarcerated.</p>
       <p>Carol Minugh&amp;#8217;s academic work has focused on participatory research, culture and
        behavior, and indigenous people. She graduated with a Doctorate of Education from
        Pennsylvania State Univ. in 1981.</p>
       <p>Faculty member Jos&amp;#233; G&amp;#243;mez was also honored for his significant work in
        co-chairing Evergreen&amp;#8217;s weeklong commemoration last May of the 50th anniversary of
        the U.S. Supreme Court&amp;#8217;s Brown v. Board of Education decision. The
        &amp;#8220;Search for Equality&amp;#8221; series of events were held at both the Evergreen
        Olympia campus as well as the Tacoma campus. The commemoration was one of the most
        comprehensive in the nation, according to author and constitutional scholar Peter Irons, who
        delivered the keynote address.</p>
       <p>Nationally known guest speakers were featured during the series of events as well as
        student and community performances and a film series. The events also attracted members of
        the public from throughout the area.</p>
       <p>G&amp;#243;mez has been a member of Evergreen&amp;#8217;s faculty for sixteen years, and
        graduated from Harvard Law School in 1981. He also organizes The Evergreen Supreme Court, an
        appellate advocacy program as a part of his law programs.</p>

       <p>An art exhibit at <a href="http://www.evergreen.edu/gallery/home.htm">The Evergreen State
         College Gallery</a> features Seattle visionary artist <strong>Sewa Singh Khalsa</strong>
        The exhibition will showcase miniature porcelain sculptures, paintings, prints and drawings.
        Khalsa&amp;#8217;s work comes from a deep interest in organic form and spirit. He is a
        master of clay and pushes the material beyond normal limits and expectations.</p>
       <p>Some of the delicate porcelains are delightful little worlds by themselves while the
        single pieces are interesting and full of good-natured humor. His paintings and drawings
        show a playfulness that is both childlike and fearless.</p>

        sixty miles south of Seattle. Take the I-5 to exit 104 (Hwy 101 North) and follow the signs

        training workshops in Israel, Palestine, Egypt, Turkey, Switzerland, Sierra Leone and the
        United States. He has published articles in the Journal of Peace and Changes, the American
        Journal of Economics and Sociology, and in various books.<br/>

       <p>OLYMPIA, WA - March 1, 2005- Both houses of the Washington State Legislature will honor
        The Evergreen State College&amp;#39;s athletics program this legislative session.</p>
       <p>The house of representatives recognized the exceptional performance of Evergreen&amp;#39;s
        men&amp;#39;s soccer team Feb. 9, and Senator Jeanne Kohl-Welles of Seattle will introduce a
        resolution in the senate later this week honoring extraordinary performances by the
        Evergreen crew team as well as the women&amp;#39;s soccer, and women&amp;#39;s basketball
        teams.</p>
       <p>The men&amp;#39;s soccer team won their first-ever NAIA Region I championship with shutout
        victories in their 2004 season, and reached the quarterfinals of the NAIA national
        championships after a 2-1 victory over the reigning national champs, the University of Rio
        Grande.</p>
       <p>In that victory, the Evergreen men also ended Rio Grande&amp;#39;s 63-game winning streak.
        Senior Joe Gjertsen, who holds The Evergreen State College record in scoring, was named as
        the Cascade Collegiate Conference player of the week twice, Conference player of the year,
        All-Region and All-American.</p>
       <p>Other players honored were Senior Nate Ford, who booted the winning goal against Rio
        Grande, juniors Greg Preciado, Zephyr Titus, and sophomore Dan Jones. Team coach Tom
        Boatright was named the Region I coach of the year.</p>
       <p>State Reps. Gary Alexander, Sam Hunt and Pat Sullivan sponsored the house resolution
        honoring the men&amp;#39;s soccer team.</p>
       <p>Junior Alisha White of the Evergreen&amp;#39;s women&amp;#39;s soccer team was named to
        the NAIA All-America team. The Geoducks finished with eight victories in their last 10
        games.</p>
       <p>Senior Heather Hyde and sophomore Jenny Olson were named All-Cascade Conference in
        women&amp;#39;s basketball as Evergreen recorded its best-ever overall record and highest
        finish in the Cascade Conference.</p>
       <p>The Evergreen women&amp;#39;s crew team competed in the Dad Vail Regatta in Philadelphia,
        Pa. last spring - the nation&amp;#39;s largest collegiate event, and out rowed a number of
        NCAA Division I schools.</p>

        featuring the world-premiere of &amp;quot;Songs from the Dao De Jing&amp;quot; by Linda
        Waterfall, and the 1973 piece &amp;quot;Cloud Cuckoo U.&amp;quot; composed by satirist,

        Jing&amp;quot; in English and Chinese, using Taoist poetry as her texts. Authentic Chinese
        violins - called Erhu&amp;#39;s - and percussion will accompany the choir during
        Waterfall&amp;#39;s piece.</p>
       <p>The Singers will present Stilson&amp;#39;s satiric musical based on Aristophanes&amp;#39;
        &amp;quot;The Birds&amp;quot; in oratorio form. Faculty members Marla Beth Elliott and
        Stephanie Claire direct the 55-member choir.</p>

       <p>OLYMPIA, Wash. -- Evergreen says good-bye to a former Evergreen Trustee and life-long
        champion of education, civil rights and social justice. Frederick &amp;quot;Fred&amp;quot;
        Haley died Monday, April 4 at his home in Lakebay, following a brief illness. Haley served
        on The Evergreen State College Board of Trustees from 1991 through 1997. He is remembered at
        Evergreen for his integrity, his deep commitment to civil rights and his steadfast support
        of the college. His work at Evergreen is just one example from a long life in public
        service. He participated in the 1963 March on Washington and, as a member of the Tacoma
        School Board, fought for desegregation and to protect the civil rights of teachers. In his
        professional life, he was CEO of the candy manufacturing company Brown &amp;#38; Haley.
        Haley was 92-years-old.</p>

        <strong>High Marks on Grant Application Give Evergreen Additional Funding for Student
         Services</strong>
       </p>
       <p>OLYMPIA, WA <strong>-</strong> In an unprecedented move, the U.S. Department of Education
        has awarded The Evergreen State College&amp;#39;s KEY Student Support Services with a $1.4
        million grant to be distributed over a five-year period. The newly-awarded grant allows
        Evergreen to continue a 24-year tradition of providing services to undergraduate students
        who are low income, first generation or students with disabilities. Services include
        academic planning, tutoring, financial aid counseling, career and graduate school advising
        and cultural activities. The initial grant application submitted in August 2004 was for a
        four-year award, but the high scores Evergreen achieved during the review process resulted
        in a generous five-year award.</p>
       <p>Since 1977, the Evergreen KEY program, which stands for Keep Enhancing Yourself, has
        advised and assisted nearly 200 students per year, helping pave the way to program
        completion and graduation. The KEY program is part of TRIO, a federal educational
        opportunity program that was established in the 1960s.</p>
       <p>&amp;quot;We are thrilled to be awarded the grant again this year and the extra year of
        funding we received was a greatly appreciated surprise,&amp;quot; said Niki Amarantides,
        director of Evergreen&amp;#39;s KEY Student Services. &amp;quot;These are federal programs
        that really work to support students&amp;#39; success,&amp;quot; said Amarantides.
        &amp;quot;Students who never dreamed of attending college are graduating, thanks to the
        efforts of the KEY services.&amp;quot;</p>
       <p>Evergreen also is one of 10 colleges in the country awarded a $10,000 start-up grant by
        the Association of American Colleges and Universities, made possible by the Greve Foundation
        of New York. The start-up grant will support the collaborative work of Student Affairs and
        Academic Affairs in engaged learning opportunities and their relation to the health and
        civic lives of Evergreen students. Faculty, Student Affairs practitioners and students will
        work together to implement various activities over the coming year.</p>

       <h2>Evergreen&amp;#39;s SEM II Building Named One of 2005&amp;#39;s Top Ten
        &amp;quot;Green&amp;quot; Projects by American Institute of Architects</h2>
       <p>OLYMPIA, WA -- The American Institute of Architects (AIA) Committee on the Environment
        (COTE) today named The Evergreen State College&amp;#39;s Seminar II building as one of the
         <em>2005 Top Ten &amp;quot;Green&amp;quot; Projects.</em> The annual awards were developed
        in partnership with the U.S. Department of Energy and are presented to honor architectural
        design solutions that protect and enhance the environment.</p>
       <p>The 153,000-square-foot academic facility, known as &amp;quot;SEM II,&amp;quot; reflects
        Evergreen&amp;#39;s interdisciplinary teaching philosophy and commitment to environmental
        advocacy and practice. The building was opened and dedicated last spring by then Governor
        Gary Locke and has been submitted to the U.S. Green Building Council to be considered for
        the distinguished Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Gold Certification.
        Mahlum Architects of Seattle designed the building.</p>
       <p>The Evergreen community played a substantial role in the design of the structure with
        faculty, staff and students serving on the design committee that advised the architects.
        &amp;quot;We wanted SEM II to be a living, working example of sustainability-one of
        Evergreen&amp;#39;s core values,&amp;quot; said Evergreen President, Les Purce.
        &amp;quot;Here, sustainability is simultaneously meeting environmental, economic and
        community needs.&amp;quot;</p>
       <p>Evergreen&amp;#39;s award demonstrates its leadership role in the progressive move toward
        green building and represents the growing market transformation under way in the country and
        around the world. Earlier this month, Washington state Gov. Christine Gregoire signed
        legislation making Washington the first state in the country to require public buildings to
        be constructed with standards encouraging energy conservation and recycling.</p>
       <p>The AIA&amp;#39;s <em>Top Ten &amp;quot;Green&amp;quot; Projects</em> program recognizes
        projects that address significant environmental challenges with designs that integrate
        architecture, technology and natural systems. Projects are evaluated for their contributions
        to their sites and existing ecosystems, connection to the surrounding community, use of
        high-performance technologies, energy use and sensitive use of materials and resources.
        Evergreen&amp;#39;s building includes many sustainable attributes and practices including
        use of natural light and ventilation, external hallways to minimize energy consumption
        required for heating and cooling, water-saving features like waterless urinals and
        rainwater-holding gardens that reduce runoff.</p>
       <p>The SEM II building will be featured at the AIA National Convention in Las Vegas in May
        and at the National Building Museum in Washington, D.C.</p>
       <p>

       <p>The Evergreen State College is one of the nation&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;best value&amp;quot;
        undergraduate institutions according to The Princeton Review.&amp;#160; The New York-based
        education services company chose Evergreen as one of 81 schools it recommends in the new
        2006 edition of its book, America&amp;#39;s Best Value Colleges (Random House / Princeton
        Review, $15.95), on sale April 19, 2005.&amp;#160; The book is a guide to colleges with
        outstanding academics, generous financial aid packages and relatively low costs.&amp;#160;
        It includes public and private colleges and universities in 35 states.&amp;#160; The
        Princeton Review has a complete list of the schools in the book on its Web site <a
         href="http://www.princetonreview.com/">www.PrincetonReview.com</a>.</p>
       <p>The book cites Evergreen as &amp;quot;a public, ultra-progressive liberal arts
        school&amp;quot; offering what most colleges cannot, &amp;quot;private college amenities and
        class sizes at a public university price.&amp;quot; The Review refers to Evergreen students
        as &amp;quot;residents who have distinguish themselves in a wide range of areas, including
        academics, community service, art, journalism and science.&amp;quot;</p>
       <p>The Princeton Review selected the schools for the book based on data the company obtained
        from administrators at over 350 colleges, and surveys of students attending them.&amp;#160;
        Says Robert Franek, V.P.-Publishing, The Princeton Review, &amp;quot;We used over 30 factors
        to rate the colleges in four categories: Academics, Tuition GPA (the sticker price minus
        average amount students receive in scholarships and grants), Financial Aid (how well
        colleges meet students&amp;#39; financial need), and Student Borrowing.&amp;#160; Bottom
        line: the 81 schools that met our criteria for this book are all great college education
        deals.&amp;quot;</p>

       <p>OLYMPIA, Wash. -- The Habitat for Humanity home, known locally as the Evergreen
        Sustainable Home (1104 Brawne Ave, Olympia), was dedicated on Friday, May 6. The home was
        designed by students in Evergreen&amp;#39;s Ecological Design program and some artistic
        embellishments, such as the reliefs above the windows, were designed by students in
        Evergreen&amp;#39;s Art in Place program. Academic Vice President and Provost, Don Bantz,
        represented the college at the dedication.</p>
       <p>According to participants in the project, the house is beautiful and one of the best homes
        Habitat For Humanity has built anywhere -- and a proud accomplishment of members of the
        Evergreen community. Construction supervisor, Jerry Fugich, also is an Evergreen
        alumnus.&amp;#160;</p>
       <p>Evergreen continues to participate and facilitate environmental planning and advocacy work
        as a core value of the college. On Earth Day, Evergreen received national recognition as the
        college&amp;#39;s Seminar II building was named one of the Top Eight
        &amp;quot;Green&amp;quot; Projects by the American Institute of Architects.</p>

       <p>The Peace Corps has announced that, for the first time ever, the organization will send a
        team of Crisis Corps volunteers to Sri Lanka, including Evergreen alumnus and Olympia
        resident, Nels Christianson. According to a Peace Corps press release, Christianson will
        leave at the end of this month to help the people of Sri Lanka recover from last
        year&amp;#39;s devastating tsunamis. He will serve as a civil engineer with the Christian
        Children&amp;#39;s Fund and work to develop and design projects to rebuild Sri
        Lanka&amp;#39;s damaged communities. He also will work with other Crisis Corps civil
        engineers to assess the Fund&amp;#39;s current projects and make recommendations on ways to
        improve them. Christianson holds a degree in computer science and management from Evergreen
        and a degree in civil engineering from the University of Washington. Previously, he served
        as a water engineering volunteer for the Peace Corps in Kenya from 1978 to 1980, where he
        worked with the Ministry of Water Development to create rural water supply systems. He also
        has worked with the charity organization Africare to design and improve water systems in
        Somalian refugee camps. Before joining the Crisis Corps, Christianson was a computer analyst
        and programmer for the Washington State Energy Office.</p>
       <p>The Sri Lankan support effort will mark one of the few occasions when a Crisis Corps team
        of volunteers has been sent to a nation with no regular Peace Corps program. The Peace Corps
        closed its Sri Lanka program in 1998. The government of Sri Lanka estimates that more than
        30,000 citizens died in the tsunamis that killed more than 176,000 people in 11 countries.
        Some 500,000 Sri Lankans lost their homes.</p>

       <p><strong>OLYMPIA, Wash. -</strong> The Evergreen State College Class of 2005 will take that
        long-awaited walk down flashbulb alley, with 1,191 undergraduates and 82 graduates expected
        to pick up their degrees.</p>
       <p>Commencement is scheduled for Friday, June 10 on Red Square at the Olympia campus,
        starting at 1 p.m., rain or shine. Award-winning author, Derrick Jensen, is the keynote
        speaker at the event, which is free and open to the public.</p>
       <p>Evergreen will award 1,036 bachelor of arts, 105 bachelor of science, 50 bachelor of arts
        and science combined, 33 master of teaching, 23 master of environmental studies and 26
        master of public administration degrees.</p>
       <p>Speaker Jensen was selected by the Class of 2005. Jensen, in his own words, shares his
        multi-dimensional teachings about the nature of injustice - of what civilizations do to the
        natural world and how civilized human beings create intricate systems of denial, silence,
        abnegation, deception and self-hatred in order to keep the consequences of such injustice at
        bay. He is the author of <em>The Culture of Make Believe</em> and <em>A Language Older Than
         Words.</em> Jensen has taken his education and activism to incredible heights. He serves as
        associate editor for <em>Transitions</em> magazine, is co-founder of the Railroads and
        Clearcuts Campaign and sits on advisory boards for the Del Norte Association for Cultural
        Awareness and the Native Forest Network. He also is a member of the drafting committee for
        the articulation of a new food production ethic, sponsored by the Center for Respect of Life
        and Environment.</p>
       <p>Graduation addresses also will be given by Evergreen faculty member Caryn Cline (film and
        media studies); Vanessa Schweizer, Master of Environmental Studies; and Dolly England,
        Bachelor of Arts.</p>
       <p>While completing her Masters degree at Evergreen, Schweizer worked full time as a faculty
        and staff member at Pierce College-Fort Steilacoom.&amp;#160;In the winter of 2005 she
        worked as a Science and Technology Policy Graduate Fellow in Washington, D.C., at the
        National Academy of Sciences and the National Research Council.&amp;#160;She has been
        admitted to Carnegie Mellon University's doctoral program in Engineering and Public
        Policy.</p>
       <p>England is a first generation student and has attended Evergreen all four
        years.&amp;#160;In her time at Evergreen, she was a Cultural Diversity Award recipient, a
        First Peoples' Scholar and a Resident Assistant. She served also as coordinator of Umoja,
        Evergreen's Black Student Union.</p>
       <p>The Class of 2005 has chosen the theme, "Everything changes, nothing remains without
        change," by Shakyamuni Buddha. On behalf of the graduating class, proceeds from the sale of
        graduation announcements and T-shirts will be donated to Safeplace, an Olympia shelter for
        women and children.</p>
       <p>Evergreen's 34th Commencement ceremonies are dedicated to former Evergreen Trustee and
        life-long champion of education, civil rights and social justice; Frederick "Fred" Haley.
        Haley, who passed away last April, served on The Evergreen State College Board of Governors
        and as a member of the Board of Trustees from 1991 through 1997. He is remembered at
        Evergreen for his integrity, his deep commitment to civil rights and his steadfast support
        of the college. His work at Evergreen is just one example from a long life in public
        service. He participated in the 1963 March on Washington and, as a member of the Tacoma
        School Board, fought for desegregation and to protect the civil rights of teachers. In his
        professional life, he was CEO of the candy manufacturing company Brown &amp; Haley.</p>
       <p>Former state senator and gay and lesbian rights advocate Cal Anderson also will be honored
        at Friday's Commencement, where an Honorary Bachelor of Arts degree will be posthumously
        bestowed. Anderson will receive the distinct honor in recognition of his tireless efforts as
        a deeply committed public servant, a champion of civil rights and an accomplished
        legislator. Anderson was appointed to the Washington state House of Representatives in 1987,
        where he was elected to three full terms after completing his original appointment. In 1994,
        Seattle's 43rd district elected him to the state Senate where he served until his death in
        1995. A Vietnam-era veteran, Anderson was awarded two Bronze Stars and four U.S. Army
        Commendation Medals. Anderson labored for campaign finance and regulatory reform,
        motor-voter registration, veterans' issues, environmental protection and open access to
        government. He introduced many bills related to AIDS programs and led the on-going battle
        for equal civil rights protection for gay and lesbian citizens.</p>
       <p>Commencement will be carried live on KAOS Community Radio at 89.3 FM and online at <a
         href="http://www.kaosradio.org/" target="_blank">www.kaosradio.org</a>. The event also will
        be streamed via live Webcast at www.evergreen.edu/media/live.</p>
       <p>Graduates of The Evergreen State College - Tacoma will be honored at a celebration on
        Saturday, June 11 starting at 1 p.m. at downtown Tacoma's Rialto Theater (9th and Broadway).
        Retired Evergreen-Tacoma faculty member Dr. Willie L. Parson will be the featured speaker.
        This year, 101 Tacoma Program students will receive their bachelor degrees during
        Commencement ceremonies at Evergreen's Olympia campus.</p>
       <p>The Evergreen State College, a public, four-year college of arts and sciences, annually
        enrolls more than 4,100 students. Evergreen opened its doors in 1971. Since then, it has
        become a national leader in the development of interdisciplinary learning communities that
        combine and coordinate several academic subjects that are traditionally taught
        separately.</p>

       <p>OLYMPIA, Wash. - Already a veteran in the world of environmental architecture awards,
        Evergreen&amp;#8217;s Seminar II building, known locally as &amp;#8220;Sem II,&amp;#8221; is
        receiving yet more recognition for its leading edge design. The Green Roofs for Healthy
        Cities recently awarded Sem II&amp;#8217;s roof developer, The Garland Company, Inc., of
        Cleveland, with the 2005 Green Roof Award of Excellence in the Extensive Institutional
        category.</p>
       <p>Garland is a leading U.S. manufacturer and worldwide distributor of high-performance
        roofing and building maintenance systems. The environmental design minimizes the
        roof&amp;#8217;s exposure to heat and ultraviolet rays that can prematurely age roofing
        materials. The roof, which is covered with various low growing plant life, is expected to
        last more than 30 years, due to its sustainable attributes. The plant-growing medium was
        Garland&amp;#8217;s Oasis lightweight media mixture and the vegetation includes sedums and
        up to 33 various perennial flowering species. In addition, all rainwater filters through the
        green roof system and overflows into a 20,000-gallon reservoir designed to slowly release
        water back into the local environment. The process significantly reduces the size of storm
        water retention ponds needed for the building.</p>
       <p>The award-winning roof project was designed to reflect the progressive mission of The
        Evergreen State College and exemplify one of its core values, environmental sustainability.
        Green Roofs for Healthy Cities North America Inc. is a nonprofit industry association. The
        Green Roof Awards of Excellence were established in 2003 to recognize green roof projects
        that exhibit extraordinary leadership in integrated design and implementation.</p>

       <p><strong>OLYMPIA, Wash. --</strong> The major college guidebooks once again highlight the
        affordability and strong academics of The Evergreen State College. A new guidebook written
        by college students names Evergreen one of "America's top 100 schools."</p>
       <p>The new "Students Guide to Colleges," published by Penguin, is based on a "survey of
        thousands of college students" and cites Evergreen as one of the "Top 10 Schools You've
        Never Heard Of."</p>
       <p>The "Students Guide" includes student comments such as, "Evergreen is a renowned liberal
        arts college that moves progressively beyond popular education by emphasizing learning and
        scholarship over grades. It is a perfect environment for independently ambitious
        thinkers."</p>
       <p>The Princeton Review's listing of "The Best 361 Colleges" named Evergreen one of the "Best
        in the West," specifically a "Best Value College."</p>
       <p>U.S. News and World Report's 2006 edition of "America's Best Colleges" ranks Evergreen
        sixth on a list of liberal arts colleges where students "graduate with the least amount of

        experiences," best "learning communities" and best "internship cooperative education
        programs" in higher education.</p>

        <em>Tom Kenna from UCSD named Head Men&amp;#39;s Basketball Coach at The Evergreen State
         College</em>
       </p>
       <p><strong>OLYMPIA, Wash.</strong> - Tom Kenna has accepted the position of head
        men&amp;#39;s basketball coach and recreation manager at The Evergreen State College. Kenna
        most recently served as associate head coach at the University of California San Diego, an
        NCAA Division II school. Kenna&amp;#39;s previous coaching posts include stints at Long
        Beach State University in Long Beach, Calif., where he served as assistant coach, and Spring
        Hill College in Mobile, Ala., where he served as interim head men&amp;#39;s coach from 2002
        to 2003 and as lead assistant coach from 1999-2002. As head coach, Kenna led his Spring Hill
        team to the &amp;quot;Final Four&amp;quot; of its conference tournament. His team ranked as
        high as sixth in the nation and held the distinction of being the number one defensive team
        in the nation.</p>
       <p>Coach Kenna&amp;#39;s newly appointed position also includes duties as recreational
        manager for Evergreen&amp;#39;s College Recreation Center, where he will develop, implement
        and oversee recreational programs. In addition to coaching, he served Spring Hill College as
        the coordinator for recreation and intramurals. Kenna holds a Master of Business
        Administration with a specialization in sports administration and a Bachelor of Business in
        sports administration from St. Thomas University in Miami.</p>
       <p>&amp;quot;Both education and athletics are important to me, so I feel fortunate to be able
        to coach at an educational institution that fosters and embraces individual thinking and
        ideas,&amp;quot; said Kenna. &amp;quot;Evergreen basketball fans can expect to see a strong
        defense and successful execution of our offense. I know Evergreen has built a solid program
        and has enjoyed success in the conference. I want to build on that success and take it to
        the next level while providing an exciting brand of play.&amp;quot;</p>
       <p>Kenna said he hopes his contribution to the college will also benefit the health of the
        community. &amp;quot;I want to encourage and promote an active lifestyle and get people out
        here to campus, whether that&amp;#39;s as a fan of the basketball team or as a participant
        in a rec activity or fitness program.&amp;quot;</p>
       <p>&amp;quot;Tom is the right coach for Evergreen at this moment and I think Evergreen is the
        right job for Tom at this point in his career,&amp;quot; said Evergreen Athletic Director
        Dave Weber. &amp;quot;It was obvious to us that he&amp;#39;s really ready to step up and be
        a head coach full time. He&amp;#39;s had a small amount of head coaching experience and has
        also worked in some great programs as an assistant.&amp;quot;</p>
       <p>Weber said he and members of the men&amp;#39;s team were very impressed with the hour
        Kenna spent working on the court with the players as part of the interview process.</p>
       <p>&amp;quot;He connected well and wasn&amp;#39;t afraid to step in and make corrections,
        even though he knew the players were providing feedback on his performance,&amp;quot; said
        Weber. &amp;quot;We think Coach Kenna will pick up the program and push it forward with
        little delay. In our conference, you can&amp;#39;t afford a lot of rebuilding years because
        nobody else is going to slow down and wait for you.&amp;quot; In the 2005 season, Evergreen,
        an NAIA Division II college, finished fifth in the Cascade Conference that sent four of its
        32 teams to nationals. &amp;quot;Evergreen&amp;#39;s on the cusp of being one of those top
        teams and we think Tom can help get us to that point,&amp;quot; said Weber.</p>
       <p>Kenna replaces Evergreen&amp;#39;s first ever coach, John Barbee, who had served the
        basketball program since its inception eight years ago.</p>

       <p><strong>OLYMPIA, Wash. --</strong> The Boeing Company has announced a $24,350 gift to the
        Northwest Native American Reading Curriculum, a project co-sponsored by The Evergreen State
        College and led by Magda Costantino, director of the Evergreen Center for Educational
        Improvement and Denny Hurtado, director of the Office of Indian Education at the Office of
        the Superintendent of Public Instruction.</p>
       <p>The gift will support the printing of Native American Curriculum books that combine the
        learning components of reading, writing, communication and social studies. Costantino said
        &amp;quot;this program is important because children are our future, and we are very
        grateful to Boeing for this important gift.&amp;quot; Costantino continues, &amp;quot;these
        kids deserve our support.&amp;quot;</p>
       <p>The Northwest Native American Reading Curriculum is a research-based and culturally
        relevant supplemental curriculum for Washington students in grades K-2. The program aims to
        improve the effectiveness of education and elevate the reading levels of Native students in
        particular. Historically, Native American students have been among the lowest scoring groups
        on standardized tests, however recent scores have shown significant improvement among Native
        American students.</p>
       <p>The program hinges on allowing multiple opportunities for reading and writing stories from
        Native students&amp;#39; own cultural heritage. Generally shared by elders and other
        esteemed tribal members, the reading and retelling of the stories in the curriculum enhance
        students&amp;#39; communication skills for use in their communities and schools.</p>
       <p>The program has involved significant collaboration between teachers, tribal leaders, and
        curriculum experts to develop a framework for the program that includes three main
        strategies:</p>
       <p>&amp;#183; &amp;#183; <strong>Re-telling:</strong> Inviting participation by storytellers,
        tribal elders, and other adults from the students&amp;#39; communities.</p>
       <p>&amp;#183; &amp;#183; <strong>Now and Then:</strong> Students are provided with
        opportunities to analyze issues from both historical and contemporary standpoints.</p>
       <p>&amp;#183; &amp;#183; <strong>Comparison and Contrast:</strong> Students investigate the
        similarities and differences among different Washington Native American tribes while
        developing the students&amp;#39; higher order thinking skills.</p>
       <p>For more information on the program, contact Magda Costantino at (360) 867-6388</p>

       <p>OLYMPIA Wash. -- Evergreen&amp;#39;s Organic Farm offers several opportunities for
        community members to get their hands dirty, learn about organic gardening and see
        sustainable agriculture in action. The farm is open during daylight hours for self-guided
        tours of the gardens, the bio-diesel reactor and the animals raised on the farm. The Organic
        Farm is on the south edge of the campus at 2712 Lewis Road. Call 867-6160 in advance to
        arrange a group tour.<br/>
        <br/> Some of the produce grown on the farm goes to the college cafeteria where
        you&amp;#39;ll find a salad bar so enticing it was featured in the New York Times.<br/>
        <br/> If you love garden-fresh organic produce but don&amp;#39;t have room for a back yard
        garden, the farm has a couple of great solutions for you. For just $20 per season, you can
        rent a 10&amp;#39; X 10&amp;#39;community garden plot of your own at the farm. Grow all the
        tomatoes, corn, squash, herbs and whatever you&amp;#39;d like. The farm even throws in the
        free use of garden tools and access to irrigation water. Sign up in April by calling Jeremy
        Weiss, Community Garden Coordinator, at 867-6145.<br/>
        <br/> Don&amp;#39;t have the time to grow your own? You can buy organic produce grown on
        Evergreen&amp;#39;s farm at two west side locations - the farm itself, open daylight hours
        Monday through Friday, April through October, or at a produce stand on campus, in front of
        the library, open Tuesdays, Noon to 3 p.m. and Thursdays, 11 a.m. to 5 p.m., April through October.<br/>
        <br/> The farm is currently developing a Community Supported Agriculture program. For $20,
        participants receive a large box of Organic Farm vegetables, flowers and recipes every week
        - enough to feed a family of four. So far the CSA has limited availability. To get your name
        on the list, call Melissa Barker, Organic Farm Manager, at 867-6160.<br/>
        <br/> Produce not used in the cafeteria or sold at the stand is donated to the Olympia Food
        Bank.</p>
       <p><strong>College Invites Visitors to Harvest Festival</strong><br/> The 27th Annual Harvest
        Festival at The Evergreen State College&amp;#39;s Organic Farm is set for 12:30 to 8 p.m.
        Saturday, October 1. Events include tours of the farm and composting plant, kids&amp;#39;
        games, purchase of farm produce, storytelling and music. Visitors are asked to park on
        campus and walk to the farm, located on Lewis Road.</p>

        this week - as well as its largest-ever total enrollment at nearly 4500 students. Many
        students have been moving into college residence halls since last week in preparation for
        the first day of classes on Monday Sept. 26.</p>
       <p>Evergreen&amp;#39;s commitment to fostering student success and community involvement has
        been in full swing with faculty, staff and students organizing more than 80 different events
        during orientation week for new students. The week culminates with the All Student
        Convocation Friday Sept. 23&amp;#160;at 2 p.m. in the Longhouse Building. Convocation is
        Evergreen&amp;#39;s campus celebration marking the start of the academic year.</p>
       <p>As with the start of every academic year, motorists in the area of The Evergreen State
        College should be aware of heavier than normal traffic volumes on Evergreen Parkway as new
        students navigate their way around campus during the first week of school.</p>
       <p>Campus police and the campus parking office are taking steps to ease possible congestion
        in the area during the first few days of school. For the first three days of next week,
        campus parking will be free. After the first few days of school, traffic volumes should
        return to normal levels.</p>

         <strong>Gift provides significant start for Evergreen&amp;#39;s first ever capital
          campaign</strong>
        </em>
       </p>
       <p>OLYMPIA, Wash. - The Bill &amp;#38; Melinda Gates Foundation today announced it is making
        a contribution of $1 million to support the development of The Evergreen State
        College&amp;#39;s first ever capital campaign. The gift will help the college build
        fundraising capacity to sustain its distinctive excellence. The contribution will be
        announced at 10:30 a.m. today at Evergreen&amp;#39;s 2005 Convocation ceremonies on its
        Olympia campus.</p>
       <p>When Evergreen opened in 1971, Governor Dan Evans and the legislature challenged the
        college to serve as an innovative, non-traditional liberal arts institution.
        Evergreen&amp;#39;s extraordinary approach to teaching and learning quickly earned the
        college its reputation for innovation and excellence. Today, with higher education growth
        and public funding at a critical turning point, Evergreen is increasing its efforts to
        secure long-term funding sources to ensure the college&amp;#39;s success continues into the
        next generation.</p>
       <p>To that end, the Bill &amp;#38; Melinda Gates Foundation gift will assist Evergreen in
        creating a strong prospect research and stewardship program, aid the college in acquiring
        development training and materials for the Foundation&amp;#39;s Board of Governors and the
        college&amp;#39;s Board of Trustees, and provide seed money for conducting donor cultivation
        activities.</p>
       <p>&amp;quot;We are so very grateful to the Bill &amp;#38; Melinda Gates Foundation for this
        tremendous gift recognizing our work,&amp;quot; said Evergreen President, Thomas L.
        &amp;quot;Les&amp;quot; Purce. &amp;quot;With this initial gift to support a future capital
        campaign, we will be able to engage and inspire our alumni and friends to support the
        long-term success of this extraordinary college,&amp;quot; he said.</p>
       <p>The Bill &amp;#38; Melinda Gates Foundation is dedicated to improving people&amp;#39;s
        lives by sharing advances in health and learning with the global community. Led by Bill
        Gates&amp;#39; father, William H. Gates Sr., and Patty Stonesifer, the Seattle-based
        foundation has an asset base of $24.2 billion.</p>
       <p>The Evergreen State College, a public, four-year college of arts and sciences, annually
        enrolls more than 4,200 students. Evergreen opened its doors in 1971. Since then, it has
        become a national leader in the development of interdisciplinary learning communities that
        combine and coordinate several academic subjects that are traditionally taught
        separately.</p>

       <p>OLYMPIA, Wash. -- The Enduring Legacies Reservation-Based Project, a partnership of The
        Evergreen State College, Grays Harbor College and the Washington State Board for Community
        and Technical Colleges, has received an $800,000 award from Lumina Foundation for Education.
        Lumina Foundation is an Indianapolis-based, private foundation dedicated to expanding access
        and success in education beyond high school.</p>
       <p>The three-year Enduring Legacies Project seeks to increase college access and success for
        reservation-based Native American students through more cohesive degree and transfer
        programs, stronger student support services, and more engaging curriculum provided by an
        innovative multi-institutional and tribal partnership.</p>
       <p>The project partners worked together to establish a hybrid distance learning Associate of
        Arts degree through Grays Harbor College that is fully transferable to four-year colleges.
        The online courses will be offered via WashingtonOnLine (WAOL), which serves community
        college students throughout Washington state. The AA program combines culturally appropriate
        online courses with community-based instruction. Faculty at community colleges throughout
        the state developed the online courses. Among the cooperating institutions that agreed to
        present proprietary courses through Grays Harbor College and WAOL are: North Seattle
        Community College, Skagit Valley College, South Puget Sound Community College and South
        Seattle Community College.</p>
       <p>Upon completion of the AA degree, students may transfer to Evergreen&amp;#8217;s upper
        division Reservation-Based Program, which serves six tribal communities: Makah, Muckleshoot,
        Nisqually, Port Gamble S&amp;#8217;Klallam, Quinault and Skokomish. This BA program features
        a culturally relevant liberal arts curriculum taught on-site in the participating tribal
        communities.</p>
       <p>Evergreen&amp;#8217;s Academic Vice President and Provost, Don Bantz, said he sees great
        potential in the new partnership. &amp;#8220;This could be a prototype for Indian
        education,&amp;#8221; said Bantz. &amp;#8220;It&amp;#8217;s a combination of distance
        learning and high touch learning. Evergreen is grateful to the Lumina Foundation for
        supporting our continuing efforts to develop curriculum and facilitate partnerships among
        the tribes, government agencies and other educational institutions.&amp;#8221;</p>
       <p>The Lumina Foundation grant funds extensive student and faculty support services,
        including a program coordinator and on-site study leaders for the AA program and annual
        faculty development workshops for both the AA and BA programs.</p>
       <p>In addition, the project partners will work in close collaboration with tribal communities
        to develop specific curricular units, or case studies, based on key issues of concern to
        tribes. Case study topic areas to be developed in collaboration with a tribal advisory board
        might include topics such as restoration of natural resources, indigenous research, tribal
        self-governance, education, health, and economic development. Five colleges have agreed to
        field test these case studies: Salish Kootenai College, Northwest Indian College (both
        two-year tribal colleges), Grays Harbor College, Fairhaven College at Western Washington
        University, and Bainbridge Graduate Institute.</p>
       <p>Upon completion, the case studies will initially be used in Evergreen&amp;#8217;s
        undergraduate programs and in the college&amp;#8217;s Master of Public Administration Tribal
        Governance Program.</p>
       <p>Lumina Foundation is one of the many organizations scheduled to participate in a special
        celebration event recognizing the Reservation-Based Transfer Program in Native American
        Studies that is offered through Grays Harbor College and Evergreen. The celebration will
        take place on Tuesday, Sept. 20 at 3 p.m. at the Quinault Beach Resort in Ocean Shores. The
        gathering will honor the program that represents a partnership among several tribes and
        colleges in the state of Washington. The event is open to the public.</p>

       <p>The Evergreen State College will accept as many as 15 students from colleges closed by
        hurricane Katrina and will waive tuition for affected students for at least two quarters.
        Hurricane displaced students will be given consideration on Evergreen&amp;#39;s student
        housing waiting list because residence halls are full.<br/>
        <br/> &amp;quot;We are asking our South Sound neighbors to join us to help those affected by
        the hurricane,&amp;quot; says Thomas L. &amp;quot;Les&amp;quot; Purce, Evergreen&amp;#39;s
        president. &amp;quot;We especially hope to hear from people who can offer housing to any
        students who accept our offer and decide to locate here for school.&amp;quot;<br/>
        <br/> Students affected by hurricane Katrina who are interested in attending Evergreen may
        contact the Office of Admissions, (360) 867-6170, <a href="mailto:admissions@evergreen.edu"
         >admissions@evergreen.edu</a>. &amp;quot;Our primary goal is to assist the institutions
        affected by supporting the academic work of their students until they can return,&amp;quot;
        says President Purce.<br/>
        <br/> The college is also working with emeritus faculty member Maxine Mimms to provide
        support to displaced persons while keeping families together as they arrive at Camp Murray
        in Tacoma. &amp;#160;The Evergreen Tacoma program will work with the Maxine Mimms Academies
        to offer space and technology resources to students at all levels.<br/>
        <br/> In addition to potential new students affected by Katrina, Evergreen has five
        currently enrolled students whose home addresses lie within the federally-declared disaster
        areas as well as ten more from other parts of Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama.
        &amp;#160;The college&amp;#39;s Student Affairs office is contacting each of the students
        and offering assistance.</p>

       <p>&amp;quot;The Washington Center is proud to be part of this incredible outpouring of
        community spirit and support for our neighbors in the south. We know they&amp;#39;d do the
        same for us.&amp;quot; Anne Koglin</p>
       <p>&amp;quot;I sat at home and listened to the inability of our government to respond in a
        meaningful manner. I knew that the only way to help was from the ground up. I knew also that
        I live in a compassionate community with a record of helping those in need. So as a musician
        I threw my tools in the ring and waited for others to follow. The response was inspiring.
        Once again the Olympia community has risen to the occasion.&amp;quot; (Michael Olson
        percussionist with Obrador.)</p>

        through October for promoting reading and building community. The panelists are scholars and
        practitioners in areas that relate to issues in &amp;quot;The Secret Life of Bees&amp;quot;
        such as race, gender and family relations, domestic violence, child protection, and mental
        health.</p>
       <p><strong>The discussion will be at:</strong><br/> The Evergreen State College<br/> Seminar

       <p>OLYMPIA, Wash. -- Hurricane Katrina devastated the Gulf Coast region in August, and
        schools around Washington stepped forward to do their part in assisting displaced students
        from the areas affected by the storm.</p>
       <p>Evergreen enrolled five students whose schools were affected by Katrina. Evergreen also
        committed to waive tuition for these students for at least two quarters.</p>
       <p>&amp;quot;Our primary goal is to assist the schools affected by Katrina through supporting
        the academic work of their students,&amp;quot; says Evergreen President Les Purce. Three of
        the five students returned to New Orleans in late October.</p>
       <p>Aside from Evergreen&amp;#8217;s efforts to support students affected, events supporting
        the relief effort were held. On Sept. 22, President Purce was the master of ceremonies at a
        widely attended benefit performance at Olympia&amp;#8217;s Washington Center for the
        Performing Arts, and in mid-October, Evergreen&amp;#8217;s Master of Public Administration
        Student Union sponsored a panel discussion and forum on public policy surrounding Katrina
        and accepted donations for the American Red Cross.</p>
       <p>The college has five continuing students from the areas affected by the hurricane.
        Evergreen&amp;#8217;s Office of Student Affairs has been in close contact with those
        students as well and is offering assistance as necessary.</p>
       <p>Evergreen received many offers from the community after President Purce&amp;#8217;s
        initial call for community support for the students. Dean of Students and Academic Support
        Services Phyllis Lane was designated to coordinate Evergreen&amp;#8217;s response to
        hurricane issues. Lane acted as a liaison for the students and pursued potential resources
        for the students through the community, FEMA, the Red Cross and Washington&amp;#8217;s
        Department of Social and Health Services.</p>
       <p>111 students affected by the disaster enrolled at Washington public four-year
        institutions. Evergreen and Western matched at six students each for the second-highest
        number of enrolled students, behind UW, according to the Council of Presidents of
        Washington&amp;#8217;s six public four-year schools.</p>

      <body><p>Olympia, Wash. - The Evergreen State College has received an award from the
        Washington Department of Transportation for the Evergreen Parkway road modernization
        project.</p>
       <p>The project is named as a 2005 Outstanding Bicycle and Pedestrian Project for its
        enhancement of bicycle and pedestrian safety. The award was presented to Paul Smith,
        Evergreen&amp;#39;s director of Facilities Services at a November awards luncheon in
        Tacoma.</p>
       <p>The project enhanced traffic and pedestrian safety along a 1.6 mile stretch of roadway on
        Evergreen&amp;#39;s campus. The plan included safety enhancements including a roundabout at
        the main campus entrance, improvements to other intersections, the installation of planter
        strips to separate the pedestrian and bicycle paths from the roadway, and signage
        improvements to enhance the way-finding for all users of the Parkway.</p> The project was
       completed in early September.</body>

       <p>Olympia, Wash. -- Snow already? The Evergreen State College reminds students, faculty,
        staff and the community of procedures to determine the operation status of the college.</p>
       <p>The most effective way to determine whether Evergreen is closed is to call the main campus
        switchboard at (360) 867-6000, option 1 or check the college website at <a
         href="http://www.evergreen.edu/">www.evergreen.edu</a> . The decision to close campus,
        while rare, is made by 6 a.m.</p>
       <p>Evergreen&amp;#39;s primary radio station for emergency information for the Olympia area
        is KGY 1240 AM. Radio stations in Grays Harbor (KXRO 1320), Lewis (KELA 1170), Mason (KMAS
        1030), Pierce (KPLU 88.5) and King Counties (KIRO 710) are also notified, as well as Seattle
        area television stations. For further information about which media outlets are notified,
        contact Anthony Sermonti in the Office of College Relations at <a
         href="mailto:sermonta@evergreen.edu">sermonta@evergreen.edu</a> or call (360) 867-5213.</p>
       <p>Faculty may cancel classes when the college is open. Communication methods for those
        circumstances are arranged within the academic program. With the complex geography and
        dynamic weather in the region, college officials advise individuals to analyze their own
        situation and determine whether it is safe for travel.</p>
       <p>Evergreen&amp;#39;s Tacoma Campus follows the decision of the Tacoma School District.</p>
       <p>The Dean of Evening &amp;#38; Weekend Studies and the vice president of student affairs
        make a decision regarding Evening &amp;#38; Weekend Programs by 3 p.m. on weekdays and by 6
        a.m. on weekends. Information about Evening &amp;#38; Weekend Program closures can also be
        obtained at 867-6000, option 1, or by checking Evergreen&amp;#39;s home page.</p>

       <p>OLYMPIA - The Evergreen State College has been selected to host Fulbright Visiting Scholar
        Dr. Sunil Manilal Kothari from New Delhi, India.</p>
       <p>Kothari is one of approximately 850 foreign faculty and professionals the Fulbright
        Scholar program will bring to the United States this year to teach and perform research.
        Kothari is a dance historian and will lecture about comparative study of Indian Dance and
        dance-drama traditions.</p>
       <p>In 2001 Kothari was awarded the Padma Shri award by the Indian government, recognizing
        distinguished service to the nation. The Padma Shri is the fourth-highest civilian award in
        India.</p>
       <p>The Fulbright program was established in 1946 under legislation by the late Senator
        William Fulbright of Arkansas, and is designed to build mutual understanding between the
        people of the U.S. and other countries. In its 59 years of existence, thousands of U.S.
        faculty and professionals have studied, taught or done research abroad and thousands of
        their counterparts from other countries have engaged in similar activities in the U.S.</p>

       <p>OLYMPIA, Wash. - Findings from a national survey released today show The Evergreen State
        College in Olympia, Wash. is one of the most academically challenging colleges in
        America.</p>
       <p>The alternative college in Olympia, Wash. was also highly rated for active and
        collaborative learning and enriching educational experiences for both first-year students
        and seniors in the National Survey of Student Engagement (NSSE).</p>
       <p>"This survey highlights Evergreen's high academic standards and the remarkable depth of
        engagement that our students experience," said Thomas L. (Les) Purce, president of The
        Evergreen State College.</p>
       <p>The survey is based on information from 237,000 first-year and senior students at 528
        four-year colleges and universities in the United States. The study gives schools and
        students a means to assess student learning and what students receive from their
        undergraduate experience.</p>
       <p>The study notes that Evergreen freshmen and seniors in particular spend more time
        preparing for class, read more textbooks and have a high level of coursework participation
        that involves analyzing basic elements of an idea and synthesizing and organizing ideas into
        more complex interpretation and relationships.</p>
       <p>Evergreen is marked in the top ten-percent of the schools surveyed in the level of
        academic challenge as well as the level of active and collaborative learning among
        first-year students. Evergreen also scored well among senior students in the same
        categories. The study showed that students at Evergreen spend significantly more time
        working in peer groups during class to complete projects. Evergreen students are remarkably
        engaged in their learning and frequently discuss ideas from class work beyond the walls of
        the classroom, the study indicates.</p>
       <p>"Engagement is a critical factor in the educational process because the more time and
        energy students devote to desired activities, the more likely they are to develop the habits
        of the mind that are key to success after college," says George Kuh, NSSE director and
        Indiana Univ. Bloomington professor of higher education. Kuh says engagement is positively
        related to important standards of student success and graduation.</p>
       <p><a href="http://www.carnegiefoundation.org/">The Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement
         of Teaching</a> sponsors the annual NSSE survey for the Advancement of Teaching.</p>
       <p>Founded in 1967 as an alternative to traditional education, The Evergreen State College is
        a top example of interdisciplinary education in America. Academic studies are organized into
        interdisciplinary learning communities focused on specific themes with real-world relevance.
        Evergreen was recently studied as one of twenty colleges in America who are exceptionally
        successful in student engagement and featured in Student Success In College by the American
        Assoc. for Higher Education, 2005.</p>

       <p>SALEM, Ore. -- Evergreen&amp;#39;s men&amp;#39;s soccer team moves to the NAIA Region I
        playoffs after winning Saturday against Corban College of Oregon, 3-1.</p>
       <p>Although conditions at the Corban field were wet and muddy, the Evergreen team pushed
        through the difficult conditions and again showed the depth of their talent with three goals
        by three different players - Gregory Preciado, Trevor Jacka and Jonathan Willoughby.</p>
       <p>Preciado&amp;#39;s goal was scored in the 11th minute, Jacka&amp;#39;s in the 51st, and
        Willoughby&amp;#39;s came six minutes later. Corban&amp;#39;s lone goal was scored in the

       <p><em>Marriage, A Histor</em>y, by Evergreen faculty member Stephanie Coontz has been
        selected as one of the best books of 2005 by the Washington Post.</p>
       <p>The Post cites Coontz's book as one which "neatly, entertainingly and convincingly
        deconstructs a number of our most cherished and least examined beliefs about the bonds that
        tie men and women together, for better and for worse."</p>
       <p>Coontz, a faculty member at Evergreen since 1975, says "marriage today is held up as a
        blissful haven of love and friendship, sex and stability. We long for the gold standard, the
        traditional marriage, but marriage turns out to have a checkered past. This real look at
        what people think of as 'traditional' finally explains why so many people are so anxious
        about marriage."</p>
       <p>Coontz is a nationally known expert on marriage and family. She has appeared numerous
        times on national television, in magazines and national newspapers and is a sought after
        speaker. Marriage, A History is her fifth book - and is published by Viking, New York.</p>

       <p>&amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m excited to take this new role with the chamber. I think it&amp;#39;s

        administrative services at South Puget Sound Community College.</p>
       <p>A resident of the Tumwater area since 1992, he has served as chair of the Tumwater Chamber

        roundabout at the McCann Plaza intersection, make improvements at the other intersections
        and enhance pedestrian and bicycle access to the roadway. The project now goes to the final
        design phase.</p>
       <p>&amp;#8220;This design does the best job of meeting the goals of the project,&amp;#8221;
        Purce said.</p>
       <p>The design option selected addresses the project goals; improving safety for automobiles,
        pedestrians and bicyclists, enhancing intersection safety, lowering future maintenance costs
        and adequately serving present and projected future traffic volumes.</p>
       <p>Purce praised the community feedback gathered at the December 11 neighborhood open house
        and directed that the final design consider suggestions and comments aired at the open
        house. &amp;#8220;The open house was a wonderful opportunity to meet many of our neighbors -
        and we received excellent feedback that will be looked at very closely as we move into the
        final design phase,&amp;#8221; Purce said.</p>
       <p>Requests for proposals from contractors will go out in February, and the project is
        expected to be completed during June of 2005.</p>

       <p>WASHINGTON, D.C. - The Evergreen State College has been named to the list of &amp;quot;Top
        Producing Colleges and Universities&amp;quot; for the Peace Corps.</p>
       <p>Evergreen was listed as 21st in the nation among small colleges and universities for
        alumni involvement in the Peace Corps. The small college and university category includes
        four-year schools with enrollments under 5,000.</p>
       <p>The designation comes as 18 Evergreen graduates are currently serving the citizens of the
        developing world in the Peace Corps.</p>
       <p>In a letter to Evergreen President Thomas L. Purce, Peace Corps Director Gaddi H. Vasquez
        said that Evergreen graduates have made a tremendous contribution to the Peace Corps and the
        world - and the new ranking reflects the high caliber of students who attend The Evergreen
        State College. &amp;quot;The Peace Corps and Evergreen State College have developed a
        significant relationship over the years,&amp;quot; Vasquez says.</p>

        <em>Lakewood contractor awarded $12.7 million contract</em>
       </p>
       <p>The board of trustees of The Evergreen State College has awarded a construction contract
        for the Daniel J. Evans Library modernization project to Pease Construction, Inc. from
        Lakewood, WA. Pease and their subcontractors will arrive on campus prior to March 1, and
        work on the sixteen-month project is expected to begin on that date.</p>
       <p>The $21 million project includes the library, computer, photo, and media areas and other
        spaces of the building.</p>
       <p>The second portion of the building modernization, planned to begin design in mid-2005 if
        state funding is allocated, will focus on the administrative offices, classrooms, and the
        fourth floor. In total, the first portion of the multi-stage plan will shape about half of
        the 330,000 square foot building.</p>
       <p>Also included in the project is the addition of stained-glass artwork inside the building,
        some of which will be visible from the main campus plaza, Red Square.</p>
       <p>College officials are already working to minimize construction impacts for those around
        the construction area - as well as employees who work in the other half of the building. One
        of the first steps was the creation of a communications team to help increase awareness on
        campus about the project and its goals, but also make clear possible impacts or area
        closures.</p>

       <p>The Evergreen chemistry club is also holding a bake sale and fundraiser for survivors of
        the terrible disaster. They will collect donations for the following relief agencies: The
        American Red Cross International Response Fund, Unicef, Oxfam America and the Fort
        Wayne/South Bend Archdiocese specifically for Sri Lankan relief.</p>
       <p>The South Asian tragedy began with the most powerful earthquake in forty years, and was
        followed by a massive tsunami affecting many nations in the region, killing over
        150,000.</p>
       <p align="left">No Evergreen students were studying in the affected area, but Evergreen
        student affairs staff are working with students who had ties to the region. At least one
        Evergreen student appears to have lost a family member.</p>

       <p>The fourth annual Synergy Conference comes to The Evergreen State College campus in early
        February, and organizers say it will integrate themes of agriculture, culture and the arts,
        design, ecology and environmental ethics, social justice, spiritual and physical health and
        more.</p>
       <p>The Synergy Conference is funded and organized by a non-profit coalition of student
        organizations at Evergreen, each focusing on a different facet of sustainable living.</p>
       <p>Similarly, keynote speakers at the conference represent a broad array of sustainability
        fields. Most notably, Amy Goodman, a nationally known radio show host from
        &amp;quot;Democracy Now!&amp;quot; will speak about political justice. For the complete list
        of speakers and their biographies, visit the conference website.</p>
       <p>Workshops and panel discussions on topics ranging from wild food harvesting and
        cultivation to using clean fuels will also be a key part of the conference. A
        &amp;quot;Trashy Fashion&amp;quot; recycled material fashion show; a fire-dancing ritual,
        bike festivities, art shows, as well as conscientious vending promise a festive atmosphere.

       <p>The Evergreen State College Tacoma Campus is hosting an open house from 4-7 p.m. on
        Monday, December 3 to help prospective students chart their course to finishing their
        bachelor&amp;#8217;s degree. Recent community college graduates and mid-career adults who
        have started but not yet finished their bachelor&amp;#8217;s degree are encouraged to
        attend. Staff and faculty will offer information about academic programs, transfer
        opportunities, financial aid, student and alumni experiences, and details related to
        completing a bachelor&amp;#8217;s degree at Evergreen Tacoma. Information sessions will be
        repeated during the course of the event. The college is located at 1210 6th Avenue in
        Tacoma. For more information, visit&amp;#160;<a
         href="site://evergreen.edu/evergreen.edu/tacoma/home"
        >www.evergreen.edu/tacoma</a>&amp;#160;or call 253-680-3000. Winter classes start January
        7.</p>
       <p>Individuals interested in applying for admission or evaluating their academic standing
        should bring an unofficial copy of their college transcripts to the event. Those interested
        in applying for financial aid should bring a copy of their 2006 tax returns.</p>
       <p>Prospective students who can&amp;#8217;t attend the December 3 open house can take part in
        one of the weekly information sessions offered either Wednesdays at 10 a.m. and 11 a.m. and
        Thursdays at 5 p.m. and 6 p.m.</p>
       <p>The Evergreen State College&amp;#8217;s Tacoma Campus offers upper division courses for
        students ready to begin their junior or senior year. Evergreen offers up to two years of
        transfer credit for graduates of Washington community and technical colleges. Students can
        earn a bachelor arts degree with emphases in such areas as Social &amp;#38; Human Services,
        Law, Justice &amp;#38; Public Policy, Education, Outreach, Public Health, Environmental
        Studies and Cultural &amp;#38; Media Studies.</p>
       <p>&amp;quot;Many students have accumulated college credits over the years, sometimes from
        several sources, but they haven&amp;#8217;t managed to complete their degree,&amp;quot;
        explained Evergreen Tacoma Executive Director Artee Young, PhD, JD. &amp;quot;We will have
        admissions staff on hand to help people with the application and transfer process and learn
        more about how Evergreen Tacoma can help them reach their goals. Many times people are much
        closer to finishing than they think &amp;#8211; especially given the flexibility of
        Evergreen&amp;#8217;s academic model &amp;#8211; but they&amp;#8217;ve been putting it off
        waiting for a better time. We tell them it&amp;#8217;s best just to get started because
        there will never be a perfect time. If you don&amp;#8217;t start, you can&amp;#8217;t
        finish.&amp;quot;</p>

       <h3><a href="site://evergreen.edu/evergreen.edu/commute/home">Greener Commute Program</a>
        Challenges Student, Faculty and Staff to Explore Alternative Commuting</h3>
       <p>The <a href="http://www.evergreen.edu/commute/">Greener Commuting Event</a> encourages
        students, faculty and staff to make a habit of alternative commuting.&amp;#160;&amp;#160; It
        is being led by the Greener Commute Program, formerly known as Commute Trip Reduction. The
        event runs from November 5 to November 16 and is part of Evergreen&amp;#8217;s commitment to
        raise awareness about global warming and reduce the college&amp;#8217;s carbon footprint.
        &amp;#160;</p>
       <p>Event features include the following:</p>
       <ul>
        <li><strong>CARPOOLS PARK FREE</strong><br/> Carpool groups of three or more can stop by the
         McCann Plaza Parking Booth to receive a carpool day pass at no charge. Bring expired
         carpool passes to the Greener Commuting tent on Red Square to enter a prize drawing.</li>
        <li><strong>RED SQUARE RIDE BOARD</strong><br/> Stop by our Red Square ride board to connect
         with Greeners who are willing to ride-share. The ride board will be available daily
         November 5 to November 16 on Red Square near the library building entrance.</li>
        <li><strong>FREE REFLECTIVE ANKLE/ARM-BAND: RED SQUARE</strong><br/> The first few dozen
         bicyclists or walkers to stop by the Greener Commuting tent on Red Square next week can
         receive a free LED arm band. These armbands are a must for all bicyclists and walkers as
         the winter days shorten.&amp;#160;</li>
        <li><strong>BIKE HELMETS: $4 on RED SQUARE</strong><br/> Thanks to a grant by the Thurston
         County Surface Transportation Program, the Greener Commute Program will be able to offer
         bike helmets at a very low cost to our community. This is a great opportunity to stay safe
         at a low cost.&amp;#160; Medium and large size helmets are available while they last.</li>
        <li><strong>ENTER TO WIN AWESOME PRIZES</strong><br/> Carpoolers and commuters who take our
         survey can enter to win prizes from dozens of local businesses, like a $50 gift certificate
         to Traditions Cafe or Ice Cream from Baskin Robbins. Just bring expired carpool day-passes
         or fill out a survey and enter to win.</li>
        <li><strong>FREE &amp;#39;SHARE THE ROAD&amp;#39; LICENSE PLATE EMBLEM</strong><br/>
         Evergreen students are invited to pick up Share the Road license plate emblems, offered
         free by the Greener Commuting Program while supplies last.&amp;#160;&amp;#160;</li>

       <h4>Why Alternative Commuting?</h4>
       <p>Evergreen&amp;#8217;s rural location means that students, staff, and faculty need to
        travel further distances to get to campus.&amp;#160; As a result, 24 percent of all of
        Evergreen&amp;#8217;s greenhouse gases are emitted by commuters.&amp;#160;&amp;#160;
        Alternative commuting is an excellent strategy to save energy and reduce climate-changing
        emissions.</p>

       <p>The Evergreen community suffered a significant loss in July when faculty member doranne
        crable died. Her friends and relatives respect her wishes not to have a formal memorial on
        campus but also realize that our community needs to honor her passing and her life. The
        community will celebrate doranne&amp;#39;s life together at Olympia&amp;#39;s Capitol
        Theater on November 17 at a screening of a very special film, Gypsy Caravan, which documents
        the music and spirit of a group of people from countries that doranne had been to or planned
        to visit in her never-ending quest for new experiences and knowledge. The film&amp;#39;s
        director had originally titled the film, When the road bends: tales of a gypsy caravan,
        which is derived from the Romani proverb about how to cope when life doesn&amp;#39;t deal
        you a straight hand. doranne had been looking forward to teaching in The Gypsy Road: A Study
        of the Roma this fall and was surrounded by books, music, and images as she prepared for her
        class during her treatments for lung cancer. Everyone will have the opportunity to share her
        love of dance, song, a passionate story, and a good laugh as they watch this film
        together.</p>
       <p>Members of the community are asked to please reserve the afternoon of Saturday, November
        17, 2007 beginning at noon for the Olympia premiere of Gypsy Caravan.&amp;#160;&amp;#160;
        The film will be shown at Capitol Theater at 206 5th Avenue S.E. and will be followed by a
        reception hosted by doranne&amp;#39;s family from 2:30 p.m. to 4:30 p.m. at the Heritage
        Room at 604 Water Street, next to the Water Street Caf&amp;#233;.</p>

       <p>The Geoduck women&amp;#39;s soccer team looks strong this fall with a pre-season #2 rating
        in the Cascade Conference polls and a #5 ranking in the NAIA Region I. Evergreen fall sports
        teams return with talented and experienced athletes in addition to the new Geoducks on
        campus, plus two head coaching changes in women&amp;#39;s soccer and volleyball.</p>
       <p>The women&amp;#39;s soccer team headlines the Geoduck sports show. Head coach John
        Purtteman has a strong returning class in his first year at the helm. Add a talented group
        of newcomers to the roster and this season&amp;#39;s team will be fun to watch. Midfielder
        Jenine Adam (&amp;#39;06 All-Conference/All-Region honors) and defender Marissa Major
        (&amp;#39;06 All-Conference honors) are the standout returners. Look for newcomers Tivoli
        Farler of Olympia (midfielder) and Katie Cagle of Estacada, Ore. (keeper) to make an
        immediate impact.</p>
       <p>This weekend the women open their season on the road against the University of British
        Columbia on August 24, and Simon Fraser University on the 25th. Their home openers will be
        Sept. 1, against Thompson Rivers University and Sept. 2 vs. Pacific Lutheran University in
        Evergreen&amp;#39;s Arno Zoske Tournament.</p>
       <p>Coach Purtteman is confident that the men&amp;#39;s soccer team will fare better than the
        team&amp;#39;s 7th poll position. James Pratt, All-Conference honoree and one of the
        team&amp;#39;s top scorers in &amp;#39;06, leads the eight returners. Senior Matt Curry has
        strong attacking experience on the front line. Josh Hacker and Jesse Wheelock, both
        midfielders, are top new additions to the team.</p>
       <p>The men opened their season August 20 with a 5-1 home win over the University of Great
        Falls. They take on The University of British Columbia Sept. 1 and Simon Fraser University
        Sept. 2 at home in Evergreen&amp;#39;s Arno Zoske Tournament.</p>
       <p>In harrier action, the women&amp;#39;s cross country team has more depth than any time in
        its history. Their pre-season 8th place conference ranking may not be reflective of this
        team&amp;#39;s potential, according to head coach Craig Dickson. Leading returners include
        Emily Uhlig (18th at &amp;#39;06 conference championships) and Kelly Beckham (19th at
        &amp;#39;06 conference championships). Two transfers from NCAA Division I programs join the
        team in &amp;#39;07. Ana Casillas of Puyallup (Bellarmine Prep HS) and Ariel Taylor of
        Olympia (Capital HS) will bring additional experience and talent to the Geoducks. Casillas
        and Taylor previously attended Montana State and E. Washington University respectively.</p>
       <p>With only one &amp;#39;06 team member lost to graduation, the &amp;#39;07 men&amp;#39;s
        cross country team will benefit from experienced veterans. Like the women, the men ranked
        8th in pre-season polling. Senior James Hudson (18th at &amp;#39;06 conference
        championships) and sophomore Brian Rakestraw (14th at &amp;#39;06 conference championships)
        have promising seasons ahead. Chris Johnson of Sumner High School will join the team as the
        top freshman.</p>
       <p>Both the women&amp;#39;s and men&amp;#39;s cross country teams will open their season
        September 7 at the Northwest University Invitational in Seattle.</p>
       <p>Clay Blackwood is in the process of rebuilding the Geoduck volleyball team. As the
        recently hired Evergreen head coach, his goal is to put together the best team possible by
        their September 7 home opener against Corban College. Senior Madeline Blevens and sophomore
        Kandice Gleaves return as the 3rd and 2nd best point scorers respectively. Lauren Allen,
        Erin Caldwell and Alysse Eaton round out the top returners.</p>

       <h2>Evergreen Tacoma Campus Open House<br/> Offers Guidance for Completing
        Bachelor&amp;#8217;s Degree</h2>
       <p>(Tacoma, Wash.) The Evergreen State College Tacoma Campus is hosting an <strong>open house
         from 4-7 p.m. on Wednesday, September 12</strong> to help prospective students chart their
        course to finishing their bachelor&amp;#8217;s degree.<span>&amp;#160;</span> Recent
        community college graduates and mid-career adults who have started but not yet finished
        their bachelor&amp;#8217;s degree are encouraged to attend.</p>
       <p>Staff and faculty will offer information about academic programs, transfer opportunities,
        financial aid, student and alumni experiences, and details related to completing a
        bachelor&amp;#8217;s degree at Evergreen Tacoma.<span>&amp;#160;</span> There will be an
        introductory session at 4:30 p.m. and additional information sessions will repeat during the
        course of the event.<span>&amp;#160;</span> The college is located at 1210 6th Avenue in
         Tacoma.<span>&amp;#160;</span>
        <strong>For more information, visit <a href="http://www.evergreen.edu/tacoma"
          >www.evergreen.edu/tacoma</a> or call 253-680-3000</strong>.<span>&amp;#160;</span> Fall
        classes start September 24.</p>
       <p>Prospective students who would like to have their transfer credit reviewed should bring an
        unofficial copy of their prior transcripts. Those who want an evaluation of their financial
        aid potential should bring a copy of their 2006 income tax forms.</p>
       <p>Individuals who cannot attend the open house on September 12 can take advantage of weekly
        information sessions for prospective students offered on Tuesdays at 5 p.m. and 6 p.m. and
        Wednesdays at 10 a.m. and 11 a.m.</p>
       <p>The Evergreen State College&amp;#8217;s Tacoma Campus offers upper division courses for
        students ready to begin their junior or senior year.<span>&amp;#160;</span> Evergreen offers
        up to two years of transfer credit for graduates of Washington community and technical
         colleges.<span>&amp;#160;</span> Students can earn a Bachelor of Arts degree with an area
        of emphasis in a wide range of fields.</p>
       <p>&amp;#8220;Many students have accumulated college credits over the years, sometimes from
        several sources, but they haven&amp;#8217;t managed to complete their degree,&amp;#8221;
        explained Evergreen Tacoma executive director Artee Young, PhD. &amp;#8220;We will have
        admissions staff on hand to help people with the application and transfer process and learn
        more about how Evergreen Tacoma can help them reach their goals.<span>&amp;#160;</span> Many
        times people are much closer to finishing than they think &amp;#8211; especially given the
        flexibility of Evergreen&amp;#8217;s academic model &amp;#8211; but they&amp;#8217;ve been
        putting it off waiting for a better time. We tell them it&amp;#8217;s best just to get
        started because there will never be a perfect time.<span>&amp;#160;</span> If you
        don&amp;#8217;t start, you can&amp;#8217;t finish.&amp;#8221;</p>

       <p>(Tacoma, Wash.) The Evergreen State College Tacoma Campus is hosting an <strong>open house
         from 4-7 p.m. on Wednesday, August 15</strong> to help prospective students chart their
        course to finishing their bachelor&amp;#8217;s degree.<span>&amp;#160;</span> Recent
        community college graduates and mid-career adults who have started but not yet finished
        their bachelor&amp;#8217;s degree are encouraged to attend.</p>
       <p>Staff and faculty will offer information about academic programs, transfer opportunities,
        financial aid, student and alumni experiences, and details related to completing a
        bachelor&amp;#8217;s degree at Evergreen Tacoma.<span>&amp;#160;</span> There will be an
        introductory session at 4:30 p.m. and additional information sessions will repeat during the
        course of the event.<span>&amp;#160;</span> The college is located at 1210 6th Avenue in
         Tacoma.<span>&amp;#160;</span> For more information, visit <a
         href="http://www.evergreen.edu/tacoma">www.evergreen.edu/tacoma</a> or call
         253-680-3000.<span>&amp;#160;</span> Fall classes start September 24.</p>
       <p><strong>For those who can&amp;#8217;t attend August 15, there will be a second open house
         on September 12 with the same schedule and content.<span>&amp;#160;</span></strong>
        Prospective students can also attend weekly information sessions offered on Tuesdays at 5
        p.m. and 6 p.m. and Wednesdays at 10 a.m. and 11 a.m.</p>
       <p>The Evergreen State College&amp;#8217;s Tacoma Campus offers upper division courses for
        students ready to begin their junior or senior year.<span>&amp;#160;</span> Evergreen offers
        up to two years of transfer credit for graduates of Washington community and technical
         colleges.<span>&amp;#160;</span> Students can earn a Bachelor of Arts degree with an area
        of emphasis in a wide range of fields.</p>
       <p>&amp;#8220;Many students have accumulated college credits over the years, sometimes from
        several sources, but they haven&amp;#8217;t managed to complete their degree,&amp;#8221;
        explained Evergreen Tacoma executive director Artee Young, PhD. &amp;#8220;We will have
        admissions staff on hand to help people with the application and transfer process and learn
        more about how Evergreen Tacoma can help them reach their goals.<span>&amp;#160;</span> Many
        times people are much closer to finishing than they think &amp;#8211; especially given the
        flexibility of Evergreen&amp;#8217;s academic model &amp;#8211; but they&amp;#8217;ve been
        putting it off waiting for a better time. We tell them it&amp;#8217;s best just to get
        started because there will never be a perfect time.<span>&amp;#160;</span> If you
        don&amp;#8217;t start, you can&amp;#8217;t finish.&amp;#8221;</p>

        <span>The Princeton Review has named KAOS 89.3 FM, Evergreen&amp;#8217;s community radio
         station, one of the top 15 college radio stations in the nation. Since going on the air in
         1973, the station has continued to gain popularity both on and off campus through its
         eclectic blend of music, commentary and public service. &amp;#8220;Finding KAOS listed
         among so many larger stations, with many located in much larger population centers, is
         certainly an unexpected honor,&amp;#8221; said Jerry Drummond, KAOS general manager.
         &amp;#8220;As a major portion of the audience we strive to serve, it is gratifying to have
         the students of The Evergreen State College designate KAOS as worthy of this
         ranking.&amp;#8221;</span>

       <p>The Evergreen State College will use exclusively cage-free eggs at its campus dining
        facilities, a move that The Humane Society of the United States (HSUS) praised as an
        important step for animal welfare.Evergreen&amp;#39;s Dining Services has chosen to
        completely eliminate the use of eggs from caged birds from its dining facilities, including
        The Greenery , The Market , The Corner Store and Seminar II Caf&amp;#233;. The college uses
        more than 2,000 pounds of liquid cage-free eggs and almost 10,000 shelled cage-free eggs per
        year.</p>
       <p>Aramark&amp;#39;s Craig Ward, director of Dining Services says
        &amp;quot;Evergreen&amp;#39;s dining services goal is to support the mission of the college
        while promoting the well-being and social responsibility of our campus community. We
        continually strive to meet the needs of our socially-conscious student body by providing
        organic, pesticide-free, and local foods. Making the change to cage-free eggs aligns with
        the goals of our entire campus community and is just one of many steps we have taken towards
        realizing a more sustainable dining services operation. Aramark Corp. is the provider of
        campus food service. The Evergreen State College joins Cornish College of the Arts, Seattle
        University and Whitman College in enacting a policy to eliminate or greatly reduce the use
        of eggs from caged hens. Across the country, more than 100 colleges and universities have
        done the same, including University of Wisconsin-Madison, Berkeley, Stanford, Princeton and Yale.<br/>
        <br/> &amp;quot;The Evergreen State College has taken a positive step for animal welfare by
        ending its use of eggs from caged birds,&amp;quot; commented Paul Shapiro, Factory Farming
        Campaign director for The HSUS. Several major grocery chains have also implemented similar
        policies.<br/>

       <p>Julie Congdon, a regional recruiter with the Peace Corps will visit The Evergreen State
        College Wednesday, Jan. 31 from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. in the Dean&amp;#39;s conference room,
        Library 3205. She will be available to talk with students and answer questions.<br/>
        <br/> In 2006, Evergreen was marked as 11th in the nation among universities with enrollment
        under 5,000 for the level of alumni involvement in the Peace Corps. Approximately 20
        Evergreen alumni currently serve around the world.<br/>
        <br/> In a February, 2006 letter to Evergreen President Thomas L. &amp;quot;Les&amp;quot;
        Purce, Gaddi H. Vasquez, the former director of the Peace Corps, said &amp;#8220;throughout
        the years, your school has made a tremendous contribution to this agency&amp;#39;s global
        legacy of public service. Your students are making important contributions to grass-roots
        projects in agriculture, education, the environment, health and HIV/AIDS education and
        prevention, small business development and youth development.&amp;#8221;<br/>
        <br/> The Peace Corps, an independent federal agency, was established in 1961 by President
        Kennedy. Since that time, more than 182,000 citizens have served in the Peace Corps in 76 countries.<br/>

       <p>The Evergreen State College has recently added an Internet-based system called FlashAlert
        for disseminating college closure or other emergency information.<br/>
        <br/> At the same time the information is transmitted to the news media, you can get the
        same emergency messages from the college delivered directly to your e-mail, or as a cell
        phone text message by signing up.<br/>
        <br/> To register, go to <a href="http://www.flashalert.net/news.html?id=1295"
         >http://www.flashalert.net/news.html?id=1295</a> and click the 'subscribe' button. The
        following page will allow you to add up to five e-mail or cell phone addresses to receive
        emergency information. When you are done, click "Update Email Addresses and Send Test
        Messages." A verification message will be sent to each of your listed addresses.<br/>
        <br/> It's important to note that with the proliferation of spam -- and the resulting spam
        filters, it is impossible to completely guarantee message delivery to your inbox, since
        filters sometime block authentic messages. After adding or changing email addresses, have
        test messages sent to verify they will pass through e-mail server filters.<br/>
        <br/> All addresses registered on the FlashAlert system will remain confidential and will
        not be released to any person or organization. Once a year, you will receive an email at
        your primary address asking if you wish to continue your subscription. For general
        information about the new system, go to www.flashalert.net.<br/>
        <br/> Please remember that emergency information will continue to be available at:</p>
       <ul>
        <li>The campus Web site - <a href="http://www.evergreen.edu">www.evergreen.edu</a></li>
        <li>The recorded campus status message - available by calling 867-6000, selecting option

        Hall at 8 p.m. Feb. 9 as part of the Evergreen Expressions concert series.<br/>
        <br/> Tickets are on sale now at the Evergreen Bookstore, buyolympia.com and Rainy Day
        Records in Olympia. Prices are $10 for general admission and $5 for students and senior
        citizens. Credit card phone orders can be placed by calling the college&amp;#8217;s Box
        Office at 867-6833.<br/>
        <br/> Fine Times tells the autobiographical story of an Irish-American young man in 1970 who
        escapes the confusion and strife of the inner-city by journeying into the mountains of West
        Virginia where he discovers a vibrant and sustaining culture of storytelling and music. This
        back-to-the-land odyssey is complete with tales about raccoon-hunting monkeys, runaway
        horses, and three legged chickens. And a crackerjack ghost story sure to make you jump. The
        performance will be followed by a reception and art show featuring original watercolor
        paintings by Paula Blasius-McHugh.<br/>

       <p>The level of alumni involvement in the Peace Corps has again landed The Evergreen State
        College the distinction as one of the corps top-25 schools in the nation.<br/>
        <br/> With 17 students working abroad as Peace Corps volunteers, Evergreen is ranked 18th
        among the nation&amp;#39;s colleges and universities with less than 5,000 undergraduate
        students. Ron Tschetter, Director of the Peace Corps said &amp;quot;the Peace Corps presents
        the face of America to people around the world, and our success is directly attributable to
        the outstanding support we receive from The Evergreen State College.&amp;quot;<br/>
        <br/> With the broad range of study abroad options and the values that the college places on
        public service, Evergreen President Thomas L. (Les) Purce says &amp;quot;our alumni
        involvement with the Peace Corps continues to be impressive &amp;#8212; it&amp;#39;s a
        testament to the commitment we place on learning across differences and preparing our
        students to effect positive change.&amp;quot;<br/>
        <br/> Program wide, more than 7,700 volunteers currently serve at 67 posts in 73 countries.
        A new program in Ethiopia will focus on HIV/AIDS, and for the first time, volunteers will
        serve in Cambodia, according to the Peace Corps. The independent federal program was founded
        by President John F. Kennedy in 1961. Since that time, more than 187,000 have served.<br/>

       <p>Robin Blaser, a well known Canadian poet will give a talk at The Evergreen State College
        Monday, Feb. 5 at 7 p.m. in the Seminar II Building, room A 1105. Blaser has developed as a
        writer through subsequent generations and poetic movements, and his work now extends beyond
        the era in which it began. An immigrant to Vancouver, B.C. in 1966, and a Canadian citizen
        since 1972, Blaser has established himself as a key figure on the west coast of B.C. and an
        important influence among Canadian experimental poets such as George Bowering, Steve
        McCaffery, bp Nichol, Erin Moure, and Daphne Marlatt.</p>
       <p>In 2000, he published a libretto for The Last Supper, an opera with music by British
        composer Sir Harrison Birtwistle. Currently, he is completing Collected Essays and an
        expanded edition of The Holy Forest that will include a new book of poems. Other recent
        titles include Wanders (2002) and The Irreperable (2003). In addition, Blaser has published
        numerous essays on poetics, including &amp;quot;The Fire,&amp;#8221; which was anthologized
        in The Poetics of the New American Poetry (1974), and &amp;quot;The Practice of
        Outside,&amp;#8221; which accompanies his edition of The Collected Books of Jack Spicer
        (1980). Blaser&amp;#8217;s appearance is free and open to the public. Campus parking is
        $1.25. For more information, call 867-5412.</p>

       <p>Foundation Activity Grants are offered by The Evergreen State College Foundation Board of
        Governors and administered by the Provost&amp;#39;s Academic Grants office. The program
        supports the projects of individual students, student teams, and student-faculty teams.<br/>
        <br/> Activity Grant projects are usually carried out in conjunction with academic programs
        and all projects must have at least one faculty sponsor.<br/>
        <br/> Academic Grants staff will offer a workshop with tips for writing Activity Grant
        proposals on Thursday, Jan. 11 and again on Tuesday, Jan. 16. Both sessions are from 4:30 to
        6 p.m. in Seminar II B1107.<br/>
        <br/> From the program&amp;#39;s inception, it has supported a variety of efforts, including
        theatrical productions, art projects and exhibitions, scientific research, video and film
        productions, implementation of sustainable agricultural practices, student literary
        magazines and expenses for students to attend professional conferences and present their work.<br/>
        <br/> Recently, the Board of Governors approved changes to the Activity Grant program and
        nearly doubled its annual funding for 2006-07, to a total of $20,000. The board also raised
        the maximum award per student to $1,000 and made adjustments to the selection criteria. The
        Foundation can award about 7 to 10 students each fall, winter and spring quarter, so
        considerable competition is expected. Activity grant funding is provided by private giving
        to the college.<br/>

       <p>Renowned author, poet and literary legend Maya Angelou drew more than three thousand
        people to Evergreen&amp;#39;s College Recreation Center gym in February, urging those in the
        audience to be &amp;#39;rainbows in the clouds.&amp;#39; The standing-room only crowd
        hailing from around the region gave Angelou a standing ovation as she delivered her
        remarks.Angelou&amp;#39;s visit to Evergreen was her first, and one of the college&amp;#39;s
        largest-ever speaking events.</p>
       <p>Angelou is known for the autobiographical writings <em>I Know Why the Caged Bird
         Sings</em> (1969) and <em>All God&amp;#39;s Children Need Traveling Shoes</em> (1986). In
        1993, Angelou read her poem &amp;quot;On the Pulse of Morning&amp;quot; during the
        inauguration ceremony for President Clinton. In 2001, she was named as one of the thirty
        most powerful women in America.</p>
       <p>Angelou&amp;#39;s talk began as a sometimes humorous, sometimes striking conversation
        ranging from her observations from history to the need to honor those who have paid the
        price for civil rights and liberties. Among the thousands of people in attendance from as
        far away as Bellingham and Portland, Ore., Keith Logan from Kirkland said &amp;quot;her work
        is very important and the chance to see her comes maybe once every few years, if at
        all.&amp;quot;</p>

       <h2>A Brave and Startling Truth</h2>
       <h3>by Maya Angelou</h3>
       <p>We, this people, on a small and lonely planet Traveling through casual space Past aloof
        stars, across the way of indifferent suns<br/> To a destination where all signs tell us<br/>
        It is possible and imperative that we learn<br/> A brave and startling truth<br/>
        <br/> And when we come to it<br/> To the day of peacemaking<br/> When we release our
        fingers<br/> From fists of hostility<br/> And allow the pure air to cool our palms<br/>
        <br/> When we come to it<br/> When the curtain falls on the minstrel show of hate<br/> And
        faces sooted with scorn are scrubbed clean<br/> When battlefields and coliseum<br/> No
        longer rake our unique and particular sons and daughters<br/> Up with the bruised and bloody
        grass<br/> To lie in identical plots in foreign soil<br/>
        <br/> When the rapacious storming of the churches<br/> The screaming racket in the temples
        have ceased<br/> When the pennants are waving gaily<br/> When the banners of the world
        tremble<br/> Stoutly in the good, clean breeze<br/>
        <br/> When we come to it<br/> When we let the rifles fall from our shoulders<br/> And
        children dress their dolls in flags of truce<br/> When land mines of death have been
        removed<br/> And the aged can walk into evenings of peace<br/> When religious ritual is not
        perfumed<br/> By the incense of burning flesh<br/> And childhood dreams are not kicked
        awake<br/> By nightmares of abuse<br/>
        <br/> When we come to it<br/> Then we will confess that not the Pyramids<br/> With their
        stones set in mysterious perfection<br/> Nor the Gardens of Babylon<br/> Hanging as eternal
        beauty<br/> In our collective memory<br/> Not the Grand Canyon<br/> Kindled into delicious
        color<br/> By Western sunsets<br/>
        <br/> Nor the Danube, flowing its blue soul into Europe<br/> Not the sacred peak of Mount
        Fuji<br/> Stretching to the Rising Sun<br/> Neither Father Amazon nor Mother Mississippi
        who, without favor,<br/> Nurture all creatures in the depths and on the shores<br/> These
        are not the only wonders of the world<br/>
        <br/> When we come to it<br/> We, this people, on this minuscule and kithless globe<br/> Who
        reach daily for the bomb, the blade and the dagger<br/> Yet who petition in the dark for
        tokens of peace<br/> We, this people on this mote of matter<br/> In whose mouths abide
        cankerous words<br/> Which challenge our very existence<br/> Yet out of those same
        mouths<br/> Come songs of such exquisite sweetness<br/> That the heart falters in its
        labor<br/> And the body is quieted into awe<br/>
        <br/> We, this people, on this small and drifting planet<br/> Whose hands can strike with
        such abandon<br/> That in a twinkling, life is sapped from the living<br/> Yet those same
        hands can touch with such healing, irresistible tenderness<br/> That the haughty neck is
        happy to bow<br/> And the proud back is glad to bend<br/> Out of such chaos, of such
        contradiction<br/> We learn that we are neither devils nor divines<br/>
        <br/> When we come to it<br/> We, this people, on this wayward, floating body<br/> Created
        on this earth, of this earth<br/> Have the power to fashion for this earth<br/> A climate
        where every man and every woman<br/> Can live freely without sanctimonious piety<br/>
        Without crippling fear<br/>
        <br/> When we come to it<br/> We must confess that we are the possible<br/> We are the
        miraculous, the true wonder of this world<br/> That is when, and only when<br/> We come to
        it.<br/>
       </p>

       <p>Fryer oil containing trans fats will no longer be used by Campus Dining Services at The
        Evergreen State College, the provider of campus food service announced today. A type of
        unsaturated fat, trans fatty acids are not required or beneficial for human health, and
        consumption increases the risk of coronary heart disease, according to the American Heart
        Association.</p>
       <p>Aramark Corp., the contractual provider of campus food service, has converted to a zero
        grams trans fat fryer oil, defined by the Food and Drug Administration as 0.5 grams per
        serving or less, at all its dining locations on campus. Aramark says their research shows
        consumers are more concerned than ever with their intake of trans fats.</p>
       <p>&amp;#8220;Aramark is committed to identifying and providing a wide range of choices to
        help our clients and customers manage their consumption of trans fats and saturated
        fats,&amp;#8221; said Craig J. Ward, director of Campus Dining Services. &amp;#8220;After an
        in-depth product review, it&amp;#8217;s clear that this new oil offers the best combination
        of value, performance, taste delivery and health profile.&amp;#8221; According to 2006
        Aramark research, 27% of American adults feel strongly about limiting their trans fats
        intake in meals purchased away-from-home, up from an average of 21% in 2005. The research, a
        comprehensive, nationwide study of the away-from-home eating habits, nutritional preferences
        and perceptions of Americans, is conducted each year to better understand consumer
        preferences and tailor dining programs to fit consumer needs.</p>

       <p>The office of College Relations and department of Police Services are working together to
        inform and educate all campus community members how to be safer drivers, bikers and
        pedestrians. From posters, safety talks and radio spots on KAOS Radio, to traffic safety
        patrols on and around campus roadways, this campaign involves everyone in making Evergreen a
        safer campus.</p>
       <p><strong>Bicyclists:</strong><br/> Be seen and follow the law! Most fatal bicycle accidents
        occur between 3 pm. and 6 p.m. Brush up on bicycle traffic laws by stopping at Police
        Services for a brochure, or go to http://www.wsdot.wa.gov/bike/Laws.htm.</p>
       <p><strong>Pedestrians:</strong><br/> Walk safely! Always walk on the sidewalk. If there is
        no sidewalk and you have to walk in the road, always walk facing traffic, so you can see any
        car that might go out of control. Dress to be seen. Brightly colored clothing makes it
        easier for drivers to see you during the daytime. At night, be sure to wear special
        reflective material on your shoes, cap or jacket to reflect the headlights of cars coming
        towards you.</p>
       <p><strong>Drivers: Slow down!</strong><br/> Speeding is one of the most prevalent factors
        contributing to traffic crashes. The Highway Traffic Safety Administration estimates the
        economic cost to society of speeding-related crashes to be $40.4 billion per year. In 2004,
        13,192 people died in speeding-related crashes. Most speeding-related fatalities occur on
        roadways where the speed limit is under 55 mph.</p>

       <p>John &amp;quot;Jack&amp;quot; Longino &amp;#8211; a faculty member at The Evergreen State
        College and a nationally known expert on insects &amp;#8211; has been awarded a five-year,
        $649,371 grant from the <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/index.jsp">National Science
         Foundation</a>. As principal investigator, Longino will lead a study to find new insect
        species and to explore the possible effects of global warming on insect diversity.</p>
       <p>&amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m elated,&amp;quot; Longino said from a research station in Costa
        Rica. &amp;quot;This important work will help us understand the basic cataloging of life.
        Each of these new species is like an unread book.&amp;quot;</p>
       <p>While he admits ants aren&amp;#39;t necessarily everyone&amp;#39;s thing,
        Longino&amp;#39;s work has broad meaning &amp;#8211; from global warming to farming.
        &amp;quot;Ants are really cool,&amp;quot; Longino says. &amp;quot;You just look in their
        little beady eyes... they&amp;#39;re everywhere.&amp;quot; In the past 20 years, Longino has
        discovered more than 30 new species of ants and was awarded the prestigious <a
         href="http://www.evergreen.edu/news/releases/july06/zoologist.htm">E.O. Wilson Naturalist
         Award</a> by the American Society of Naturalists in June 2006.</p>
       <p>Ants, like many species around the world from insects to mammals, have specially adapted
        to particular climate zones, particularly in the tropics. Global warming threatens to push
        temperatures up in those different zones. &amp;quot;Think of the climate zones from the
        ocean shoreline to Mt. Rainier,&amp;quot; Longino says. &amp;quot;The lower climate zones
        will get warmer, and so will the mountaintops.&amp;quot; Many species wouldn&amp;#39;t
        survive those temperature changes.</p>
       <p>&amp;quot;This work is trying to identify the scope of global warming,&amp;quot; he
        explains. &amp;quot;We can either ameliorate some fears, or really realize what
        we&amp;#39;ll lose. This may give us all a little extra push to do something about
        it.&amp;quot;</p>
       <p>Understanding and finding new species of ants also has impact on agriculture and farming.
        According to the U.S. Dept. of Agriculture, fire ants alone cost more than $5 billion each
        year to control. &amp;quot;Farmers need to know what this new pest ant is that&amp;#39;s
        crawling around,&amp;quot; says Longino.</p>
       <p>After the first year of the project, Longino will annually select four Evergreen
        undergraduates to travel to the host country during spring quarter and participate in field
        and laboratory work. An undergraduate lab assistant will support the project in Olympia.
        &amp;quot;So much science these days is done in front of a computer &amp;#8211; it&amp;#39;s
        important for students to get out, get excited, and see these things,&amp;quot; Longino
        says. &amp;quot;It will be life changing for them &amp;#8211; they&amp;#39;ll be out in the
        mud and mosquitoes for 8 weeks, but being excited is what motivates.&amp;quot;</p>

        student-faculty teams. Last summer the board of governors (BOG) approved changes to the
        activity grant program and nearly doubled its annual funding for 2006-07, to a total of
        $20,000. The BOG also raised the maximum award per student to $1,000 and made adjustments to
        the selection criteria. The Foundation can award about 7 to 10 students each fall, winter
        and spring quarter. We expect considerable competition for these awards. Activity Grant
        projects are usually carried out in conjunction with academic programs and all projects must
        have at least one faculty sponsor.</p>
       <p>The program has supported a variety of efforts, including theatrical productions, art
        projects and exhibitions, scientific research, video and film productions, implementation of
        sustainable agricultural practices, student literary magazines, and expenses for students to
        attend professional conferences to present their work. To apply Submit a complete
        application by 5 p.m. on Friday, April 13 to the Academic Grants office, Library 3125.
        Applications that are incomplete or that are submitted after 5 p.m. on April 13 will not be
        considered. For detailed information on the application process and materials, go to

       <p>Diet for a Small Planet author explores keys to strong democracy Best-selling author and
        social change activist Frances Moore Lapp&amp;#233; will speak at The Evergreen State
        College as a part of the Willi Unsoeld Seminar Series at 8 p.m. on Tuesday, April 17 in the
        college&amp;#8217;s Longhouse Center. Lapp&amp;#233;&amp;#8217;s presentation is titled
        Democracy&amp;#39;s Edge &amp;#8211; How to take back the America we love. Admission is
        free, though donations will be accepted to support the Willi Unsoeld Seminar Endowment.
        Lapp&amp;#233; currently leads the Small Planet Institute in Cambridge, Mass. along with her
        daughter Anna. The group works to foster positive democratic social change around the world.
        Lapp&amp;#233; is also the author of 15 books, including the bestseller Diet for a Small
        Planet, as well as her current book, Democracy&amp;#8217;s Edge: Choosing to save our
        country by bringing democracy to life.</p>
       <p>The Unsoeld Seminar Series brings to The Evergreen State College distinguished visitors
        who reflect the values and philosophy of Willi Unsoeld, a founding faculty member,
        philosopher, theologian and mountaineer. Beyond the Evergreen community, Unsoeld was well
        known for his first ascent of the West Ridge of Mt. Everest with Tom Hornbein, in which they
        made the first successful traverse of any Himalayan peak. For this feat, President John F.
        Kennedy presented them with the Hubbard Medal, The National Geographic Society&amp;#39;s
        highest honor. The annual Unsoeld Seminar is endowed as a &amp;quot;living
        memorial&amp;quot; in honor of Willi Unsoeld who lost his life in an avalanche on Mt.
        Rainier in 1979. The event is free and open to the public. For more information, call
        867-6402.</p>

       <p>From the Governor&amp;#8217;s Office to Grist Magazine, Leading Organizations Acknowledge
        The Evergreen State College for Green Innovation</p>
       <p>Sustaining nature requires a sustained commitment, and The Evergreen State College is
        gaining recognition for four-decades of dedication to environmental leadership and visible
        action on campus.</p>
       <p>In October, Evergreen accepted the <a
         href="http://www.ecy.wa.gov/programs/hwtr/GovAward/index.html">Governor&amp;#8217;s Award
         for Pollution Prevention and Sustainable Practices</a>, the state&amp;#8217;s top
        environmental honor.&amp;#160; In presenting the award, Kathleen Drew, the
        governor&amp;#8217;s executive policy advisor on sustainability and Jay Manning, director of
        Washington State&amp;#8217;s department of ecology highlighted Evergreen&amp;#8217;s Seminar
        II building.&amp;#160; Seminar II is Washington&amp;#8217;s first publicly funded education
        facility certified Gold by Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design. The building makes
        use of natural ventilation, recycled and sustainable materials, and green
        roofs.&amp;#160;</p>
       <p>The award also recognized Evergreen&amp;#8217;s commitment to reducing its carbon
        footprint and work to achieve a &amp;#8216;climate neutral&amp;#8217; campus by 2020,
        including completion of its first greenhouse gas inventory in 2007.&amp;#160;</p>
       <p>In September, The Evergreen State College received an honorable mention with the <a
         href="http://www.aashe.org/"><em>Association for the Advancement of Sustainability in
          Higher Education</em></a>, <a href="http://www.aashe.org/highlights/awards2007.php"
         >Sustainability Leadership Award</a>, a national honor that recognized the college for
        mitigating 100 percent of its electricity consumption thanks to a self imposed student
        fee.&amp;#160;&amp;#160; The Evergreen State College was one of only six organizations
        recognized by the association, which also noted that 40 percent of on-campus food at
        Evergreen is locally grown and/or organic product.&amp;#160;&amp;#160;<br/>
       </p>
       <p>And in August, Evergreen was recognized as one of <a
         href="http://www.grist.org/news/maindish/2007/08/10/colleges/">Grist Magazine&amp;#8217;s
         Top 15 Green Colleges</a> and Universities for its strong commitment to sustainability, for
        its organic farm, for its composting program, and for its student-voted commitment to
        purchasing 100 percent green power.&amp;#160;</p>
       <h3>Maintaining Momentum</h3>
       <p>&amp;#160;&amp;#8220;We have a long history of concern about the environment at
        Evergreen,&amp;#8221; says College President Thomas L. &amp;quot;Les&amp;quot; Purce,
        &amp;#8220;but our challenge now is to do more to make a difference through commitments to
        conservation that enrich students&amp;#8217; lives and enhance students&amp;#8217; role in
        our democracy.&amp;#8221;</p>

       <p>The City of Olympia and Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) are
        partnering on a joint study of city street and state highway systems on the west side of
        Olympia. The study will evaluate how well the systems work together to support the diverse
        transportation needs of the west side, now and in the future.</p>
       <p>A public workshop is scheduled Thursday, March 15 at 6:30 at Evergreen Christian
        Community, 1000 Black Lake Blvd. SW in Olympia. Participants can share their thoughts about
        West Olympia transportation and learn more about the project.</p>
       <p>Current street and highway networks on Olympia&amp;#39;s west side can hinder timely
        emergency response, efficient transit service, and pedestrian and bicycle access, the study
        will look at ways to more evenly distribute traffic and provide access to growth areas and
        examine mobility needs of transit, bicyclists, pedestrians and vehicles.</p>
       <p>For more information about the project, go to www.trpc.org/westolympia.</p>

        state. Direct, round-trip service runs every 10 minutes between 10 a.m. and 6:30 p.m. The
        park-and-ride shuttle location is at the Department of Licensing, 405 Black Lake Boulevard
        at 4th Avenue. Travel to Super Saturday is also available on Intercity Transit Route 41,
        departing downtown Olympia every 15 minutes from the Olympia Transit Center, located at
        State Avenue and Washington Street. Extra buses will go into service as needed from
        downtown. Buses drop off and pick up festival goers at The Evergreen State College&amp;#39;s
        Red Square, the center of the event. Bus service to Super Saturday runs from 10 a.m. to 6:30
        p.m. The event is open from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Historically, Intercity Transit has provided
        between 4,000 and 8,000 rides to the festival. &amp;quot;We are pleased to work with The
        Evergreen State College to make Super Saturday a successful event,&amp;quot; said Mike
        Harbour, Intercity Transit General Manager. &amp;quot;We invite residents to take this
        opportunity to try Intercity Transit service and experience, first hand, the high quality of
        service our employees provide to the community every day.&amp;quot;</p>
       <p><strong>PARK &amp;#38; RIDE EXPRESS SERVICE</strong><br/> Express shuttle service runs
        every 10 minutes from 10 a.m. to 6:30 p.m. from the Department of Licensing, 405 Black Lake
        Boulevard at Fourth Avenue. The designated park-and-ride area will be marked with yellow
        signs and parking is free! The round trip fare for Super Saturday shuttle service is $1.50,
        the same as a regular all-day pass. Passengers with a Reduced Fare Permit pay $.75 for a
        round trip. One-way fares are $.75 and $.35 respectively. Service is free for children five
        and under. All Intercity Transit passes are honored.</p>
       <p><strong>REGULAR BUS SERVICE</strong><br/> Intercity Transit will add an extra bus to its
        regular Saturday service on Route 41 to accommodate the higher demand. Service from downtown
        Olympia will run every 15 minutes. The bus departs the Olympia Transit Center in downtown
        Olympia and travels to Super Saturday via Division Street and Kaiser Road, picking up
        passengers at bus stops along the way. For the festival, Route 41 will depart downtown every
        15 minutes between 10:30 a.m. and 5 p.m. with return trips every 15 minutes between 11:03
        a.m. and 6:33 p.m. Route 41 will run its regular Saturday service schedule before 10:30 a.m.

       <p>(TACOMA, Wash.) - Their motto says it all: Enter to Learn, Depart to Serve. Students at
        The Evergreen State College&amp;#39;s Tacoma Campus are preparing themselves to start
        solving the world&amp;#39;s - and their communities&amp;#39; problems - with simple steps,
        right here in Tacoma, today. That&amp;#39;s the story you&amp;#39;ll hear if you attend the
        12th Annual Research, Showcase and Resource Fair at Evergreen Tacoma on Saturday, May 19
        from 1 to 5 p.m. The theme is &amp;quot;With Liberty and Justice for Whom?&amp;quot; The
        campus is located at 1210 6th Street in Tacoma. As the 200-plus students at
        Evergreen&amp;#39;s Tacoma Campus pull together the lessons learned from their
        interdisciplinary studies this year - studies in which art, science, literature, business,
        computer science, history and more are woven together to provide context and added insights
        - they&amp;#39;ll be applying their newfound knowledge and skills to real-world problems.
        When they present their projects May 19 to an audience of community leaders, fellow
        students, family, friends and the general public, their goal will be to share their
        knowledge and start changing the lives around them for the better. These students are young
        and not so young; African American, Asian, white and Hispanic; single and married; parents
        and grandparents; community college transfers pursuing a bachelor&amp;#39;s degree for the
        first time and students pursuing a &amp;quot;second chance&amp;quot; at college and, often,
        at life. Through presentations, displays, films and other activities, participants in the
        May 19 Showcase and Resource Fair will get practical information on dealing with issues that
        often stand as barriers to a better life. The Evergreen Tacoma students will be sharing
        insights and lessons learned that can break down many of those barriers and open doors to
        opportunity.</p>
       <p>Projects showcased at the fair will provide useful information to help people overcome
        barriers in their ongoing efforts to strengthen their families, gain access to necessary
        services and create stronger, more vibrant communities. General topic areas include economic
        development, education, law and public policy, public health and nutrition, psychology and
        counseling, social work and human services, youth, and technology. Some of the specific
        topics will include: HIV as a Health Disparity; Criminal Background Checks and Access to
        Housing; Eating Disorders; Maternal and Child Public Health; How to Navigate Veterans
        Benefits; Homeless Issues, Legal Issues and Chemical Dependency; Empowering Women in a
        Gender-Biased Society; Incarceration; Affordable/Free Activities for Families; Restoring
        Voter Rights; Gifted People - Information for People with Learning Disabilities; Youth
        Justice; Ready-Set-WASL; Healthy Ways to Deal with Stress; Adoption Rights; Exploring
        Barriers to Alternative Energy; Liberty and Justice in Art; Healthcare Services; Death and
        Dying; and The Gentrification of Tacoma.</p>
       <p>The Washington Legislature created The Evergreen State College in 1967 to provide a model
        education in the liberal arts and sciences in a public college setting. Evergreen pioneered
        many of the &amp;quot;learning community&amp;quot; ideas now taking root across the country.
        It&amp;#39;s also known for creating an environment where students read more, write more,
        study more and engage more actively with faculty and each other than the vast majority of
        colleges across the nation. Since 1996, Evergreen in Olympia has been identified as one of a
        handful of &amp;quot;Colleges That Change Lives.&amp;quot; Evergreen extended its successful
        interdisciplinary, student-centered model to Tacoma in 1982. With adaptations to reflect
        community and student needs, that model continues to bear fruit today; it continues to
        change lives. On the Web: <a href="http://www.evergreen.edu/tacoma"

       <p>SEATTLE, Wash. - Nalini Nadkarni, a faculty member at The Evergreen State College, will be
        presented with the Grace Hopper Outstanding Achievement Award, an honor recognizing Nadkarni
        for her pioneering work in <a
         href="http://www.evergreen.edu/news/releases/aug06/globalclimate.htm">forest canopy
         research</a>, and as a community leader and positive role model for students. The Hopper
        Awards, presented by the Seattle Girls&amp;#39; School, will be awarded at a luncheon May 22
        at the Westin Hotel.</p>
       <p>Nadkarni teaches Environmental Studies programs at Evergreen and is widely known for her
        work with forest canopy research, a world until recently, was largely unexplored. Her
        research is focused on the ecology of tropical and temperate forest canopies, particularly
        the role that canopy-dwelling plants play in forests. She carries out field research in
        Washington State and in Monteverde, Costa Rica with the support of the National Science
        Foundation and the National Geographic Society. She received her undergraduate degree in
        Biology from Brown University in 1976, her Ph.D in Forest Ecology from the University of
        Washington in 1983, and has published two books and over 55 scientific articles in
        scientific journals. For more information, call 206-709-2228, extension 208.</p>

       <p>The U.S. Department of Education awarded The Evergreen State College&amp;#39;s Upward
        Bound program a $1.7 million grant - allowing the college to continue a 31 year program that
        supports 90 high risk, low income first generation college students from the city of Tacoma
        and the Puyallup Indian Reservation. The program provides year-round academic support to
        help students meet high school graduation and college admission standards and be successful
        in college.<br/>
       </p>
       <p>Evergreen&amp;#39;s yearly award - $446,568 - was the second-highest award among the
        eleven Washington colleges and universities that received the federal funding. Evergreen
        Upward Bound, a part of the college&amp;#39;s regional outreach, serves students at Chief
        Leschi, Foss, Lincoln, Mt. Tahoma, River Ridge, Stadium, and Wilson high schools. During the
        summer, the program hosts a six-week summer residential program at the college.
        &amp;quot;The college strives to provide access to a college education, including access for
        populations under-represented in the past. We are very pleased to continue a program which
        has been very successful in providing this to students who are willing to work for
        it,&amp;quot; said Art Costantino, Evergreen&amp;#39;s Vice President for Student
        Affairs.<br/>
       </p>
       <p>The Upward Bound program is a part of the Department of Education&amp;#39;s TRIO programs,
        aimed at supporting and motivating students from disadvantaged backgrounds. Upward Bound
        traditionally serves high school students from low-income families; high school students
        from families in which neither parent holds a bachelor&amp;#39;s degree; and low-income,
        first-generation military veterans who are preparing to enter postsecondary education.
        During student surveys at Evergreen, forty percent of students indicated that their parents
        or primary caregivers have not earned a four-year degree.<br/>

        Building, on the left as you enter Red Square, the main campus plaza. Preview it online at
         <a href="http://academic.evergreen.edu/events/sciencecarnival/index.html"
         >http://academic.evergreen.edu/events/sciencecarnival/index.html</a>. The Science Carnival
        is free and open to the public.<br/>
        <br/> The popular event is designed for middle and high school students, including home
        school students, and anyone in the community that has an interest in science. Demonstrations
        will cover chemistry, physics, biology, astronomy, criminal science, marine science, optics,
        health science, food science, computer science, and much more. In the spirit of
        interdisciplinary education, a hallmark of the Evergreen learning experience, the event will
        include more than a dozen science-related art demonstrations in a wide range of media.</p>
       <p>"Many people don't realize that our liberal arts curriculum includes a broad range of
        rigorous science programs," explained Evergreen science staff member and event organizer
        Peter Robinson. "Science at Evergreen is taught by nationally and internationally recognized
        faculty - not graduate students - in small classes with hands-on opportunities for
        undergraduate research and access to sophisticated scientific equipment, including a
        scanning electron microscope and ultra-high-end analytical instruments. These types of
        opportunities are rare even at the largest research universities."<br/>
        <br/> Recent national attention has been placed on Evergreen's science programs, from
        National Science Foundation grants for the study of global warming and insects to student
        and faculty work to eliminate E.coli from the human food chain.<br/>
        <br/> "The Science Carnival is a fun way for our students to share their science learning
        with the community and for the community to learn more about Evergreen as well," Robinson
        added.</p>

       <p>More than 1155 students will walk across the stage and receive their diplomas at The
        Evergreen State College&amp;#39;s 36th commencement ceremony June 15 - in front of an
        audience of more than 5000. The ceremony begins at 1 p.m. on Red Square, and is open to the
        public. The college will confer bachelor of arts and bachelor of science degrees, as well as
        joint BA/BS degrees and masters degrees in teaching, public administration and environmental
        studies.</p>
       <p>Dr. Maxine Mimms, an Evergreen faculty member emeritus and long time educational pioneer
        will deliver the commencement address. Mimms is founder of the college&amp;#39;s Tacoma
        campus and during the 1950&amp;#39;s and 60&amp;#39;s, she served as a role model for
        African American elementary students. She has also served as a national educational
        consultant and most recently founded the Maxine Mimms Academy, a non-profit organization in
        Tacoma&amp;#39;s Hilltop neighborhood established to serve youth expelled or suspended from
        public schools. The program prepares students to succeed when they re-enter school. She also
        served as assistant to the director of the Women&amp;#39;s Bureau in the U.S. Department of
        Labor in the 1970&amp;#39;s.<br/>
        <br/> The ceremony is a bookend to a year where the college received significant national
        attention for work in eliminating E.coli from the food chain using Phage research, national
        acclaim for the level of academic challenge from the National Survey of Student Engagement -
        as well as a year that faculty, staff and students on campus during winter break saw
        significant disruptions after the December windstorm. For more information about the

       <h3>Purce Joins Higher Education Leaders Nationwide to Fight Global Warming</h3>
       <p>Olympia, Wash. - The Evergreen State College President Thomas L. " Les" Purce today joined
        over 250 other college and university presidents in formally committing to sharply reduce
        and eventually eliminate all of the college's global warming emissions. President Purce also
        pledged to accelerate research and educational efforts to equip society to re-stabilize the
        earth's climate. The American College &amp; University Presidents Climate Commitment was
        adopted today at a summit of higher education leaders in Washington, D.C. President Purce is
        a founding member of the Steering Committee for this national initiative.</p>
       <p>"Since 1971, Evergreen has built a national reputation for environmental studies at the
        undergraduate and graduate levels," Purce explained. " Its graduates and faculty are leaders
        in addressing environmental challenges locally, nationally and globally. By joining the
        Presidents Climate Commitment, and building sustainability into our strategic plan as a top
        priority, we are sharpening our focus on climate issues and environmental responsibility. We
        hope to set an example others can follow."Evergreen has set a goal of reaching climate
        neutrality by 2020 and is developing an institutional action plan to achieve that goal. As
        part of the plan, Evergreen has completed its first comprehensive greenhouse gas inventory
        to establish a baseline and help track progress.</p>
       <p>Evergreen has a long list of activities and initiatives already underway to promote
        environmental, social and economic sustainability (see below). For example, thanks to a
        self-imposed student fee, 100% of Evergreen' s electricity comes from "green" sources.
        Evergreen also built the state's first public L.E.E.D. gold certified building-Seminar II -
        with a wide range of energy efficient and environmentally friendly design features.</p>
       <p>"Sustainability isn't just a bandwagon we're hopping onto," Purce emphasized." It's woven
        into the very fabric of our identity, and history, as an institution."</p>
       <p>The Presidents Climate Commitment is the first such effort by any major sector of society
        to set climate neutrality - not just a reduction - as its target. This undertaking by
        America's colleges and universities is inspired by efforts like the U.S. Mayors Climate
        Protection Agreement, the U.S. Climate Action Partnership and other collective efforts by
        states and businesses.</p>
       <p>"Colleges and universities must lead the effort to reverse global warming for the health
        and well-being of current and future generations," said Michael Crow, President of Arizona
        State University and chair of the ACUPCC Steering Committee.</p>
       <p>The American College &amp; University Presidents Climate Commitment is a high-visibility
        effort to address global warming by garnering institutional commitments to neutralize
        greenhouse gas emissions, and to accelerate the research and educational efforts of higher
        education to equip society to re-stabilize the earth's climate. Under the guidance and
        direction of university presidents, the Commitment is being supported and implemented by the
        Association for the Advancement of Sustainability in Higher Education (AASHE), Second
        Nature, and ecoAmerica.</p>

       <h3>The Evergreen State College, St. Martin's University, South Puget Sound Community
        College, and Centralia College Commit to Focus the Nation on Global Warming.</h3>
       <h4>Event Commences at 7:00 p.m. at the Washington Center, January 30, 2008</h4>
       <p><br/> (Olympia, Wash)&amp;#160; The Evergreen State College, St. Martin's University,
        South Puget Sound Community College, and Centralia College have joined together to host a
        community forum on global warming to be held January 30, 2008 at the Washington Center for
        the Performing Arts &amp;#8211; Stage 1. The Focus the Nation community forum is free to the
        public. Doors will open at 6:00 p.m. and the forum will begin at 7:00 p.m. The first 500
        people through the door will receive an ENERGY STAR&amp;#174; qualified compact fluorescent
        light (CFL) bulb courtesy of Puget Sound Energy.<br/>
        <br/>
        <strong><em>Creating a Climate of Change: A Community Forum on Climate Change in the Pacific
          Northwest</em> will kick off with opening remarks by Seattle Mayor Greg Nickels.</strong>
        Mayor Nickels spearheaded the U.S. Conference of Mayors Climate Protection Agreement, in
        which mayors across the nation commit to reduce emissions in their cities to seven percent
        bforuelow 1990 levels by 2012. Since its launch in 2005, well over 500 mayors have committed
        to this goal, and the number continues to rise, highlighting concrete steps taken by
        communities throughout the country. The forum will also bring together local and state
        government officials, scientific experts and community members. The event will be moderated
        by the Associated Press state political writer David Ammons.&amp;#160;<br/>
        <br/>
        <strong>The event aims include the following:</strong></p>
       <ul>
        <li>increasing action to address the challenge of climate change locally with sound
         practices,</li>
        <li>increasing knowledge and personal commitments to assess and act for energy efficiency
         and assess strategies and technologies in efforts to deal with climate change,</li>
        <li>demonstrating area communities&amp;#8217; willingness to act with responsibility toward
         the climate.</li>
       </ul>
       <p>The partnering organizations are proud participants in Focus the Nation, a nationwide
        campaign that is bringing campuses and communities together to find solutions to the
        challenges of global warming. Activities will also take place at each of the campuses during
        the day. The day&amp;#8217;s global warming teach-in activities are coordinated by area
        institutions of higher education in an unprecedented partnership, including The Evergreen
        State College, the South Puget Sound Community College, Centralia College, and St.
        Martin&amp;#8217;s University. The growing list of sponsors for the event includes The City
        of Olympia, InterCity Transit, The Washington Center for the Performing Arts, and Puget
        Sound Energy.<br/>
        <br/> The event is part of a larger series of actions that Washington State and its academic
        communities are undertaking in continuing response to climate change.</p>

         title="Zhang Er book jacket"/>&amp;quot;So Translating Rivers and Cities&amp;quot; is a
        selection of work from Zhang Er&amp;#39;s three most recent Chinese manuscripts. Translators
        on the project included Evergreen faculty members Bill Ransom and Leonard Schwartz, both
        well-known poets and authors in their own right. &amp;quot;Everywhere in these poems, the
        image of enchantment becomes luminous fact of enlightenment,&amp;quot; writes award-winning
        poet and professor Donald Revell. &amp;quot;Wisdom proceeds through the enchanted eye into
        pure mind, finding no obstacle, broaching no impediment. The effect is of a sudden, entirely
        true transparency.&amp;quot;<br/>
        <br/> Zhang Er was one of the featured poets in Qinghai Lake International Poetry Festival
        at Xining, China this August. She was born in Beijing, China and moved to New York City in
        1986. Her poetry, non-fiction writing, and essays have appeared in publications in Taiwan,
        China, the American &amp;#233;migr&amp;#233; community and in a number of American journals.
        She is the author of multiple books in Chinese and in English translation. She has read from
        her work at international festivals, conferences, reading series and universities in China,
        France, Portugal, Russia, Peru, Singapore, Hong Kong as well as in the U.S. She currently
        teaches at Evergreen-Tacoma.<br/>
        <br/> Her new collection is available on Amazon.com or Zephyrpress.org.</p>

       <h3>Sheppard Honored at Cannes Film Festival</h3>
       <p>(Olympia, Wash.)&amp;#160; Evergreen faculty member Dr. Gilda Sheppard&amp;#39;s
        documentary film &amp;quot;Women Together as One&amp;quot; was the first ever short film
        selected for showing by Fest Afrique 360 at the 2007 Cannes Film Festival in France. The
        film&amp;#39;s world premiere was part of the Agora Lumiere Cinema Series showcasing the
        best work worldwide of filmmakers from Africa or of African descent. Sheppard also served on
        the series&amp;#39; &amp;quot;African Diaspora Cinema&amp;quot; panel.<br/>
        <br/>
        <img alt="Gilda Sheppard with camera" class="left"
         src="site://evergreen.edu/news/archives/images/gildashheppard008.gif"
         title="Gilda Sheppard with camera"/> &amp;quot;Women Together as One&amp;quot; focuses on
        work Sheppard did with Liberian women refugees who live at the Buduburam Refugee Camp in
        Ghana, West Africa. She worked with the refugees to organize and design classes for economic
        sustainability (computer literacy, adult literacy, cosmetology, catering, sewing and tie and
        dye workshops) and school scholarships for their children. Evergreen-Tacoma executive
        director and faculty member Dr. Artee Young, information technology systems specialist
        Luversa Sullivan and four youth from the Intel Computer Clubhouse and Girls and Boys Math,
        Science and Engineering programs at Evergreen-Tacoma visited the project and helped with the work.<br/>
        <br/> Another of Sheppard&amp;#8217;s films, &amp;quot;Theodor Wonja Michael: Interview with
        a Black Prussian Elder,&amp;quot; was presented at the Goethe Institute during the Pan
        African Film Festival in Ghana, West Africa. The film is a documentary on an interview with
        actor Theodor Wonja Michael conducted by author and researcher Anne Adams. In this
        interview, Michael speaks of the choices for survival of black German families before and
        after World War II, as well as the complications and triumphs of building a life in post-war
        Germany and into the 21st century.<br/>

       <p>The National Association of Student Personnel Administrators (NASPA) Division V region
        recently awarded The Day of Absence /Day of Presence organizing committee from The Evergreen
        State College the 2007 Innovative Program Award for its yearly diversity program efforts.
        The award was presented to representatives from the campus at this years NASPA convention in
        Las Vegas in October.</p>
       <p>Although many of Evergreen&amp;#8217;s campus events and activities focus on issues of
        diversity each and every day, the yearly observance, Day of Absence and Day of Presence,
        asks the entire campus to think about racial diversity for two days each year.</p>
       <p>The Day of Absence was originally a unity dinner celebrated by our African American
        faculty in the mid 70&amp;#8217;s. It grew to become an opportunity for all students, staff
        and faculty of color to gather off-campus for an educational and community-building
        retreat.</p>
       <p>The idea for the Day of Absence came from a play of the same name by African American
        playwright, Douglas Turner Ward. Presented in 1965, the play is a social commentary on race
        relations in the U.S. and satirizes the South&amp;#39;s refusal to see the African American
        as an equal member of the community. In the play, a town wakes up to find all of the African
        Americans missing, leaving those left to reflect on the meaning of their community without
        these valued members.</p>
       <p>In the mid 90&amp;#8217;s, the Day of Presence was added by students and staff of color in
        order to reunite the college community and honor diversity and unity as a whole campus.</p>
       <p>On the Day of Absence, while students and staff of color are off campus, typically, a
        group of white students and staff plan educational workshops and invite guest speakers to
        campus to work on issues of multiculturalism from an ally perspective.</p>
       <p>Depending on the ideas generated in the committee, the events look different every year.
        The primary function of the event has always been to give the campus an opportunity for
        community building and reflection around issues of culture, heritage and
        diversity.&amp;#160; Currently the open organizing committee is meeting weekly and would
        like to extend an invitation for anyone from the Evergreen community to participate, for
        more information contact Norma Alicia Pino or Raquel Salinas at First Peoples&amp;#8217;
        Advising Services, (360) 867-6467.</p>

       <p>(Olympia, Wash.) Students at The Evergreen State College reported higher than average
        engagement on all benchmark measures of the 2007 National Survey of Student Engagement
        (NSSE), which included academic challenge, active and collaborative learning,
        student-faculty interaction, enriching educational experiences, and a supportive campus
        environment.</p>
       <ul>
        <li>Students at The Evergreen State College were as engaged as students attending schools
         that scored in the top 10 percent on the Level of Academic Challenge benchmark.</li>
        <li>Evergreen students reported slightly higher engagement in Active and Collaborative
         Learning than students studying at schools who performed in the top 10 percent on this
         benchmark.</li>
        <li>Evergreen first-year students were as engaged as students attending colleges who scored
         in the top 10 percent in terms of Student-Faculty Interaction</li>
        <li>Evergreen seniors were as engaged in Enriching Educational Experiences as seniors in the
         top 10 percent of colleges.</li>
        <li>Evergreen students perceive a level of Supportive Campus Environment that is equal to
         that of students at the top 50 percent of institutions.</li>
       </ul>
       <p>Evergreen students scored strongly on Academic Challenge because they spend more time
        preparing for class, engaging in coursework that requires synthesizing, analyzing and making
        judgments about the value of information. They also reported reading more assigned texts.
        Compared with other first-year and senior-class students who reported to NSSE, Evergreen
        respondents indicated that they more frequently asked questions and contributed to
        discussions in class and gave class presentations. They also indicated that they more often
        worked with other students on projects during class and outside of class, as well as
        discussed ideas from reading and classes with others outside of class, all measures of
        Active and Collaborative Learning. In terms of Student-Faculty Interaction, Evergreen
        students more often discussed ideas from class with faculty members outside of class and
        more frequently received prompt feedback about their work than students at other
        institutions.</p>
       <p>Evergreen seniors were significantly more likely to have participated in several Enriching
        Educational Experiences than seniors at other colleges and universities, including
        participation in a learning community, study abroad, independent study, and more frequent
        conversations with students who are different from themselves in terms of race, ethnicity,
        religion, political opinions, or values.</p>
       <p>Six-hundred and ten colleges and universities participated in the survey. Evergreen
        conducts the National Survey of Student Engagement annually as part of its ongoing

       <h3>Evergreen&amp;#8217;s Visual History and Carbon Offsets Focus of Winning Proposals for
        2007-2008</h3>
       <p>(Olympia, Wash.)<span>&amp;#160;</span>
        <span>&amp;#160;&amp;#160;</span>The Evergreen Fund for Innovation supports pioneering
        efforts by members of the Evergreen community for projects that will shape the
        college&amp;#8217;s future.<span>&amp;#160;&amp;#160;</span> The award was established in
        1996 in an effort to keep Evergreen on the leading edge of higher
         education.<span>&amp;#160;&amp;#160;</span> Two winning teams were announced the 2007-2008
        academic year.<span>&amp;#160;&amp;#160;</span></p>
       <p>The team of Sally J. Cloninger, Evergreen faculty; Peter Randlette, Evergeen adjunct
        faculty; Randy Stilson, Evergreen adjunct faculty; and Jules Unsel, interdisciplinary media
        faculty librarian were awarded the <em>Evergreen Fund for Innovation</em> award for their
        project to establish <em>The Evergreen Visual History
         Archive.</em><span>&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;</span> With this project, team members
        will work to preserve the visual and aural media record of Evergreen&amp;#8217;s academic
        mission and accomplishments since the college&amp;#8217;s inception.</p>
       <p>The team of Robert Cole, Evergreen faculty; Dylan Fischer, Evergreen faculty; and
        Alexandra Kazakova, Evergreen student were awarded the <em>Fund for Innovation Award</em>
        for their proposal <em>Carbon Fluxes in Our Forest and Carbon Offsets as a Piece of
         Evergreen&amp;#8217;s Goal of Carbon Neutrality by 2020</em>.<span>&amp;#160;</span> The
        research team will work to examine and address the efficacy of purchasing carbon offsets and
        will also address the carbon uptake and carbon-offset potential associated with the
        management of the un-built Evergreen State College forest reserves.<span>&amp;#160;</span>
        <span>&amp;#160;</span></p>
       <p>Successful proposals focus on innovative ideas that may be sustained after the award and
        represent the best that Evergreen has to offer in interdisciplinary and cross-divisional
         collaboration.<span>&amp;#160;&amp;#160;</span> Awards for 2007-2008 also addressed the
        challenges and opportunities posed by <em>The Evergreen State College Strategic Plan
         Update</em> available at http://www.evergreen.edu/president/docs/strategicplanup07.pdf</p>

          Wash.</span></strong><strong><span>&amp;#160; -</span></strong>
        <span>The Evergreen State College collected coats in their inaugural
         &amp;#160;&amp;#8220;One Warm Coat&amp;#8221; drive.</span> Students, faculty, staff and
        members of the community donated the coats during the week-long drive organized by
        Evergreen&amp;#8217;s Athletic Department.<br/>
        <span><br/> At last weeks men&amp;#8217;s basketball home games, donors were able to
         exchange their coats for free admission.<br/> &amp;#160;<br/> Following this drive 168
         coats were collected. These coats were given to the Olympia Union Gospel Mission, an
         organization dedicated to helping the poor and needy. &amp;#160;<br/> &amp;#160;<br/> Head
         Men&amp;#8217;s Basketball Coach Jeff Drinkwine led the coat drive.
         &amp;#160;&amp;#8220;It&amp;#8217;s that time of the year when many do not have the
         necessities to stay warm during the winter months&amp;#8221; notes Drinkwine.<br/>
         &amp;#160;<br/> Evergreen sports programs are happy to extend their commitment to the
         community in the coming year. &amp;#160;Geoduck athletes will continue to be in public
         schools reading to children, working with incarcerated youth and collecting food for local
         food banks.<br/>

       <p>SEATTLE (Nature Conservancy) - Nalini Nadkarni, a professor at The Evergreen State College
        in Olympia and renowned forest canopy specialist, returns to the board of trustees for the
        Washington chapter of the Nature Conservancy, the organization announced Friday.</p>
       <p>Nadkarni, who served on the Nature Conservancy&amp;#39;s board from 1998 to 2004, is an
        ardent believer in the value of forest conservation. In 1994 she co-founded the
        International Canopy Network, a non-profit organization designed to facilitate communication
        among researchers, educators, and conservationists concerned with the welfare of forest
        canopies.</p>
       <p>Appearing on the National Geographic Emmy Award-winning documentary, &amp;quot;Heroes of
        the High Frontier,&amp;quot; Nadkarni has long sought new ways to educate the general
        public, children, and policymakers about the ecological significance of forest canopies and
        forest conservation. Her latest project, the Forest Canopy Walkway, can be found on The
        Evergreen State College campus.</p>
       <p>Nadkarni has received a Guggenheim Fellowship to help support her efforts to communicate
        the importance of forest canopy research to non-scientists.</p>

       <p>OLYMPIA - The Evergreen State College Board of Trustees approved a resolution yesterday
        authorizing issuance of bonds for significant improvements to the college&amp;#39;s
        residence hall system.</p>
       <p>The bonds are expected to be issued for approximately eight million dollars, earmarked for
        projects leading to renewal of aging facilities as well as adding more capacity.</p>
       <p>&amp;quot;We&amp;#39;re very excited to get started on this work and are confident that it
        will make important improvements very visible and valuable to our students,&amp;quot; said
        John Lauer, director of Evergreen&amp;#39;s student housing system.</p>
       <p>The plans include new flooring and furniture replacement throughout the residence halls,
        new roofs on the apartment-style halls, a new housing administration center and seismic
        upgrades to the largest student housing facility on campus, the eight-story 110,000 square
        foot A-Building.</p>
       <p>The plan also includes the addition of thirty new beds to the approximately 1000-bed
        system. The first phase of residence halls at Evergreen was completed in 1972, and the
        second phase of apartment-style halls was completed between 1987 and 1989.</p>

       <p><em><strong>Nationally known Evan Wolfson featured speaker for college&amp;#39;s lecture
          series</strong></em><br/>
        <br/> OLYMPIA -- Lesbian/gay civil rights leader Evan Wolfson will be the featured speaker
        for The Evergreen State College&amp;#39;s 2006 Cal Anderson Memorial Lecture Series on
        January 24 at Temple Beth Hatfiloh in downtown Olympia. The event is free and open to the public.<br/>
        <br/> Wolfson is currently the executive director of Freedom to Marry organization in New
        York. An attorney, Wolfson has also served as director of the Lambda Legal Defense and
        Education Fund, one of the nation&amp;#39;s leading advocacy organizations.<br/>
        <br/> Wolfson has participated in numerous legal cases around the nation including the
        landmark 2004 <em/><em>Baker v. Vermont</em> case - the Vermont Supreme Court ruling that
        led to the creation of civil unions. Wolfson has also led cases with gay/lesbian military
        personnel and their right to serve; New York City employees&amp;#39; equal health benefits
        and recognition for their partners and a person with AIDS who was denied life-saving medical
        treatment by his insurer. In 2000, Wolfson became the first Lambda attorney to argue in
        front of the United States Supreme Court.<br/>
        <br/> In 2000, the <em/><em>National Law Journal</em> named Wolfson one of &amp;quot;The 100
        most influential attorneys in America,&amp;quot; and in 2004, <em/><em>Time Magazine</em>
        named him as one of &amp;quot;The 100 most influential people in the world.&amp;quot;<br/>
        <br/> The memorial lecture series is named in honor of Cal Anderson, Washington
        state&amp;#39;s first openly gay lawmaker representing the University District and Capitol
        Hill areas of Seattle.<br/>
        <br/> Anderson was appointed to the state house in 1987 and elected to terms in 1988, 1990
        and 1992. He was then elected to the state senate in 1994 and served until his death in
        August 1995. A Vietnam-era veteran, Anderson was the recipient of two Bronze Stars and four
        Army commendation medals. He supported a number of causes including environmental
        protection, veterans benefits and campaign finance reform. He is also well-known for his
        leadership in fighting for equal civil rights protection for gays and lesbians, and for
        securing funding for HIV/AIDS programs.</p>

       </p>
       <p>In his installation, &amp;quot;Changing Spaces,&amp;quot; explores how sound creates a
        sense of place and space.&amp;#160; Scholtz says &amp;quot;you see what is in front of your
        eyes but you hear what is all around you.&amp;quot;&amp;#160; In the installation, real-time
        recordings create the musical frame of beginning and end.&amp;#160; Ordinary sounds take on
        a different meaning; a succession of sounds gives rise to harmony, rhythm and emotion.</p>
       <p>Scholtz will be present at the opening on Thursday, Jan. 19 from 5 - 7 p.m.</p>
       <p>A Bellingham resident, Scholtz has been a professional musician since 1974, working in
        many aspects of music performance, education, and recording.&amp;#160; He has recorded with
        Tom Hunter and Eric Schoenberg and provided musical accompaniment to stories told by
        Margaret Read MacDonald on three compact discs published by August House. Scholtz has also
        administered the Puget Sound Guitar Workshop for over 30 years.</p>

        <em>EPA, Washington State Senate honor Evergreen's commitment</em>
       </p>
       <p>OLYMPIA , Wash. -- The Evergreen State College and the hard work of students have been
        recognized with two distinct honors in the past week for the college's commitment to
        renewable energy.</p>
       <p>The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency released the list of the nation's top-ten college
        and university green power purchasers today - and The Evergreen State College is eighth in
        the nation with the amount of green power purchased. All of the electricity used at the main
        campus in Olympia , as well as the Tacoma campus is green, translating to enough energy for
        more than 1500 homes per year, according to the EPA.</p>
       <p>Green energy is non-polluting and is renewable. Common sources of green energy include
        geothermal power, wind power - which is the type Evergreen purchases - and solar and tidal
        power. About one million homes in the U.S. purchase green energy.</p>
       <p>"The Evergreen State College is providing an excellent example for its students, faculty,
        employees, and community by purchasing green power," said Blaine Collison, program director
        of the EPA's Green Power Partnership. "The College's actions are helping drive the
        development of new renewable energy sources. As more renewable energy power plants are
        developed, the overall air emissions associated with electricity generation will be
        reduced."</p>
       <p>Evergreen senior Brad Bishop was a leader in the campus effort to bring 100 percent green
        energy to Evergreen. He says that the project enabled students to use something much more
        than textbooks as a learning tool - the college's physical environment.</p>
       <p>"This project was not just about supporting green energy, it was an opportunity to take it
        on, and use the college's setting and be innovative," Bishop says. He is also the co-chair
        of the Campus Clean Energy Committee.</p>
       <p>Evergreen president Thomas L. "Les" Purce said "our commitment to green power is very much
        in line with our educational and environmental values. It's a significant honor to be named
        as one of the nation's top-ten institutions for renewable energy - I'm proud of the work
        that our students have done."</p>
       <p>Evergreen was also honored by the state senate last week with a resolution recognizing the
        work of students, staff and faculty with renewable energy, the college's 100 percent
        commitment to green power, and the Power Player Award that Evergreen received from Puget
        Sound Energy and Seattle City Light.</p>
       <p>"I was very happy that this is an important enough thing for the legislature to be talking
        about...this issue is becoming more popular and I hope that the legislature will spur
        further development," says Bishop, who was at the senate during the ceremony.</p>
       <p>The EPA's Green Power Partnership is a voluntary program to increase the use of green
        power in the U.S. Partners in the program switch to green power for all or a portion of
        their electricity needs in return for EPA technical assistance and recognition.&amp;#160;
        The Green Power Partnership has more than 600 partners, including Fortune 500 companies,
        states, federal agencies, trade associations, and colleges and universities.</p>

       <p>Evergreen State College professor Dr. Betty Kutter, a national leader in bacterial phage
        research, will give a lecture Monday, Feb. 6 from 3:30 - 5 p.m. on the Evergreen campus in
        the Seminar II Building, room D 1105.</p>
       <p>The presentation is titled "Fighting Bacterial Infections Along the Silk Roads: Tbilisi,
        Georgia and the development of bacteriophages as natural, self-replicating and self-limiting
        antibiotics."</p>
       <p>Kutter's work in bacteriophage and antibiotic resistance research has remained a staple of
        Evergreen's undergraduate research program since she arrived in 1972, garnering national and
        international attention. Kutter also founded the PhageBiotics Foundation.</p>
       <p>Kutter's presentation will give background in Georgian national history, discussing the
        powerful potential uses of phage as antibiotics, the connections between Evergreen and
        Georgia, and the work being carried out with phages against the food borne disease E. coli
         <em>as well as and</em> Aeromonas salmonicida infections that can plague our state and
        tribal salmon hatcheries.</p>

       <p>OLYMPIA, Wash. &amp;#8212; For the fourth year running, the Princeton Review has named The
        Evergreen State College one of the nation&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;best value&amp;quot; four-year
        colleges. The New York-based education services company features Evergreen in the 2007
        edition of its book, <em>America&amp;#39;s Best Value Colleges</em> (Random House/Princeton
        Review, $18.95.)</p>
       <p>&amp;quot;Being selected as one of the nation&amp;#39;s best value colleges again this
        year makes clear our commitment to providing one of the best liberal arts educations in
        America, along with an equal commitment to remain as accessible as possible to
        students,&amp;quot; said Thomas L. &amp;quot;Les&amp;quot; Purce, Evergreen&amp;#39;s
        president.</p>
       <p>Evergreen joins the University of Washington, Washington State University and the
        University of Idaho as the only colleges in the Pacific Northwest to be selected. The guide
        profiles 150 public and private colleges in 40 states with excellent academics, generous
        financial aid packages and relatively low costs. Editors based their rankings on data
        obtained from administrators at more than 646 colleges and from surveys of students
        attending them.</p>
       <p>&amp;quot;We considered over 30 factors to rate the colleges in four categories:
        academics, tuition GPA (the sticker price minus average amount students receive in
        scholarships and grants), the level of financial aid support and student
        borrowing,&amp;quot; explains Robert Franek, vice president for publishing at The Princeton
        Review. According to Franek, the company recommends the 150 schools in the book as
        America&amp;#39;s best college education deals.</p>

       <p>OLYMPIA -- Less than a week after Tom Boatright announced his resignation as men&amp;#39;s
        soccer coach at The Evergreen State College, the Geoducks have announced that long-time
        South Puget Sound Community College coach John Purtteman has been hired to fill the
        position.</p>
       <p>&amp;quot;This was the easiest hire we have made since I have been at Evergreen,&amp;quot;
        said sixth-year athletics director Dave Weber. &amp;quot;Like Tom and our women&amp;#39;s
        coach, Erik Gibson-Snyder, John is another graduate of the great Geoduck teams coached by
        Arno Zoske and he&amp;#39;s proven himself in a decade of college coaching at
        SPSCC.&amp;quot;</p>
       <p>Purtteman, who coached the Clippers from 1992-95 and from 2000-2005, led SPSCC to within a
        game of the Northwest Athletic Association of Community Colleges championship in 2004 with a
        13-4-3 record - the same year Boatright took Evergreen to the Elite Eight of the NAIA
        National Championships.</p>
       <p>Twice Evergreen&amp;#39;s MVP while playing two seasons each for Willie Lippmann and Zoske
        from 1981-84, Purtteman went on to play professionally for the Portland Pride, Seattle
        Seadogs, Florida Thundercats and Denver Thunder. He was twice named to the Continental
        Indoor Soccer League all-star team.</p>
       <p>In addition to his new duties at Evergreen, Purtteman serves as coaching director of the
        South Sound Select youth program and owns the Golden Goals residential soccer camp in Union,
        along Hood Canal.</p>
       <p>&amp;quot;One of goals for all our sports programs at Evergreen is for them to become a
        contributing member of the local community, on and off the field,&amp;quot; said Weber.
        &amp;quot;John is integrated into the soccer community here already at all levels. The
        philosophy he brings to his camps, the Select program and his college teams is very positive
        and growth-oriented for each athlete.</p>
       <p>&amp;quot;An obvious goal is for our team to continue winning its share of matches and
        John has proven he can do that at the college level. He should be able to make the most of
        the momentum Coach Boatright&amp;#160; -who led the Geoducks into regional play each of the
        last two seasons -&amp;#160;created.&amp;quot;</p>
       <p>At least some members of Boatright&amp;#39;s staff are expected to remain as assistants to
        Purtteman, who will begin recruiting immediately.</p>

       <p>OLYMPIA , Wash. -- A new language center has opened at The Evergreen State College this
        week, creating a space that can be used by students &amp;#8212; as well as faculty and staff
        to learn or brush up on foreign languages.<br/>
        <br/> The new center is located in the Seminar II Building, room A3116.<br/>
        <br/> &amp;quot;Our language and culture programs are certainly one of the strongest areas
        of academic offerings here at Evergreen. History, literature, culture and language are
        studied in a single comprehensive program, offering students an intensive
        immersion,&amp;quot; says Evergreen faculty member Pat Krafcik.<br/>
        <br/> The Community Language Lab is also a lounge area where students can speak and learn
        from each other, utilize program tutors and use foreign language computer software.<br/>
        <br/> More than ten languages can be studied at the lab.<br/>
        <br/> &amp;quot;From my perspective as a faculty member, it is absolutely crucial that our
        students learn languages and be immersed in other cultures. I think one of the biggest
        challenges we face in working with the world community is that many people do not understand
        other cultures,&amp;quot; Krafcik says.<br/>
        <br/> While it&amp;#39;s important to learn language to understand other cultures, Krafcik
        also says that it&amp;#39;s also critical to helping others solve serious problems around
        the world.<br/>
        <br/> Evergreen faculty members Susan Fiksdal and Judith Gabriele also worked along side
        Krafcik to open the new lab.<br/>
        <br/> The language center was a cooperative effort from individuals around campus, and
        organizers say they are grateful for their work.<br/>
        <br/> &amp;quot;This is an initial step,&amp;quot; Krafcik says, &amp;quot;our greatest wish
        is that people will come and use the lab. we hope the campus community will respond to this
        so that the lab can grow and become a staple of the campus.&amp;quot;</p>

        <em>Evergreen&amp;#8217;s new green building achieves a first environmental honor</em>
       </p>
       <p>OLYMPIA, Wash. -- The floors of a junior high school gym and an old building in Everett
        have helped to make gold.<br/>
        <br/> The Evergreen State College&amp;#8217;s Seminar II Building is the first publicly
        funded educational facility in Washington state to earn a &amp;#8216;gold&amp;#8217;
        Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) certification.</p>
       <p>The LEED system is the national standard in assessing and developing high-performance
        sustainable buildings. It was developed by the U.S. Green Building Council - and places part
        of its focus on the reuse of materials and resources.</p>
       <p>That&amp;#8217;s where the old floors come in.</p>
       <p>All of the wood flooring in the college&amp;#8217;s new state-of-the-art building came
        from Highland Junior High school near Yakima, and Floral Hall, a building owned by the City
        of Everett.</p>
       <p>According to the U.S. Green Building Council, the LEED system provides a framework for
        assessing building performance and meeting sustainability goals based on well-founded
        scientific standards. LEED emphasizes sustainable site-development, water savings, energy
        efficiency, material &amp;#38; resources selection and indoor environmental quality.</p>
       <p>The 160,000 square foot classroom and office building on Evergreen&amp;#8217;s Olympia
        campus is one of the most significant green projects in the region, and has received other
        honors, including being named as one of the top-ten green projects in the nation by the
        American Institute of Architects, as well as an award of merit from the Institute at a
        Seattle Awards banquet.</p>
       <p>Nancy Johns, an assistant director of Evergreen&amp;#8217;s Facilities Services says
        &amp;#8220;it was a critical goal for us to have a building that supports our teaching model
        and to involve students, staff and faculty in all stages of the design phase to ensure that
        we were incorporating the community&amp;#8217;s environmental goals and
        objectives.&amp;#8221;</p>
       <p>She credits the achievement to the 15-member college design team, in particular, Evergreen
        faculty member Rob Knapp for his work with the design of Seminar II and Robyn Herring, the
        college&amp;#8217;s coordinator of environmental health and safety for reviewing the
        materials used on the project. Johns also credits the design team led by Mahlum Architects
        and the general contractor, DPR Construction.</p>
       <p>The Evergreen building is one of only two publicly funded buildings in Washington to
        achieve the gold certification; the other is a Department of Corrections building in
        Monroe.</p>

       <p>OLYMPIA, Wash. -- Important student support programs will be honored around the nation in
        April and The Evergreen State College plans to make a day of it - featuring musical
        performances, student speakers and a keynote address.</p>
       <p>TRIO Day at Evergreen is slated for April 12 from 2:30 to 4 p.m. at the college&amp;#39;s
        Longhouse Education and Cultural Center. It is open to the public and free of charge.</p>
       <p>In 1965, Congress created a series of programs designed to make higher education
        accessible to first generation college students and low-income students. This original
        series of three became known as the TRIO programs (although now there are five). Evergreen
        hosts two of the TRIO programs, Upward Bound and KEY.</p>
       <p>The keynote speaker at the event is educator and motivational speaker Dr. Gary Jones.</p>
       <p>At Evergreen, Upward Bound has been serving low-income high school students from the
        Tacoma , Shelton and Lacey areas since 1977. Upward Bound provides students with academic
        support services, cultural awareness, career guidance and access to campus life and college
        programs. Over the past 29 years, Evergreen&amp;#39;s Upward Bound program has served more
        than 1200 students. For the past ten years at least 90 percent of participants graduated
        from high school and more than 80 percent of them enrolled in college.</p>
       <p>In 1979, KEY Student Support Services began serving low-income students, first generation
        college students, and students with disabilities. The program provides academic support and
        individual assistance to help students stay in college and graduate.&amp;#160; Each year,
        200 Evergreen students participate - and benefit from - KEY&amp;#39;s comprehensive support
        services. KEY Students graduate from Evergreen at a rate of over 90 percent.</p>
       <p>For more information, contact KEY Student Services at (360) 867-6464. Campus parking is
        $1.25.</p>

       <p>OLYMPIA, Wash. -- Renowned zoologists Delia and Mark Owens will deliver a lecture entitled
        &amp;#8220;High Stakes Conservation: Saving Elephants by Giving Alternative Jobs to
        Poachers&amp;#8221; at 6 p.m. on Tuesday, May 2 at The Evergreen State College&amp;#8217;s
        Longhouse Education and Cultural Center. The event is free and open to the public.<br/>
        <br/> During their lecture, the zoologists will initially discuss the severely diminished
        state of the elephant population in the North Luangwa Park, Zambia upon their arrival in
        1986. They will provide a detailed account of their successful and charismatic effort to
        obstruct poaching through the provision of education, health care, and sustainable
        alternative jobs for local villagers, as well as their effort in aiding Zambian government
        game scouts. They will also explain how over the following ten years, with poaching
        controlled, they were able to conduct one of the most intensive and longest running research
        projects focused on a heavily poached elephant population. As a result, today 20,000
        villagers have improved quality of life, poaching has declined significantly, and the
        elephants are recovering.</p>
       <p>Delia Owens, Ph.D., and Mark Owens M.Ed., have conducted research and conservation
        projects on endangered species in Africa for 23 years. Together they have authored three
        books, Cry of the Kalahari The Eye of the Elephant and their most recent, published this
        year, Secrets of the Savanna. They also founded the Owens Foundation for Wildlife
        Conservation, whose mission is to foster, fund, institute, underwrite, and in other ways
        promote wildlife conservation research, education, and wildlife resource protection and
        development with particular emphasis on threatened species and their habitats in Africa and
        North America.</p>
       <p>2006 marks the 16th annual Rachel Carson Forum, one of the largest free events open to
        students and the public on the Evergreen Campus. The forum is hosted by the <a
         href="http://www.evergreen.edu/mes/">Graduate Program in Environmental Studies</a> and
        funded by student activities fees. The Rachel Carson Forum was founded by former Master of
        Environmental Studies student Eli Sterling. The forum was designed to bring a prominent
        environmental speaker to the Evergreen campus annually. Students in the graduate program
        elect the speaker.<br/>
        <br/> The forum honors Rachel Carson (1907-1964) who is probably best known for Silent
        Spring her book that chronicles the impacts of pesticides on ecosystems. A well known piece
        of scientific synthesis, Silent Spring created an ecological theory of pesticides that
        remains substantially intact today, over 40 years after her book&amp;#8217;s publication.
        Carson&amp;#39;s writings were important in building the philosophy of modern environmental
        protection.</p>

       <p>Jennifer Harbury, an acclaimed human rights lawyer, activist and author will make a free
        public presentation at The Evergreen State College on May 10, 2006. Ms Harbury&amp;#8217;s
        most recent book is Truth, Torture and the American Way: The History and Consequences of
        U.S. Involvement in Torture (Beacon Press, 2005).</p>
       <p>Harbury&amp;#39;s talk is May 10th from 1:00-3:00pm in Lecture Hall 1 at Evergreen. The
        subject the talk is &amp;#8220;Torture and U.S. Foreign Policy: What Can We Do?&amp;#8221; A
        question and answer session will follow her presentation.</p>
       <p>Jennifer Harbury came to public attention in the 1990s when she participated in vigils and
        hunger strikes in front of the White House and the National Palace of Guatemala, attempting
        to hold the US and Guatemalan governments to account for the 1992 disappearance of her
        husband, Efrain Bamaca Velasquez (Comandante Everardo) of the Mayan resistance group URNG
        (National Revolutionary Union of Guatemala). As a result of public pressure and support from
        some members of the U.S. Congress, it came to light that her husband had been tortured and
        murdered by Guatemalan military officers who were on the CIA payroll. Ms Harbury presently
        continues her work in association with the Torture Abolition and Survivors Support Coalition
        in Washington, D.C.<br/>
        <br/> Jennifer Harbury, who was invited to Evergreen by the Master of Public Administration
        (MPA) program, will give several lectures on campus. In addition to the MPA, her visit is
        sponsored by the programs &amp;#8220;Making a Difference: Doing Social Change&amp;#8221; and
        &amp;#8220;Vietnam and Iraq Wars: Uncomfortable Parallels,&amp;#8221; as well as the
        Women&amp;#8217;s Resource Center and the Deans&amp;#8217; fund for speakers.<br/>
        <br/> For further information about Ms Harbury&amp;#8217;s visit to Evergreen, contact
        Martha Schmidt, visiting professor, MPA, by phone at 360-867-5606 or by <a

       <p>The major spring exhibition at Evergreen Galleries, Paul Sparks: Friends, Cronies, and
        Colleagues, honors Paul Sparks, an innovative artist and teacher who recently retired after
        32 years of teaching at The Evergreen State College. The opening reception is Friday, April
        28 from 6 to 9 p.m, and the exhibition runs through May 18 at Gallery 4, on the fourth floor
        of the Evans Library Building.</p>
       <p>Sparks may be best known for his influence on individuals as diverse as Comics Stars
        Charles Burns, Lynda Barry, and Matt Groening; art theorist Doug Kahn; and the cult
        filmmaker Steven DeJarnette. Sparks may be less well known as an artist, although he is
        represented in most of the major photography collections in the United States and Europe and
        has taught and worked with a variety of media over the last three decades. However, over the
        years, Sparks has been adamant that his real creative work is teaching.</p>
       <p>To highlight both aspects of his creative work, Sparks&amp;#8217; artworks will be shown
        alongside works by long-time friends and colleagues and by some of his most recent students.
        Artworks exhibited will be primarily painting, with several works of sculpture and
        photography. Participating artists include: Caroline Anderson, Michael Anderson, Vann
        Cantin, Anthony Cotham, Sean Ferris, Bob Haft, Claire Johnson, Mike Kohlmeier, Michael
        Leavitt, Chris Nelson, Chauney Peck, Tim Roberts, Eve Shaw, Darin Shuler, Nathan Smith,
        Sarah Utter, Sharon Warden, Ed Wicklander.</p>
       <p>Normal gallery hours are Monday-Friday, 12 - 4 p.m. and are free and open to the public.
        Campus parking is $1.25. For more information, go to <a

        <strong>
         <em>Lifton headlines the 20th anniversary Willi Unsoeld Seminar</em>
        </strong>
       </p>
       <p>The Willi Unsoeld Seminar is bringing noted author and psychiatrist Robert Jay Lifton to
        The Evergreen State College on Tuesday, April 25th at 8 p.m. The free event takes place in
        the Communications Building Recital Hall at Evergreen and is open to the public.<br/>
        <br/> The annual lecture series, which celebrates its 20th anniversary this year, honors
        Willi Unsoeld, leader of the first American expedition to reach the summit of Mt. Everest on
        May 22, 1963. A philosopher, theologian and mountaineer, Unsoeld was a founding member of
        the Evergreen faculty. He died in an avalanche on Mount Rainier in March 1979.<br/>
        <br/> This year&amp;#8217;s speaker, Dr. Robert Jay Lifton, has spent his life trying to
        understand the horror and violence that is an undeniable part of human experience. Following
        September 11, 2001, he undertook a study of Islamist apocalyptic violence and American
        responses to 9/11, culminating in his 2003 book Superpower Syndrome: America&amp;#39;s
        Apocalyptic Confrontation with the World.</p>
       <p>His writings on Nazi doctors (their killing in the name of healing) and the problem of
        genocide; nuclear weapons and their impact on death symbolism; Hiroshima survivors; Chinese
        thought reform and the Chinese Cultural Revolution; psychological trends in contemporary men
        and women; and the Vietnam War experience and Vietnam veterans have appeared in a variety of
        professional and popular journals. His newest book, Crimes of War - Iraq, coedited with
        Richard Falk and Irene Gendzier, was published in February 2006.</p>
       <p>Lifton is lecturer in psychiatry at the Harvard Medical School and the Cambridge Health
        Alliance, and distinguished professor emeritus of psychiatry and psychology at The City
        University of New York. He was formerly director of The Center on Violence and Human
        Survival at John Jay College of Criminal Justice and had previously held the
        Foundations&amp;#8217; Fund Research Professorship of Psychiatry at Yale University for more
        than two decades.</p>
       <p>Lifton&amp;#8217;s work fits in well with the philosophy of Willi Unsoeld. &amp;#8220;For
        me, the ultimate goal of all education is to help people treat each other better,&amp;#8221;
        said Unsoeld, explaining his educational philosophy about a year before he died.
        &amp;#8220;If I were to rip the heart out of all the educational philosophy which I have
        absorbed during my eight years at The Evergreen State College, I would crystallize it into a
        single paradoxical resolution of the old educational conundrum: &amp;#8216;Are you basically
        a &amp;#8216;content&amp;#8217; person or a &amp;#8216;process&amp;#8217; person?&amp;#8217;
        The start of my answer would be an unabashed statement: &amp;#8216;I am definitely a process
        person.&amp;#8217; By this I mean that the highest value which I attach to the educational
        enterprise is the encouragement it gives to the development of supportive relationships
        among people.&amp;#8221;</p>
       <p>As he saw it, the basic assumptions upon which Evergreen curriculum rested were that
        knowledge is holistic, leading to cross-disciplinary programs instead of traditional
        courses; that education is a life-long process in which the emphasis should be placed on
        learning how to learn while enjoying the company of a community of co-learners; and a major
        part of the curriculum should be aimed at the transmission of moral values within a social
        context.</p>
       <p>Willi Unsoeld&amp;#8217;s wife, former U.S. Representative Jolene Unsoeld, will introduce
        Dr. Lifton. He will sign copies of his books, which will be available for sale after the
        lecture.</p>

       <p>OLYMPIA, Wash. -- The academic program &amp;#8216;Reconstructing New Orleans&amp;#8217; at
        The Evergreen State College will host an all-day symposium focused on challenges facing New
        Orleans and the Gulf Coast in light of one of the most severe natural disasters in U.S.
        history, Hurricane Katrina.</p>
       <p>The symposium is from <strong>9 a.m. to 8 p.m. Friday, May 26</strong> at the
        college&amp;#8217;s Longhouse Education and Cultural Center. It is free and open to the
        public.</p>
       <p>Guest speakers include Malik Rahim, Founder of the Common Ground Collective in New
        Orleans, Jerome Scott, Executive Director of Project South in Atlanta and host of the June
        2007 U.S. Social Forum.</p>
       <p>Organizers say the symposium is critical especially in light of the fact that eight months
        after Katrina half of the city is without basic services such as public schools, public
        health care, and public housing -- in light of the fact that more than half of the
        city&amp;#8217;s population still remains living around the country, as well as a recently
        released U.S. Senate report that concluded that the nation is still unprepared for any
        disaster on the scale of Hurricane Katrina.</p>
       <p>For more information, call 867-6408. Campus parking is $1.25.</p>

        <strong>Counting the days to commencement; more than 1300 to walk</strong>
        <br/>
        <em>Gov. Christine Gregoire to deliver Evergreen&amp;#39;s commencement address</em>
       </p>
       <p>OLYMPIA &amp;#8212; Gov. Chris Gregoire will deliver the keynote address at <a
         href="http://www.evergreen.edu/streams/">The Evergreen State College&amp;#39;s 35th
         commencement ceremony</a> Friday, June 16 at the college&amp;#39;s Red Square. The ceremony
        begins at 1 p.m.</p>
       <p>More than 1300 students will receive their diplomas as an audience expected to number more
        than 5000 looks on.</p>
       <p>The college will confer bachelor of arts and bachelor of science degrees, as well as joint
        BA/BS degrees and masters degrees in teaching, public administration and environmental
        science.</p>
       <p>This academic year is one marked with <a
         href="http://www.evergreen.edu/news/releases/aug05/2006collegeguides.htm">extraordinary
         endorsements</a> of Evergreen&amp;#39;s academic challenge and student engagement
        &amp;#8212; notably, the college&amp;#39;s distinction as one of the most academically
        challenging colleges in the nation for freshman students and the high degree of student
        engagement. <a href="http://www.evergreen.edu/news/releases/nov05/nssetop10percent.htm">The
         National Survey of Student Engagement</a>, sponsored by the Carnegie Foundation for the
        Advancement of Teaching released their study highlighting Evergreen&amp;#39;s strengths last
        November.</p>
       <p><a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5283260" target="_blank"
         >National Public Radio featured Evergreen in February</a> as the only public college or
        university in America to be named as a &amp;quot;College That Changes Lives&amp;quot; by
        author Loren Pope.</p>
       <p>Evergreen president <a href="http://www.evergreen.edu/president/">Les Purce</a> says Gov.
        Gregoire delivering the commencement address is an honor for the college.
        &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m very pleased that the governor has accepted the invitation to speak at
        our 35th graduation. She has a distinguished record of support for public education - and an
        equally strong record of public service.&amp;quot;</p>

       <p>The Evergreen State College&amp;#8217;s Writer&amp;#39;s Guild is hosting the first-ever
        Spring Writes Writer&amp;#39;s Conference Saturday, May 6th from 9 a.m. to 6:30PM in the
        Cedar Room at the college&amp;#8217;s Longhouse Center. Tickets go on sale April 24th at the
        Evergreen Bookstore. Five dollars for students and $7 for community members. There is
        limited seating at the conference.</p>
       <p>Sandra Yannone, the director of Evergreen&amp;#8217;s writing center, will give a workshop
        on line breaks from 9AM to 10:30AM. Writing Poetry requires consummate juggling skills:
        attention to sound, metaphor, form, and individual words. In fact, writing poetry requires
        keeping so many balls in the air that a few tend to get overlooked in the blur of motion.
        Her workshop will focus on a key aspect of poetry, the line break. Yannone has published
        book reviews and poetry in Prairie Schooner, Ploughshares, Calyx, Connecticut Review, The
        Laurel Review and 13th Moon in addition to her poetry chapbook Top, published by Ultima
        Obscura Press. She is the recipient of the Academy of American Poets Prize.</p>
       <p>Steven Hendricks&amp;#39; workshop is called Structure Combinatorics and will run from
        10:45Am to 12:15PM. Drawing on concepts and methods employed by the Oulipo and in particular
        Italo Calvino, the workshop gives participants the opportunity to play with strategies for
        broad manipulations of narrative structures, to experiment with combinatorial approaches to
        developing fictions, and to use these methods to create new approaches to works-in-progress.
        Steven Hendricks is a visiting member of the faculty at The Evergreen State College. He
        teaches writing, book arts, and letterpress printing. Learn more about him at <a
         href="http://academic.evergreen.edu/h/hendrics/" target="_blank"
         >http://academic.evergreen.edu/h/hendrics/</a></p>
       <p>After a break for lunch, we&amp;#39;ll reinvigorate our brains and bodies with Painted
        Word from 1:30PM to 3PM. Paper, paint, and brushes will be available to explore the meaning
        of words through an action other than writing. Supplies for making altered books will also
        be available. Altered books are pieces where the artist takes an old book and uses it to
        tell a new story. The artist can use some or none of the original text and pictures. Paint,
        collage, string, and ink are a few of the objects used to alter books.</p>
       <p>Bill Ransom will lead us in the &amp;quot;50% Solution&amp;quot; from 3:15PM to 4:45PM.
        This workshop offers both poets and prose writers tips and exercises for effective revision
        of a fresh draft. Attention to a few very simple details pays excellent results in both
        styles. Bring rough drafts of your work or results of previous in-class writing exercises
        (from any writing workshop anywhere.) Bill Ransom is the author of six novels, six
        collections of poems, numerous short stories, and articles. His poetry was nominated for the
        Pulitzer Prize and the National Book Award. He is also teaches writing at The Evergreen
        State College. Learn more about him at <a href="http://www.sfwa.org/members/ransom"

       <p>2001 Evergreen alumnus and stand up comic Josh Blue is competing in the NBC reality series
         <em>Last Comic Standing</em> this summer. Blue was selected over hundreds of comics
        nationwide to join 11 others living and laughing on the cruise ship Queen Mary, where they
        will compete in various comedy contests to determine the top six, then the public will vote
        to choose the winner, who receives an exclusive talent contract with NBC and their own
        comedy special on the Bravo television network.</p>
       <p>A gifted stand-up comedian and U.S. Paralympic soccer player, Blue takes on the challenges
        that come from living with cerebral palsy with a smile. He jokes, &amp;quot;I realize that
        people are going to stare so I want to give them something to stare at.&amp;quot; His
        self-deprecating sense of humor defies stereotypes and encourages others to overcome their
        pre-conceived notions about disabled people.</p>
       <p>Blue was featured twice on Comedy Central&amp;#39;s <em>Mind of Mencia</em> in fall 2005,
        and also released his first CD, &amp;quot;Good Josh Bad Arm.&amp;quot;</p>
       <p>He got his start in comedy while pursuing a bachelor of arts degree in creative writing
        from The Evergreen State College. At the 2004 Las Vegas Comedy Festival, he won the $10,000
        Grand Prize at the Royal Flush Comedy Competition. In 2005, he earned rave reviews on the
        college circuit and a nomination for &amp;quot;Best Diversity Event of 2006.&amp;quot;</p>
       <p>Blue has opened for nationally known comics including Robert Schimmel, Kathleen Madigan,
        Richard Lewis, Tommy Davidson and Jake Johannsen.</p>
       <p>Despite his hectic career, Josh continues to be a member of the U.S. Paralympic Soccer
        Team. In September 2004 he competed at the Paralympic Games held in Athens, Greece.</p>
       <p>Blue lives in Denver, Colo. Learn more about him at <a href="http://www.joshblue.com/"

       <p>Magda Costantino, director of <a href="http://www.evergreen.edu/ecei/">The Evergreen State
         College&amp;#39;s Center for Educational Improvement</a>, received the 2005 Douglas
        Fellowship from the Washington State Historical Society at the group&amp;#39;s 115th annual
        meeting on June 17.</p>
       <p>The Douglas Fellowship is presented to a person or group of individuals who have made
        significant contributions to Washington state or local history.</p>
       <p>Costantino received the fellowship along with Denny Hurtado, who is the Indian Education
        Director for Washington&amp;#39;s Office of the Superintendent for Public Instruction.</p>
       <p>The two received the fellowship for their leadership of the Northwest Native American
        Reading Curriculum project. The project has been in classrooms for more than a year and
        features original materials developed by Indian writers, artists and educators.</p>
       <p>The project is based upon research both in bilingual education and a culturally relevant
        teaching style. The curriculum fosters reading and writing skills while it honors tradition,
        family and elders. The program is geared to incorporate images and concepts that Indian
        children can appreciate and non-Indian children can learn from.</p>
       <p>The society says Costantino and Hurtado have been &amp;quot;determined to make a
        difference and infuse both elementary and middle school curricula with authentic documents
        that provide a basis for exploring multiple perspectives of our state&amp;#39;s
        history.&amp;quot;</p>
       <p>Costantino is a native of the former Czechoslovakia and holds an M.A. in English and
        Spanish, a M.Ed. in Spanish and a Ph.D. in Curriculum and Instruction. Evergreen&amp;#39;s
        Center for Educational Improvement focuses on education reform in Washington and improving
        the learning of all children. The center&amp;#39;s work also focuses on issues of educating
        English language learners and Indian learners.</p>

       <p>June 1 , 2006</p>
       <p>With more than 15,000 expected at <a href="http://www.evergreen.edu/supersaturday/">Super
         Saturday</a>, parking will be near capacity around The Evergreen State College, but
        there&amp;#39;s a great way to beat the traffic!</p>
       <p>Intercity Transit is the best way to get to Super Saturday, with special park-and-ride
        service every 10 minutes between 10 a.m. and 6:30 p.m. The park-and-ride shuttle location is
        at the Department of Licensing building, 405 Black Lake Blvd. at 4th Avenue.</p>
       <p>Take the transit and get dropped off right at Red Square - the heart of the event. More
        than 4,000 riders take transit to and from Super Saturday.</p>
       <p>You can also take route 41 from downtown every 15 minutes - which will add an extra bus to
        its regular Saturday service. The bus departs the Olympia Transit Center in downtown Olympia
        and travels to Super Saturday along Division Street and Kaiser Road , picking up passengers
        along the way. Special service runs from 10:30 a.m. to 6:30 p.m.</p>
       <p>For more information about bus schedules, go to <a href="http://www.intercitytransit.com/"
         >www.intercitytransit.com</a> , or call their customer service center at 786-1881.</p>

       <p>STONY BROOK, N.Y. -- The American Society of Naturalists awarded Evergreen State College
        faculty member John Longino their highly prestigious E.O. Wilson Naturalist Award. The award
        recognizes individuals whose research and writing on a particular group of organisms also
        illuminates principles of evolutionary biology and an enhanced appreciation of natural
        history.</p>
       <p>Longino was awarded a plaque and a $2000 honorarium at the society&amp;#8217;s annual
        meeting. The American Society of Naturalists was established in 1883 and publishes the
        scientific journal The American Naturalist. Dedicated to the conceptual unification of the
        biological sciences, it is one of the most highly regarded scientific societies in the
        world.</p>
       <p>Longino began teaching at Evergreen in 1991, and holds a B.S. from Duke Univ. and a Ph.d.
        in zoology from the Univ. of Texas, Austin. He specializes and is widely known in the field
        of Myrmecology, the scientific study of ants. Longino&amp;#8217;s academic areas at
        Evergreen are ecology, entomology and evolution. He regularly teaches programs in Tropical
        Biology, taking students to Costa Rica to experience tropical rainforests first-hand. He
        blends teaching and research, often involving students in his research on tropical
        entomology.</p>
       <p>The award was established the year professor E.O. Wilson, widely considered one of the
        world&amp;#8217;s greatest scientists, retired from Harvard University. A two-time Pulitzer
        prize author and recipient of the National Medal of Science, Wilson has written more than 20
        books and discovered many new species. Longino himself has discovered over 45 new species of
        ants.</p>

       <p>Students at The Evergreen State College will see everything from a new student operated
        caf&amp;#233; to art galleries, an indoor waterfall and an amphitheatre performance space
        after a &amp;#39;yes&amp;#39; vote from enrolled students for a student fee that will
        significantly enhance the College Activities Building (CAB).</p>
       <p>Evergreen&amp;#8217;s Board of Trustees unanimously adopted the new $5.75 per credit fee
        July 12.</p>
       <p>The project will dramatically boost the appearance of the building and create a better
        connection to campus housing and student life. In total, the project will add 14,500 square
        feet to the CAB.</p>
       <p>The first complete renovation of the CAB in 35 years also provides major upgrades to the
        building&amp;#8217;s infrastructure &amp;#8211; including ventilation, heating, electrical
        systems and seismic upgrades. Funding for those components of the project is being requested
        from the state legislature.</p>
       <p>The new fee for the unique project was voted on by students Spring 2006. A 25%
        participation rate from the student body was required for validation and 27.6% of eligible
        students voted (1,155 total votes). 57% of those students voted in favor of a new fee. Three
        levels of fees, each with different levels of enhancements were voted on &amp;#8211;
        $3.35/credit, $4.25/credit, and $5.75/credit &amp;#8211; and the fee of $5.75/credit
        received the most votes.</p>
       <p>Besides including the most amenities, the $5.75 fee will ensure that the project is
        designed and built to the Leadership in Environmental Design commission&amp;#8217;s rare
        &amp;#8216;Gold&amp;#8217; standard, which the college&amp;#8217;s new Seminar II Building
        already holds.</p>
       <p>The college will begin collection of the new fee in Fall 2006 and legislative approval of
        state support of $4.9 million will be sought during the 2007 legislative session. Completion
        of the project is slated for 2010. The fee applies to Olympia campus students only.</p>

        <strong>Evergreen named only public college in the west that &amp;#39;changes

       </p>
       <p>
        <em>Washington&amp;#39;s liberal arts college one of only three schools in West to receive
         honor</em>
       </p>
       <p>A revised and expanded book by a former New York Times education editor features The
        Evergreen State College in Olympia, Wash. as one of two public institutions in the nation as
        a &amp;quot;College That Changes Lives.&amp;quot;</p>
       <p>The newly expanded and revised &amp;quot;Colleges That Change Lives: 40 Schools That Will
        Change the Way You Think About Colleges&amp;quot; addresses this era when college rankings
        and name-brand recognition seem to drive the search process, leaving many students, parents
        and counselors questioning the options for a good college match. Author Loren Pope educates
        families about their choices and profiles 40 colleges that excel at developing potential,
        values, initiative and risk-taking in a wide range of students. Evergreen was featured in
        early 2006 by National Public Radio as the nation&amp;#39;s only public college listed in
        the popular college guide.</p>
       <p>Pope, the author of Looking Beyond the Ivy League, believes that the college search should
        be focused on each student&amp;#39;s individual learning style and interests rather than on
        magazine rankings. This new edition not only re-examines colleges previously recognized, but
        also looks at college admission for homeschooled and learning disabled. Pope&amp;#39;s book
        specifically examines the life-long benefits of a liberal arts education for today&amp;#39;s
        students in this increasingly dynamic and technology driven world that we live in today. The
        book also provides information on the success of graduates from the 40 colleges.</p>
       <p>After careers as an education journalist and college administrator, author Loren Pope
        founded the College Placement Bureau. More than 100,000 copies of his book have been sold
        &amp;#8212; the revised and expanded edition is available nation wide for $15.</p>

       <p>Ed Sorger, a 35-year veteran of the Lacey Police Department has been appointed chief of
        police at The Evergreen State College. Sorger, who served in numerous roles with Lacey
        Police, has credentials that include the FBI National Academy for police administrators and
        an Executive Law Enforcement certification from the Washington Criminal Justice Training
        Commission.</p>
       <p>&amp;quot;Coming to Evergreen is a new chapter of my life that I&amp;#8217;m very excited
        about&amp;#8230;I&amp;#8217;m ready to use my background and experiences to manage a new
        police agency at a college campus that is like a small city in many ways,&amp;quot; Sorger
        says.</p>
       <p>Sorger says he will continue to strengthen relationships with other local law enforcement
        agencies and put energy into community oriented policing on and around the
        college&amp;#8217;s 1000 acre campus.</p>
       <p>Sorger is a native of Thurston County and is in his third term as a member of the Yelm
        Community School Board.<br/>

       <p>SEATTLE, Wash<strong>. &amp;#8211;</strong> All eyes will be on home plate at Safeco Field
        prior to Wednesday&amp;#8217;s Seattle Mariners game as the team welcomes The Evergreen
        State College&amp;#8217;s 2006-2007 Jackie Robinson Scholarship recipients.</p>
       <p>Just before the 7:05 p.m. start of the Aug. 30 game against the Los Angeles Angels,
        Evergreen President Les Purce and Seattle Central Community College President Mildred
        Oll&amp;#233;e will make their way to home plate to present scholarships to Lindi Coles of
        Richland and Emma Claire Lantz of Tacoma. These students, through their outstanding academic
        achievements and community involvement, exemplify the ideals of quality and acceptance
        demonstrated by Jackie Robinson throughout his trailblazing career.</p>
       <p>Coles, who graduated from Richland High School in 2001, is a senior at Evergreen studying
        social and cultural sciences. She is interested in pursuing a career in alternative medicine
        and hopes to own a private health care practice. Coles possesses a strong personal
        commitment to better society through good citizenship and community involvement, and
        volunteers with numerous organizations, including the Olympia School District. The Jackie
        Robinson Scholarship allows her to finish the final year of her degree program.</p>
       <p>Emma Claire Lantz graduated from Gig Harbor Henderson Bay High School in 1998. A junior at
        Evergreen, she studies education with an emphasis in counseling and psychology. Lantz
        volunteers with the Tacoma Sea Explorers, Tacoma Housing Authority and tutors in
        kindergarten classrooms. She received an Associate of Arts degree at Tacoma Community
        College. She has also worked with YMCA and Metro Parks of Tacoma with programs for at risk
        youth.</p>
       <p>Former Evergreen Provost Patrick Hill and his wife Maureen established the scholarship
        program in 1987, in memory of their parents. Today, the scholarship is a partnership between
        The Evergreen State College &amp;#8211; Washington&amp;#8217;s nationally known public
        liberal arts and sciences college &amp;#8211; and Seattle Central Community College, an
        educational partner whose students often transfer to Evergreen to complete their
        baccalaureate degrees.</p>
       <p>The scholarship program honors Jackie Robinson, the first African American to play Major
        League Baseball in 1947. Known as a courageous trailblazer and was recognized for his
        integrity and committed work ethic. Robinson died in 1972.</p>
       <p>Additional partners that support the scholarship program include The Kenneth and Marleen
        Alhadeff Charitable Foundation and the Mariners Care Foundation.</p>

       <p>Work to enhance a busy intersection on The Evergreen State College campus begins next
        week, and will run through early October.</p>
       <p>Intersection enhancements at the Driftwood Rd. and Overhulse Rd. intersection, near
        student housing and off-campus apartments, will improve pedestrian safety by re-aligning the
        roadway.</p>
       <p>The re-alignment will reduce pedestrian crossing distances and increase visibility for
        drivers. Sidewalks and enhanced roadway markings are also a part of the project.</p>
       <p>Other campus roadwork includes improvements for southbound traffic near the campus/county
        boundary at the south end of Evergreen Parkway.</p>
       <p>The current roadway design, a product of the early 1970&amp;#8217;s, anticipated a divided
        highway to Highway 101. Plans include straightening the abrupt curve in the roadway and
        constructing a more efficient roadway bank through the turn. Work will also include
        connecting the college&amp;#8217;s bicycle and pedestrian path to the county trail on the
        west side of the Parkway, decreasing the trail slope and improving the transition between
        the two paths.</p>
       <p>Improving safety for bicyclists is another project goal &amp;#8211; bicyclists riding on
        the south end of the parkway now encounter a portion of shoulder that is very narrow near
        the guardrail. This portion of the shoulder will be widened to a standard width.</p>
       <p>The parkway work is expected to begin September 10, and be completed in early October.</p>
       <p>Drivers can expect temporary detours or flaggers. For more information, call
        Evergreen&amp;#8217;s office of Facilities Services at 867-6700</p>

       <p>A new method of ranking colleges and universities is making headlines, and The Evergreen
        State College is one of the top 50 schools in the country on a unique list that is gaining
        popularity.</p>
       <p>Unlike other widely debated college ranking guides, like U.S. News and World Report, the
        Washington Monthly&amp;#39;s assessment of the nation&amp;#39;s colleges analyzes a broader
        area than just what the institutions are doing for individuals - it focuses on what colleges
        are doing for the nation.</p>
       <p>According to The Washington Monthly, a political magazine based in Washington, D.C., their
        new guide is &amp;#8220;for all Americans who are concerned about our institutions of higher
        learning. Are our colleges making good use of our tax dollars? Are they producing graduates
        who can keep our nation competitive in a changing world? Are they, in short, doing well by
        doing good?&amp;#8221;</p>
       <p>The magazine ranks Evergreen 47th among the thousands of the nation&amp;#8217;s college
        and universities.</p>
       <p>&amp;#8220;A commitment to public service and the public good is one of
        Evergreen&amp;#8217;s core values &amp;#8211;the Washington Monthly has clearly recognized
        that,&amp;#8221; said Les Purce, Evergreen&amp;#8217;s president.</p>
       <p>Washington Monthly editors examined indicators of how much a school is benefiting the
        country through &amp;#8220;how well they perform as an engine of social mobility, ideally
        helping the poor to get rich rather than the very rich to get very, very rich, how well the
        institutions do in fostering scientific and humanistic research, and how well they promote
        an ethic of service to country.&amp;#8221;</p>

       <p>WASHINGTON CASCADES -- Hanging by a thin rope at the top of a 30 story, 900 year old tree
        is just another day in the office for Evergreen State College professor Nalini Nadkarni.</p>
       <p>It&amp;#39;s a world that few see.</p>
       <p>&amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s a magical feeling...you can&amp;#39;t even see the
        ground,&amp;quot; Nadkarni says, &amp;quot;the sounds and sights are amazing.&amp;quot;</p>
       <p>Dr. Nadkarni and other researchers from The Evergreen State College in Olympia, Wash. are
        gearing up for the Canopy Confluence, a research and outreach project focusing on the upper
        forest canopy, a world that until recently, was largely unexplored.</p>
       <p>Nadkarni was one of the first researchers to study the forest canopy and made some of the
        first discoveries, like how trees extend their roots into the arboreal soil - hundreds of
        feet up -a soil generated by the 70 different species of moss that grow on tree
        branches.</p>
       <p>&amp;quot;The world of the canopy is different than the forest floor,&amp;quot; Nadkarni
        says, &amp;quot;one tree can host up to 60 or 70 species of moss, whereas there are only 15
        or 20 species of ground rooted plants.&amp;quot;</p>
       <p>Among Nadkarni&amp;#39;s most impressive discoveries was that roots from trees can grow
        out of branches, as well as development of new drugs from plants that only grow in the
        treetops.</p>
       <p>But Nadkarni&amp;#39;s work isn&amp;#39;t only about roots, moss and medicine.</p>
       <p>Nadkarni says there&amp;#39;s a huge amount of carbon, a gas critical to Earth&amp;#39;s
        biosphere, stored in the canopy. She says canopy research has huge implications for the
        study of global climate change - an issue becoming more and more on the thoughts of everyday
        America.</p>
       <p>From climate change to bird behavior and sustainability, the team&amp;#39;s work has broad
        meaning for the public- one of the things that researchers are now required to document and
        study for National Science Foundation grants, which has awarded the group more than $1.4
        million.</p>
       <p>Along with Evergreen students, Nadkarni and co-principal investigator Dr. Judy Cushing, a
        computer science faculty member at Evergreen and staff member Anne Fiala are developing a
        Canopy Database system so that data collected around the world about forest canopies can be
        centralized and standardized, work that will only help the relatively new study of
        canopies.</p>
       <p>From August 13 through 24, the trio will bring together eight forest canopy ecologists
        from other institutions that will collect data on a variety of scientific projects from
        field sites on the western side of the Washington Cascades, with trees ranging from 100 to
        1000 years old at Wind River, 60 miles east of Portland, Ore., and Cedar Flats, 70 miles
        northeast of Portland.</p>
       <p>But that&amp;#39;s not the unique part.</p>
       <p>A group of artists will also be a part of the work. Poets, dancers, songwriters and
        painters, funded by the National Geographic Society, will join the cadre of ecologists in
        the field to interpret the ecology of the forest canopy and the way scientists work, which
        they will later disseminate to their audiences at poetry readings, dance performances, music
        concerts and art exhibitions.</p>
       <p>The cutting edge science being carried out, the unique joining of scientists and artists
        in the field, and the rich possibility of materials that the venue and participants will
        create make it a unique research program - one of many for which The Evergreen State
        College, a public liberal arts and sciences college in Olympia, Wash., is widely known.</p>
       <p>The project includes undergraduate and graduate students and researchers say it&amp;#39;s
        globally important research that will connect with everyday people though art.</p>
       <p>Another effort of Nadkarni&amp;#39;s is to build a forest canopy walkway system in the
        treetops of the campus forests so that everyone - from toddlers to octogenarians - will have
        access to the amazing world. Progress on that project is dependant on private fundraising,
        and there is growing momentum to make that happen. The canopy walkways would be installed on
        the 1000 acre forested campus that sits on Washington&amp;#39;s Puget Sound.</p>
       <p>At the research sites, scientists will carry out projects that include identifying disease
        and virus transmissions from animals by trapping vertebrates who spend their entire life
        cycles in the trees and are very poorly known.</p>
       <p>Among other aspects, researchers will quantify and make visualizations of the
        &amp;quot;air space&amp;quot; in the forest using new technology that links laser
        rangefinders with palm pilots to enhance data collection efficiency when hanging on ropes in
        the canopy, assessing the effects of host tree species on the biodiversity of moss
        communities and relating bird diversity to forest structure as stands develop through
        time.</p>
       <p>Evergreen students will be carrying out projects involving ash from the 1980 eruption of
        Mt. St. Helens that can still be found under moss and performing a census of tree branches
        and comparing that to a census from five years ago.</p>
       <p>Narkarni is one of the pioneers in forest canopy research. &amp;quot;I make sure my
        climbing harness is on correctly and I&amp;#39;m all ready to go,&amp;quot; she says.</p>

       <p>2001 Evergreen alumnus and stand up comic Josh Blue is now one of only three comics that
        America will select as NBC's Last Comic Standing. The program airs Tuesdays at 9 p.m.
        Pacific, and viewers can vote for their favorite comic online or by phone. The competition
        was narrowed to the three comedians after the August 1 broadcast.</p>
       <p>"Just the overnight fame is ridiculous," Blue told NBC on July 31. The winner of the
        series - the Last Comic Standing - receives an exclusive contract from the network as well
        as a comedy series on the Bravo network.</p>
       <p>Blue got his start in comedy while pursuing a bachelor of arts degree in creative writing
        from The Evergreen State College. At the 2004 Las Vegas Comedy Festival, he won the $10,000
        Grand Prize at the Royal Flush Comedy Competition. In 2005, he earned rave reviews on the
        college circuit and a nomination for "Best Diversity Event of 2006."</p>
       <p>A gifted stand-up comedian and U.S. Paralympic soccer player, Blue takes on the challenges
        that come from living with cerebral palsy with a smile. He jokes, "I realize that people are
        going to stare so I want to give them something to stare at." His self-deprecating sense of
        humor defies stereotypes and encourages others to overcome their pre-conceived notions about
        disabled people.</p>
       <p>Blue was featured twice on Comedy Central's Mind of Mencia in fall 2005, and also released
        his first CD, "Good Josh Bad Arm."</p>
       <p>Blue has opened for nationally known comics including Robert Schimmel, Kathleen Madigan,
        Richard Lewis, Tommy Davidson and Jake Johannsen.</p>
       <p>Despite his hectic career, Josh continues to be a member of the U.S. Paralympic Soccer
        Team. In September 2004 he competed at the Paralympic Games held in Athens, Greece. Blue is
        a resident of Denver, Colo.<br/>

       <p>NEW YORK - Native American programs at The Evergreen State College will receive a
        significant boost with a quarter-million dollar grant from the Ford Foundation.</p>
       <p>The $250,000 award highlights Evergreen&amp;#8217;s extensive Native American educational
        and cultural programs - a commitment widely acclaimed as one of the strongest in the
        nation.</p>
       <p>The funding allows the college&amp;#8217;s Longhouse Education and Cultural Center a new
        opportunity to broaden educational programs and become a national resource for Native
        artists by expanding funding for the center&amp;#8217;s notable Artist-In-Residence program.
        The Longhouse has also joined the IllumiNation initiative, a nationwide Native art program,
        partnering with organizations including the Smithsonian National Museum of the American
        Indian, thanks to the grant funding.</p>
       <p>&amp;#8220;The staff and supporters of the Longhouse are really looking forward to this
        new opportunity to expand our existing programs and become a national resource for Native
        artists,&amp;#8221; said Tina Kuckkahn, Director of the Longhouse Center. The center is
        housed on campus in the first Native American Longhouse constructed at a public college or
        university in the nation. Evergreen&amp;#8217;s Longhouse has served as a model for several
        universities.</p>
       <p>The grant funding also boosts programs for Evergreen students studying Native Arts
        Administration as a part of the college&amp;#8217;s Native American undergraduate studies.
        In addition to the undergraduate studies, the college has a Master of Public Administration
        in Tribal Governance program, which is unique in the nation.</p>
       <p>The Ford Foundation was created by Henry and Edsel Ford in 1936 and is focused on
        strengthening democratic values, reducing poverty and injustice, promoting international
        cooperation and advancing human achievement.</p>

       <h2>College&amp;#39;s E.Coli research also featured nationally</h2>
       <br/>

       <p>OLYMPIA &amp;#8211; In a week where cutting-edge E.Coli research based at The Evergreen
        State College has been featured by regional and national media, funding from a National
        Science Foundation grant will award $100,000 in scholarships per academic year to students
        studying science at the college.</p>
       <p>The funding, announced this week, will allow Evergreen to award the need-based
        scholarships each academic year through 2011 &amp;#8211; averaging about 20 students per
        year.</p>
       <p>The NSF grant program &amp;#8211; Scholarships in Science, Technology, Engineering and
        Mathematics &amp;#8211; also provides the college with funding to provide additional
        academic and student support services for science students.</p>
       <p><a href="http://www.evergreen.edu/faculty/sfaculty.htm#schofp">Dr. Paula Schofield</a>, a
        chemistry professor at Evergreen, who leads the project as principal investigator, says that
        the award will help more students finish college.</p>
       <p>&amp;#8220;This grant enables students who are financially needy and show academic
        potential the unique opportunity to study interdisciplinary laboratory sciences at The
        Evergreen State College, without incurring the financial burden associated with going to
        college,&amp;#8221; Schofield said.</p>
       <p>Earlier in the week, Evergreen&amp;#8217;s Phage Laboratory was featured around the nation
        for their breakthrough &amp;#8211; harmlessly killing E.Coli at its natural source: inside
        the animals that harbor it.</p>
       <p>Evergreen and the NSF both place a high priority on bringing more underrepresented
        students into the scholarship program&amp;#8217;s disciplines.</p>

       <p>A 27-year-old&amp;#160; Evergreen student studying fine arts, ecology and agriculture has
        been appointed student trustee at The Evergreen State College by Gov. Chris Gregoire.</p>
       <p>Evergreen senior Jay Carmony began his one-year term in August, and says he&amp;#39;s
        excited to serve on the college&amp;#39;s board of trustees.</p>
       <p>&amp;quot;Evergreen has changed my life for the positive, and I wanted to be a part of
        something larger than myself in order to give back,&amp;quot; Carmony says.&amp;#160;</p>
       <p>Carmony says his goals as a member of the board include serving as an effective
        communication link between the board of trustees and the developing student government, as
        well&amp;#160; as p roviding important feedback to the board.</p>
       <p>Carmony graduated from high school in 1997 in Wooster, Ohio and began studying geology at
        Ohio State Univ. He found Evergreen through national rankings the college received and
        noticed &amp;#160;the positive&amp;#160; media attention that Evergreen garners.</p>
       <p>&amp;quot;You can&amp;#39;t always find cross subject learning and conventional
        universities.I left Ohio State and came to the school that I always wanted to go
        to,&amp;quot; Carmony said.</p>
       <p>Carmony currently lives in Olympia and volunteers at Left Foot Organics, a non-profit
        &amp;quot;working farm&amp;quot; that supports individuals who are disabled.</p>
       <p>The Evergreen State College Board of Trustees is an eight-member governing board appointed
        by the governor, and provides the college with its long-term strategic leadership.</p>
       <p>The BOT directs Evergreen into the future, initiates policy and delegates authority to the
        president, who reports to the board.</p>
       <p>The Evergreen State College is Washington state&amp;#39;s nationally known public liberal
        arts and sciences college. Located in Olympia, Washington, the college offers Bachelor of
        Arts and Bachelor of Science degrees, as well three master&amp;#39;s level degrees. The
        college&amp;#39;s enrollment is nearly 4500.</p>

       <p>The southbound lane of Evergreen Parkway will be closed at the roundabout at the main
        college entrance 24 Friday, Oct. 27 through Nov. 10.</p>
       <p>Motorists can follow a marked detour off of the parkway and onto Overhulse Rd. NW, then to
        17th Ave. NW for access to highway 101. Northbound traffic on the parkway will not be
        affected, and southbound access to the college will not be affected.</p>
       <p>The closure comes at the request of the contractor straightening an abrupt curve in the
        roadway and constructing a more efficient roadway bank through the turn. Work will also
        include connecting the college&amp;#39;s bicycle and pedestrian path to the county trail on
        the west side of the Parkway, decreasing the trail slope and improving the transition
        between the two paths.</p>

         >www.evergreen.edu/news</a>. For more information call College Engineer Rich Davis at

       <h2>
        <em>Memorial Media Fund created in her honor</em>
       </h2>
       <p>A campus memorial service for Marge Brown, a popular staff and faculty member who passed
        away July 9, 2006, is planned for Sunday, October 29, 2006 at 1 p.m. at The Evergreen State
        College&amp;#39;s Longhouse Education and Cultural Center.</p>
       <p>Marge passed away after fighting cancer for the past few years. Her contributions to the
        Evergreen community were important and substantial, and the excellent relationships she
        enjoyed with co-workers, students and faculty colleagues are an indication of how important
        she has been to the community.</p>
       <p>At various times, Marge was a student, staff member and faculty member. She started her
        work in Media Services as a student employee in 1977 and became a classified staff member in
        1979. She worked in Media Loan, Photo Production Services and most recently in Electronic
        Media. Since 1990 she has been the Electronic Media Producer in charge of video productions
        at Evergreen. She taught in many academic classes over the years and each summer she offered
        her very popular Experimental Animation Techniques program. Other courses that Marge taught
        included Space/Time/Imagination, Video Production and Introduction to Media
        Presentation.</p>
       <p>Marge was also extremely active in the local independent media community. She was a member
        of Wovie, Inc. and a co-producer of their film, &amp;quot;Group,&amp;quot; which made its
        commercial debut in New York City in 2002.</p>
       <p>The Margery B. Brown Memorial Media Fund has been created through The Evergreen State
        College Foundation to support the student oriented teaching and production work in which
        Marge invested so much of her life at Evergreen. This fund will support students interested
        in researching, producing and supporting socially relevant, experimental and critical media.
        The fund will provide annual production stipends, scholarships, and resources for expanding
        the college&amp;#39;s animation collection. An annual application process will be
        administered by staff and faculty in media, and awards will be based on need and thematic
        content. Donations can be made at the college foundation&amp;#39;s secure giving site at <a

       <p>Lynn Patterson, faculty emeritus at The Evergreen State College, has been awarded a

        at the Babes-Bolyai University, the U.S. Department of State and the J. William Fulbright
        Foreign Scholar Board announced.</p>
       <p>Patterson is one of approximately 800 U.S. faculty and professionals who will travel
        abroad to more than 150 countries during the 2006-2007 academic year through the Fulbright
        program. Established in 1946, the program works to build mutual understanding between the
        people of the U.S. and other nations.</p>
       <p>Recipients of Fulbright Scholar awards are selected on the basis of academic or
        professional achievement and because they have demonstrated extraordinary leadership
        potential in their fields, according to the Department of State.</p>
       <p>The program honors Fulbright, the late U.S. Senator from Arkansas.</p>
       <p>Patterson, a longtime faculty member at the Evergreen, left Sept. 20 and returns to the
        U.S. in February.</p>

       <p><strong>OLYMPIA</strong><strong>, Wash.</strong> &amp;#8211; The Evergreen State College
        women&amp;#39;s soccer team will face Concordia University on back to back weekends as both
        teams advanced from the Cascade Conference Tournament to the NAIA Region I Tournament. The
        tournament is a one day event that begins Friday afternoon at 11:00 AM on
        Concordia&amp;#39;s campus in Portland, OR.</p>
       <p>Evergreen enters the tournament as the fourth seed among the four participating teams.
        Concordia is ranked number one and ranked number three in the NAIA. It&amp;#39;s not an
        enviable position for the Geoducks, but a position they can be proud to be in
        nonetheless.</p>
       <p>Last Saturday Evergreen lost to Concordia University 0-4 in a game where they were held to
        just one shot during the game. The play status of senior forward Alice Dietz remains to be
        determined as Coaches Luise Frank and John Purtteman appeal a questionable red card ruling
        against Dietz in last Saturday&amp;#39;s game. If the call stands, the team would be without
        one of their key players.</p>

       <p>The Evergreen State College&amp;#39;s fourth annual Pete Steilberg Cross Country Open will
        play host to the defending national champions Saturday, Oct. 21.</p>
       <p>Concordia University of Portland, Club Northwest and open runners will also make up the
        field of entrants.</p>
       <p>The Evergreen women&amp;#39;s team is led by freshman Kelly Beckham who finished 12th
        overall at the Warner-Cascade meet last week. The men&amp;#8217;s team has the one-two punch
        of Bryan Rakestraw and James Hudson as their frontrunners.</p>
       <p>Event headquarters is at the pavilion located near the main soccer field on
        Evergreen&amp;#39;s campus, and packet pickup begins at 8:30 a.m. The women&amp;#39;s 5k
        race begins at 10 a.m., and the men&amp;#39;s 8k at 10:45 a.m.</p>
       <p>The multi-loop course will be a combination of groomed grass fields, hard-packed dirt and
        small sections of primitive grass trail. Some small sections of asphalt in road crossings
        and hay bale barriers. There is one short, steep hill.</p>
       <p>For registration, to volunteer, or for more information, call Evergreen cross country and
        track and field coach Craig Dickson at 360-867-6741. Day of event entries are not
        accepted.</p>
       <p>The race honors Pete Steilberg, the college&amp;#39;s long-time director of athletics and
        recreation who retired in 1999.</p>

       </p>
       <p>During three decades of intense art making, Louise Williams explored the expressionistic
        rendering of the human figure. Subject matter ranged from dark and macabre to endearing and
        sweet, from deploring crimes against humanity and oppression of women to celebrating family
        and the realm of fantasy. The original Collected Stories folding books created by Louise
        Williams and Tacoma artist Becky Frehse are also on display in the Library.</p>

        will temporarily reopen to motorists the afternoon of Friday, Nov. 16.<br/> Due to extreme
        weather conditions and history-making heavy rain during the past two weeks, the project has
        been delayed.</p>
       <p>The contractor, Harlow Construction, will reopen the road with crushed rock which will
        limit the speed limit to 20 m.p.h. Harlow will apply asphalt as soon as weather conditions
        allow. The temporary gravel will allow better drainage on the site, and signage will be
        installed noting the temporary speed limit.</p>
       <p>The completed project will straighten an abrupt curve in the roadway and construct a more
        efficient roadway bank through the turn. Work also includes connecting the college&amp;#39;s
        bicycle and pedestrian path to the county trail on the west side of the Parkway, decreasing
        the trail slope and improving the transition between the two paths.</p>
       <p>For project updates, go to <a href="http://www.evergreen.edu/news/"
         >www.evergreen.edu/news</a>.<br/> For more information call College Engineer Rich Davis at
        867-6136</p>

       <p align="left">The Evergreen State College&amp;#8217;s Center for Educational Improvement
        has received $85,000 from the Pacific Science Center and the State Superintendent of Public
        Instruction to enhance training for south sound K-12 science teachers.</p>
       <p>The grant will provide funding for teacher training in inquiry-based science and creating
        a better understanding of how students can apply science to their everyday world.</p>
       <p>About 1500 teachers in nine local school districts will take part in the program.</p>
       <p>&amp;#8220;Teachers tend to teach the way they were taught. Most science teachers learned
        science from a lecture and lab model of teaching and learning. Inquiry based science is much
        different. It is designed to have students learn by asking questions and discovering the
        answers through &amp;#8220;doing&amp;#8221; science,&amp;#8221; said Richard Britz,
        assistant director of the Educational Improvement center.</p>
       <p>The nine school districts included in the program serve 12% of the state&amp;#8217;s K-12
        population, or about 122,000 students.</p>
       <p>The school districts include Bethel, Clover Park, Franklin Pierce, North Thurston,
        Olympia, Puyallup, Steilacoom, Tacoma and Yelm.</p>

       <p>OLYMPIA, Wash. - A national study says The Evergreen State College is one of the
        nation&amp;#8217;s most academically challenging - and a top college for the level of active
        and collaborative learning for students.</p>
       <p>The study, founded by the Pew Charitable Trusts, says Evergreen students develop top
        abilities in analyzing theories and ideas and spend more time preparing for classes and
        reading textbooks.</p>
       <p>Evergreen students also spend more time making class presentations and working with other
        students on projects than most of the nation&amp;#8217;s college students. Evergreen
        freshman and seniors cite the remarkable quality of interaction with faculty members and
        other students and the campus physical environment as keys to success.</p>
       <p>&amp;#8220;This national study again confirms what we have known for some time.
        Evergreen&amp;#8217;s students receive an extraordinary education that prepares them to
        engage with real-world issues in a changing world,&amp;#8221; said Thomas L. Purce,
        Evergreen&amp;#8217;s president</p>
       <p>Unlike many other college ranking systems, the study focuses on putting more emphasis into
        successful student learning and high quality research. In September, a federal Higher
        Education Commission directed that colleges and universities should be measured by
        meaningful student learning outcomes.</p>
       <p>260,000 college students at 523 U.S. universities participated in the National Survey of
        Student Engagement.</p>
       <p>&amp;#8220;For years, researchers have pointed to involvement in educationally purposeful
        activities as the gateway to desired outcomes of college. Students who engage more
        frequently in educationally effective get better grades, are more satisfied and are more
        likely to persist,&amp;#8221; says George Kuh, the director of the survey.</p>
       <p>Founded in 1967 as an alternative to traditional education, The Evergreen State College in
        Olympia, Wash. is a top example of interdisciplinary education in America. Academic studies
        are organized into interdisciplinary learning communities focused on specific themes with
        real-world relevance. Evergreen was recently featured as one of only two public colleges in
        the book &amp;#8220;Colleges That Changes Lives.,&amp;#8221; and named as a
        &amp;#8220;College that is doing good for the nation&amp;#8221; by the Washington Monthly
        political magazine.</p>

       <p align="left">Robin Blaser, a well known Canadian poet will give a talk at The Evergreen
        State College Nov. 27 at 7 p.m. in the Seminar II Building, room A 1105.</p>
       <p>Blaser has developed as a writer through subsequent generations and poetic movements, and
        his work now extends beyond the era in which it began. An immigrant to Vancouver, B.C. in
        1966, and a Canadian citizen since 1972, Blaser has established himself as a key figure on
        the west coast of B.C. and an important influence among Canadian experimental poets such as
        George Bowering, Steve McCaffery, bp Nichol, Erin Moure, and Daphne Marlatt.</p>
       <p>In 2000, he published a libretto for The Last Supper, an opera with music by British
        composer Sir Harrison Birtwistle. Currently, he is completing Collected Essays and an
        expanded edition of The Holy Forest that will include a new book of poems. Other recent
        titles include Wanders (2002) and The Irreperable (2003).</p>
       <p>In addition, Blaser has published numerous essays on poetics, including &amp;quot;The
        Fire,&amp;#8221; which was anthologized in The Poetics of the New American Poetry (1974),
        and &amp;quot;The Practice of Outside,&amp;#8221; which accompanies his edition of The
        Collected Books of Jack Spicer (1980).</p>
       <p>Blaser&amp;#8217;s appearance is free and open to the public. Campus parking is $1.25. For
        more information, call 867-5412.</p>

         <em>Evergreen responds to Centralia mine closure</em>
        </strong>
       </p>
       <p>In the wake of the closure of the Centralia coal mine by TransAlta Corp., The Evergreen
        State College is making tuition waivers of variable amounts up to $1200 and academic support
        available to displaced mine employees, the college announced.</p>
       <p>&amp;quot;The closure of the mine in Centralia impacts thousands of people, and
        we&amp;#39;re here to assist in any way we can,&amp;quot; said Thomas L. Purce,
        Evergreen&amp;#39;s president. &amp;quot;We are committed to being responsive to the needs
        of our community and the state,&amp;quot; he said.</p>
       <p>Tuition waivers from $300 to $1200 a quarter will be made available, along with academic
        guidance. Evergreen is also working with Centralia College to create an agreement for the
        Associate in Technical Arts in Power Operations, allowing students who graduate with that
        degree at Centralia and who meet the program&amp;#39;s criteria, to make a seamless
        transition to Evergreen with junior standing and 90 credits.</p>
       <p>The mine&amp;#39;s closure was announced Monday, Nov. 27.</p>
       <p>For more information about tuition waivers, transferring community college credit, or for
        general information about enrolling at The Evergreen State College call 360-867-6310 or
        e-mail elhardtm@evergreen.edu.</p>
       <p>The Evergreen State College is Washington&amp;#39;s nationally acclaimed public
        baccalaureate liberal arts and sciences college located in Olympia. For more information, go

       <p>Four faculty members at The Evergreen State College are the first recipients of the Tom
        Rye Harvill award, providing $5,000 to explore art and science through visual arts,
        literature, multimedia, dance and theatre.</p>
       <p>Faculty Judy Cushing, Ruth Hayes, David McAvity and Richard Weiss were selected for the
        2006 award.<br/>
        <br/> Evergreen alumnus Young Harvill &amp;#39;76 created the award to honor his late
        father, Tom, an electronics engineer, poet, technical writer, early computer operator, radio
        enthusiast and stargazer.</p>
       <p>A biography of Tom Harvill explains that he &amp;quot;read a lot, did a lot, and was great
        at synthesizing big concepts from detail. He used this in his poetry, and in day-to-day
        conversation. He was great to talk with because he was always engaged and interested in some
        new connection, some new way of looking at the world.&amp;quot; Tom Harvill died in
        1997.</p>
       <p>The faculty will use the award for the collaborative development of three-dimensional
        animated models of forest canopies; data for their project will come from
        Evergreen&amp;#39;s nationally featured Forest Canopy Database Project.</p>
       <p>The Tom Rye Harvill award is&amp;#160;awarded annually. Competitions take place in
        February and are open to Evergreen faculty, staff and alumni.<br/>

         <em>Severe weather causes delay with project</em>
        </strong>
       </p>
       <p>The southbound lane of Evergreen Parkway will be closed at the roundabout at the main
        college entrance through Monday, Dec. 11.</p>
       <p>Improving weather conditions should allow paving to occur Thursday, Dec. 7. The work
        should be substantially complete by Monday Dec. 11. The project has been delayed due to
        severe weather that occurred in November - wet and wintry conditions that prevented asphalt
        from being applied.</p>
       <p>Motorists can follow a marked detour off of the parkway and onto Overhulse Rd. NW, then to
        17th Ave. NW for access to highway 101. Northbound traffic on the parkway will not be
        affected, and southbound access to the college will not be affected.</p>
       <p>The project straightens an abrupt curve in the roadway and constructs a more efficient
        roadway bank through the turn. Work will also include connecting the college&amp;#39;s
        bicycle and pedestrian path to the county trail on the west side of the Parkway and
        improving the transition between the two paths.</p>
       <p>For project updates, go to <a href="http://www.evergreen.edu/news"
         >www.evergreen.edu/news</a>. For more information call College Engineer Rich Davis at
        867-6136</p>

   <title>President, Les Purce “GSU resolutions on divestment from Israel and boycott of

   <page-xhtml>
    <p>I have received the Geoduck Student Union's resolutions on divestment from Israel and
     boycotting Caterpillar. I would like to attend a meeting of the GSU to share with you my
     thinking about these resolutions and to hear your questions and ideas.</p>
    <p>As you know, this is not the first time these issues have come before me at Evergreen. The
     responsibility for the overall operation of the college, including college investments, rests
     with me as the president. In the interest of transparency, through this letter I want to let
     you know my thinking on these issues and share some information about the college's investment
     and purchasing practices.</p>
    <p>As an academic institution, the college has a fundamental reason to refrain from taking
     political positions. On political questions, the college's primary duties are to defend the
     right of its members to freely debate and question all political propositions and to encourage
     and facilitate discussion on difficult issues. If the college declares an institutionally
     preferred point of view on a political question, our role as a facilitator of difficult
     discussions is compromised. Also, Evergreen is a public college, established by the State of
     Washington, and it operates within the political and legal constraints that come with being a
     public entity. Reflecting these reasons, Evergreen's long-standing Social Contract includes the
     provision that 'the college is obligated not to take a position, as an institution, in
     electoral politics or on public issues except for those matters which directly affect its
     integrity, the freedom of the members of its community, its financial support and its
     educational programs."</p>
    <p>While this principle from the Social Contract is important, I recognize that it does not
     necessarily end the discussion and that it often places the college in an awkward position.
     Political questions are, fundamentally, moral questions about how we construct a just society.
     Achieving social justice through education and public service is part of Evergreen's mission.
     At the same time, we emphasize civic engagement and urge students to carry theoretical and
     academic work into practice. While we teach students that they have a duty to become informed
     about political questions, form opinions, and act on those opinions, the college as an
     institution refrains from doing so. Instead, the college provides a place for all voices,
     including minority opinions.</p>
    <p>In an effort to help us all become informed, I want to provide some additional information
     about the administrative functions addressed in the GSU resolution. The great majority of the
     college's investments are held in short-term certificates of deposit (CDs) or in the state's
     Local Government Investment Pool. In addition, in a few cases where public money has been
     contributed to an endowment, the college holds the public part of the endowment in stocks and
     bonds. The responsibility for overseeing these investments is delegated to the Vice President
     for Finance and Administration.</p>
    <p>The college's purchasing and contracting authority is also governed by state law and the
     state's purchasing policies. Under these rules, when the college seeks to buy services or
     equipment, we are very limited in our ability to specify or restrict brands or manufacturers.
     The college does not have the authority to prohibit Caterpillar from responding to our requests
     for bids or to prevent our contractors or vendors from using Caterpillar equipment.</p>
    <p>Money raised on behalf of the college, held by The Evergreen State College Foundation, is in
     fact held by an independent non-profit corporation with the sole purpose of supporting students
     and programs at The Evergreen State College. The independent status of the foundation allows it
     to maintain a favorable tax status and to make and accept gifts -- including student
     scholarships, faculty development grants and other discretionary money -- that the college
     cannot. The Foundation is governed by an independent Board of Governors. For this reason, I
     cannot speak for the Foundation board. However, I do know that the Foundation board, which is
     made up of alumni and supporters of the college, has a long history of engaging in thoughtful
     and practical discussions about their investment practices.</p>
    <p>I have been moved by the eloquence and deep concern of the students and others who have urged
     the college to change its investment and purchasing practices. I have also heard from students
     and others who have a differing point of view. As you recognize, our community is divided on
     these questions. I believe that all those I have talked to share a genuine desire for peace and
     justice and that the disagreement is about the means to achieve those ends and the college's
     role in furthering those means.</p>
    <p>In this situation, I believe that Evergreen is called on to do what we do best: focus on
     teaching and learning, facilitating engaged dialogue in a community that listens attentively to
     divergent points of view and cares for all its members. I hope that we can work together to
     ensure that Evergreen can live up to our core educational responsibilities.</p>
    <p>As a step in that direction, I ask that you join me in two actions. First, I'd like to talk
     with you about how we, as a college, can expand and deepen our ongoing efforts to engage in
     difficult dialogues about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in a way that grapples with the
     complexity of the issues, acknowledges the full history of both peoples, and allows for all
     voices to be heard in honest and civil discourse. Second, for that part of the endowment that
     is held by the college, I am asking the Vice President for Finance and Administration to
     undertake a review over the course of this academic year of our investment policy (which has
     not been updated since 1993), examining best practices for socially responsible institutional
     investing and proposing any changes to our investment policy that may be warranted, consistent
     with the role of the college as a public institution and consistent with a goal of maximizing
     the long-term benefit for the scholarships and faculty development initiatives that the
     endowment supports.</p>
    <p>Both of these actions, to be successful, will require involvement from students, faculty and
     staff. In addition to meeting with the GSU, I plan to meet with members of the TESC Divest, and
     I am asking for time with the Faculty Agenda Committee.</p>

    <p>Dear Geoduck Student Union:</p>
    <p>As co-chairs of the Board of Trustees, we want to respond to the GSU's resolutions calling
     for divestment from Israel and a boycott of Caterpillar.</p>
    <p>The Board of Trustees has fiduciary responsibility for investments held by the college and
     oversees the college's financial management through regular review of financial reports and
     audits. The Board delegates to the President the authority and responsibility for investments
     and purchasing, the areas addressed by the GSU resolutions. Neither the Board of Trustees nor
     the college president has authority over investments held by The Evergreen State College
     Foundation. President Purce's previous response to the GSU described this state of affairs in
     some detail.</p>
    <p>Over the past six months, the Board has received extensive public comment on the GSU
     resolutions and related topics, both in our public meetings and in writing. Some of the comment
     we heard urged the Board to include formal consideration of the GSU resolutions as part of a
     future Board agenda. Board meeting agendas are set by the Board chairs in consultation with the
     President.</p>
    <p>The Board's long-standing delegation gives the President the responsibility for the college
     investments and purchasing. We do not intend to revisit the delegation, so do not plan to add
     discussion of the GSU resolutions to our agenda. President Purce's response to the resolutions
     is the college's formal response. President Purce met with the GSU to discuss his response and
     he would welcome further discussion. He can be contacted at purcel@evergreen.edu.</p>
    <p>We have appreciated the opportunity to hear from multiple points of view and to witness the
     profound commitment by Evergreen's students and faculty to learning and social justice.
     Clearly, these are difficult issues about which many points of view exist on campus. We want to
     thank the GSU for its work to advance this discussion at Evergreen. We take the issue very
     seriously and are proceeding in a thoughtful manner, as is our responsibility to the college
     and our students.</p>
    <p>We understand from President Purce's report to us at the last Board meeting that he has
     instructed the Vice President for Finance and Administration to propose an update to the
     college&amp;#700;s investment policy and that the Provost is working with faculty to develop
     the educational opportunities opened up by the GSU's resolutions. We believe that the steps
     President Purce and Provost Tabbutt are taking are the best course of action for Evergreen.</p>
    <p>Sincerely,</p>
    <p>Irene Gonzales, Ed.D., Co-Chair<br/> Anne Proffitt, '76, Co-Chair</p>

    <p>submission to Cooper Point Journal, May 31, 2011</p>
    <p>As the co-chairs of the Board of Trustees, we want to respond to the open letter addressed to
     the Board in the May 19 issue of the Cooper Point Journal.</p>
    <p>Almost a year ago, the Geoduck Student Union's representative to the Board shared with us the
     results of student resolutions calling for divestment from companies profiting from the
     Israel-Palestine conflict and a boycott of Caterpillar. The GSU representative also shared with
     us the GSU's related resolutions.</p>
    <p>Since then, the GSU's representative to the Board has re-emphasized these resolutions and we
     have heard dozens of people make public comment on these resolutions over several hours at
     several meetings. We have heard from students, alumni, staff, faculty and community members. We
     have also received written comment. Most of the comment we received supported the student
     resolutions. Some opposed the resolutions.</p>
    <p>The comments we have heard have made a powerful impression on us. We heard deeply- felt views
     on all sides of the issue, powerful calls to action, and an almost universal concern for social
     justice. We heard judgments based on both personal experience and research. The views we heard
     were expressed with compassion and respect. We are grateful to all those who took the time to
     talk to us. A college can be proud to produce this range of informed and expressive voices on
     an important issue.</p>
    <p>We know that the experience of public comment has been frustrating for some. While most
     communication at Evergreen emphasizes dialogue, the formal public comment sessions at our Board
     meetings consist largely of one-way communication in which members of the public make brief
     statements while the Board members focus on listening. These sessions are valuable in helping
     the Board understand the concerns of the college's constituents, but they do not provide the
     kind of interchange that produces deep understanding or resolves conflicts.</p>
    <p>Toward that end, the President met with the GSU last fall and <a
      href="site://evergreen.edu/news/divestment/divestmentnov3">published a letter</a> to the
     campus community responding to the student resolutions. As co-chairs, <a
      href="site://evergreen.edu/news/divestment/divestmentjan18">we wrote to the Geoduck Student
      Union in response</a> to the GSU resolutions in January. In response to the open letter to the
     Board published in the CPJ on May 19, we want to re-state some of the points made in those
     previous letters.</p>
    <p>The Board long ago delegated to the President, and through the President to the
     administration and faculty, the responsibility and authority for the operation of the college,
     including the college's investment and purchasing policies. A Board that, under pressure from
     either external or internal sources, involves itself in matters that it has previously and
     appropriately delegated to the college&amp;#8217;s operational leadership risks creating chaos
     in the college and, more importantly, may place at risk the principles of shared governance and
     academic freedom. For these reasons, as co-chairs we have declined to put the questions of
     divestment and boycott on the Board's formal agenda. From our perspective, the decision about
     whether to divest or boycott is the President's to make. If we were to launch a formal
     deliberation of these questions at a Board meeting, we would in effect be revoking delegated
     authority, and we are not willing to take that step. The President has previously expressed his
     decision to not take the college down a road of divestment or boycott as described in the
     student resolutions. He explained his reasoning in a <a
      href="site://evergreen.edu/news/divestment/divestmentjan18">message to the campus</a>. At the
     same time, he gave the Vice President for Finance and Administration responsibility for
     reviewing the college's investment policy. That review, which is being undertaken by a
     committee that includes members of the faculty and of the GSU, has produced a proposed revision
     to the college's policy intended to better define and implement the college's commitment to
     socially responsible investment and to ensure that its investment practices are regularly
     reviewed in the future. When this work is complete, we look forward to hearing a report on the
     revised policy.</p>
    <p>Finally, we want to make two points. First, we support the President's decisions and actions
     in response to the student resolutions. Second, the Board&amp;#8217;s position on the issue of
     divestment does not represent a failure to hear, listen or respond. Our position is grounded in
     our understanding of the role of the Board and the institution on these issues. We understand
     that some may not share our view, but this doesn't mean that we haven't listened, understood
     and responded to their views.</p>
    <p>In closing, we want to express our gratitude for the opportunity to serve Evergreen as co-
     chairs of the Board this past year. We take very seriously our responsibility to keep Evergreen
     accessible and affordable to students, to provide equitable compensation and benefits for its
     faculty and staff, and to stay true to the college's historic commitment to providing a quality
     interdisciplinary liberal arts education. This has never been easy to do, and the current
     economic conditions make this work much more difficult. Only the continued dedication and
     creativity of all members of the Evergreen community can overcome these challenges. We are
     honored to be a part of this community.</p>
    <p>Sincerely,<br/> Irene Gonzales, Ed.D. Co-Chair<br/> Anne Proffitt '76 Co-Chair</p>

    <h2>College Responses to Calls for Divestment and Boycott</h2>
    <p>
     <strong>In the Spring of 2010 student resolutions called for divestment from companies
      profiting from the Israel-Palestine conflict and a college boycott of Caterpillar.</strong>
    </p>
    <p>The following documents indicate the College's responses and statements regarding these
     resolutions. In short, the college has not and does not intend to divest from Israel nor
     boycott Caterpillar.</p>

    <content>The holidays offer a much-anticipated break for most students, but over 100 Tacoma area
     high schoolers will have the chance this season to take college level seminars at The Evergreen
     State College Tacoma Program, during Upward Bound program's four day "Winter Summit," December
     22, 23, 29 and 30. <br/>
     <br/> Upward Bound turns 50 this year. The pre-college program for first generation higher
     education hopefuls celebrates 37 years at The Evergreen State College, where dedicated staff
     have helped thousands of Tacoma and Olympia students graduate high school and go on to college. <br/>
     <br/> Students from Clover Park, Mount Tahoma, Foss, and Lincoln will participate this winter
     break in seminar style discussions that challenge them to take ownership of the issues
     affecting their communities. According to TRiO Programs Director Felix Braffith, "the summit's
     goal is to help students get comfortable in college settings, while gaining a sense of
     empowerment that allows them to see they are capable of making positive changes." Each workshop
     will reflect on Dr. Martin Luther King's "I have a Dream" speech and will recognize the
     progress made over the last 50 years as well as the work yet to be done. Faculty from UW, UWT,
     GRCC and Evergreen, along with Upward Bound alumni, will lead the workshops, which are free to
     Upward Bound students. <br/>
     <br/> The summit is likely to attract a core group that will come all four days, said Braffith,
     but he said, "Some will come in and out with the holidays." <br/>

     events every year for area high school students in Tacoma and Olympia. <br/>

     <p>A new organization launched earlier this month to promote the long term success of The
      Evergreen State College, its students and its alumni; <a
       href="site://evergreen.edu/alumni/association">the Associated Alumni and Friends of
       Evergreen</a> is part of <a href="site://_to-delete - Give/give/index">The Evergreen State
       College Foundation</a>, a 501c3 nonprofit organization dedicated to building an outstanding
      future for Evergreen.</p>
     <p>Evergreen has educated more than 40,000 students since it opened in 1971, but the new
      association is not limited to alumni; members will be able to lend their voices to pressing
      issues, advocate on behalf of the college, network with each other, mentor students and recent
      graduates and attend special events. Members make a small donation to join. Members can also
      support Evergreen financially at higher levels, particularly during the year-end giving
      season, as the 2014 tax year draws to a close. The association is open to anyone who cares
      about Evergreen.</p>
     <p>Glen Kriekenbeck, a 1989 Evergreen graduate, is a passionate supporter of the new
      association. As Committee Chair on Alumni and Friends for the Foundation&amp;#8217;s Board of
      Governors, Kriekenbeck acknowledged that, &amp;#8220;advocacy is the first and key part of the
      Association,&amp;#8221; but that, &amp;#8220;networking, mentoring, recruitment and
      philanthropy are all part of the larger vision.&amp;#8221; The previous Evergreen Alumni
      Association operated as part of the college and not as part of a nonprofit.</p>
     <p>In his meetings with alumni in Washington and across the country, Kriekenbeck said he has
      been, &amp;#8220;amazed,&amp;#8221; at the value Evergreen&amp;#8217;s core ideas have brought
      to its graduates&amp;#8217; professional lives. &amp;#8220;A wine maker and a coffee buyer
      both emphasized how important it is to understand the effect of local land use policy on the
      resulting crop and end product,&amp;#8221; he said. Another alumnus, a software developer,
      mentioned his graphic design training at Evergreen helped him visualize structures in code and
      present to end users. He hopes that the new association will encourage such dialogue and
      provide support to students and more recent graduates. But Kriekenbeck noted that,
      &amp;#8220;Evergreen is not just about learning to support your vocation; it&amp;#8217;s about
      learning to be in relationship with each other and society.&amp;#8221;</p>
     <p>To that end, he hopes the new group will be a connector &amp;#8220;between our friends and
      graduates, the college and the wider community.&amp;#8221;</p>

     <p>Last weekend a team of four computer science students from The Evergreen State College
      traveled to New York, where they participated in the annual Cyber Security Awareness Week
      (CSAW) at New York University&amp;#8217;s (NYU) Polytechnic School of Engineering. The team,
      GNU E-Ducks, named for the Evergreen mascot, the geoduck, and the GNU open source software
      movement, became Top-15 finalists in a pool of 300 college teams. The top 15 teams met at NYU
      Thursday, November 13 through Saturday, November 15 and solved numerous cyber security
      puzzles, from reverse engineering to cryptography, in a game of virtual &amp;#8220;Capture the
      Flag.&amp;#8221; The Evergreen team took eighth place in the national competition.</p>
     <p>The students, members of the college&amp;#8217;s cyber security student club, consisted of
      Nick Stephens, Max David, Dylan &amp;#8220;Issak&amp;#8221; Yansane-Sisk, and Nicola Leonardi.
      Their expenses were paid by NYU.</p>
     <p>Richard Weiss, a computer science professor at Evergreen, noted that members of the
      Evergreen Cyber Security Club had also competed in the regional Collegiate Cyber Defense
      Competition last year, where they took second place. &amp;#8220;Evergreen students are being
      recognized as well-prepared in this field,&amp;#8221; said Weiss, &amp;#8220;and many go on to
      graduate school.&amp;#8221;</p>
     <p>In addition to the prestige of making the finals, the students were pleased by the
      networking opportunities available during the weekend, according to Weiss. &amp;#8220;They met
      people from other schools, and there were lots of recruiters there,&amp;#8221; said Weiss.
      Github, Raytheon, Yahoo, Twitter and Google were among the sponsors and had representatives in
      place, as did several government agencies.</p>

     <p>Among the 45 films showing at next week&amp;#8217;s anticipated Olympia Film Festival, a
      dramatic and heartfelt documentary by Evergreen State College alumna Laurel Spellman Smith and
      her co-director, Francine Strickwerda, stands out.<br/>
      <br/>
      <em>Oil &amp; Water</em>, which shows Wednesday, November 12 at 3p.m. at the Capitol Theater
      with both directors in attendance, centers around two boys fighting to save a piece of the
      Amazon rainforest that had been decimated by the oil industry. But this is no typical
      environmental movie. <em>Oil &amp; Water</em> is also an inspiring buddy movie and a coming of
      age story. The film follows two charismatic boys who are so different, they are themselves
      like oil and water. Yet both are compelled to take on a common cause in the face of
      frightening odds. Hugo Lucitante, from the indigenous Cofan tribe in Ecuador wants to save his
      tribe from extinction. David Poritz, from Amherst, Massachusetts is trying to revolutionize
      the oil industry.</p>
     <p>Most people are aware of industrial encroachment into the Amazon rainforest, but few people
      know the extent of the devastation beneath this rich ecosystem in Ecuador. From the early
      1970s to the 1990s, oil companies contaminated vast swaths of pristine jungle by slopping
      billions of gallons of toxic waste into unlined pits. Oil &amp; Water portrays this
      environmental disaster, and the damage oil companies are still wreaking today, from the unique
      perspectives of two young people. (deleted last sentence fragment here)<br/>
      <br/> Hugo, sent at age 10 by his tribe to get an American education, graduated from
      Seattle&amp;#8217;s Bishop Blanchet High School in 2006. David first became aware of the oil
      catastrophe while researching a 6th grade school project and made a commitment to bring
      justice to the Amazon. This award-winning documentary by Spellman Smith and Francine
      Strickwerda follows the two teenagers as their paths intersect in North and Latin America over
      the next six years. The film explores the hazards and pressures the two young men face as they
      carry their cause into adulthood, and also the positive difference they make for their
      communities and the world.<br/>
      <br/> The film also features animated sequences by 2014 Stranger Genius Award Winner and
      Evergreen alum Drew Christie, a frequent contributor to the <em>New York Times</em> Op-Docs.
      &amp;#8220;Using animation allowed us to tell parts of the story we didn&amp;#8217;t have
      footage for,&amp;#8221; said Strickwerda. &amp;#8220;It&amp;#8217;s been fun to see how people
      actually talk about the animation as if it was actual film footage, which is interesting
      because it&amp;#8217;s so distinctively Drew&amp;#8217;s work. We loved collaborating with him.&amp;#8221;<br/>
      <br/> Spellman Smith graduated The Evergreen State College in 1997. This is her second
      partnership with Strickwerda; they previously partnered on a documentary called <em>Busting
       Out</em>, which examined Americans&amp;#8217; attitudes toward breasts, from awkward early
      puberty to fatal breast cancer. Spellman Smith has directed two other documentaries, <em>The
       Corporal&amp;#8217;s Diary</em> and <em>Faith and Fear: The Children of Krishna.<br/>
      </em><br/> Strickwerda and Spellman Smith have numerous stories of their time in the Amazon
      over the eight years they worked with the Cofan Tribe. They tell of giant bugs, of slipping
      and sliding in mud, and of annoying their Cofan hosts, without whom they &amp;#8220;would have
      been toast,&amp;#8221; said Strickwerda.<br/>
      <br/> Though they admitted they often looked like buffoons while trying to film in the Amazon,
      they persevered, and it paid off. &amp;#8220;Looking back, we had no idea that Hugo and David
      would become such fascinating young men. We didn&amp;#8217;t realize just how close the oil
      companies were to making another assault on Cofan land. And we certainly didn&amp;#8217;t
      imagine that we&amp;#8217;d be telling the story of a startling effort to revolutionize the
      oil industry,&amp;#8221; said Spellman Smith.</p>
     <p>Said Strickwerda, &amp;#8220;We are hopeful that the Cofan will be able to save their
      culture and their land."</p>

     <p>This Sunday, November 9, The Evergreen State College will start celebrating
      Veterans&amp;#8217; Day early. The college will be one of more than 100 USA Track and Field
      events called Run with a Soldier, happening nationally this weekend.</p>
     <p>The 5K run/walk and one mile family walk to honor servicemen and women and veterans will
      raise money for the new Evergreen Veterans&amp;#8217; Center and for the college&amp;#8217;s
      own track and field program.</p>
     <p>Run with a Soldier is a first-of-its-kind USATF initiative, motivating runners across
      America to connect in person and on social media with men and women who have served in the
      U.S. Armed Forces. Avid runners are encouraged to identify soldiers in their communities and
      run alongside the service men and women in local races.<br/>
      <br/> Run with a Soldier is a product of U.S. Paralympic Team Head Coach Bryan
      Hoddle&amp;#8217;s vision to help rehabilitate wounded warriors, based on his time as a
      volunteer at the Walter Reed Army Medical Center and with the Lakeshore Foundation.</p>
     <p>&amp;#8220;When soldiers come home, it&amp;#8217;s not over for them,&amp;#8221; said
      Hoddle, referring to physical injuries and PTSD. But, he noted, many veterans tell him that
      exercise, and running in particular, makes them feel better.</p>
     <p>The Evergreen State College, an acknowledged military-friendly school with a growing veteran
      population and a respected track and field program, was a natural partner for Hoddle, who
      lives in Olympia. &amp;#8220;Evergreen has a phenomenally supportive veterans&amp;#8217;
      group,&amp;#8221; said Hoddle, regarding the year-old campus Veterans&amp;#8217; Resource
      Center.</p>
     <p>According to Evergreen&amp;#8217;s Vet Corps Navigator, Elizabeth West, who works in the
      Veterans Resource Center (VRC), funds raised from the run will help pay for
      veterans&amp;#8217; events on campus, including the annual coining ceremony. The VRC will be
      on hand at the event with information tables and will be setting up a flag display on campus
      later that afternoon. &amp;#160;&amp;#160;</p>
     <p>Hoddle, who was recently honored by the State of Washington&amp;#8217;s House of
      Representatives for working with disabled soldiers and athletes with disabilities, expects up
      to 100 participants this weekend and hopes Run with a Soldier will become an annual
      Veterans&amp;#8217; Day weekend event.</p>
     <p>&amp;#8220;Running is healthy for the body and mind,&amp;#8221; said Hoddle. &amp;#8220;I
      realized that we could make Veterans Day so much more impactful by joining forces&amp;#8230;
      to hopefully start a national running tradition. This is only the first year; if we help even
      one soldier, that will be awesome.&amp;#8221;</p>

     <p>If utility managers, transportation planners, scientists and politicians can agree on one
      thing, it is that American infrastructure is aging.</p>
     <p>The Pacific Northwest faces a growing public infrastructure crisis of deteriorating
      facilities, escalating maintenance costs and shrinking resources for investment.</p>
     <p>The region could, however, become a national innovation leader by developing sustainable,
      resilient, and affordable, infrastructure systems, according to findings of a new report from
      the Center for Sustainable Infrastructure (CSI) at The Evergreen State College.&amp;#160;</p>
     <p>&amp;#8220;We are going to spend many billions of dollars on our infrastructure just to keep
      our society and economy functioning.&amp;#160; This is the reality.&amp;#160; The question is:
      how do we get smart about how we&amp;#8217;ll invest that money?&amp;#8221; said CSI Director,
      Rhys Roth.</p>
     <p>Increasingly, infrastructure professionals recognize that innovation is needed, according to
      the report, <em>Infrastructure Crisis, Sustainable Solutions: Rethinking Our Infrastructure
       Investment Strategies</em>.&amp;#160;</p>
     <p>CSI interviewed 70 Pacific Northwest infrastructure innovators and thought leaders with
      expertise in energy, transportation, water, waste, and infrastructure finance. &amp;#160;The
      report distills their insights to provide guidance to the region&amp;#8217;s current and
      future infrastructure leaders, policymakers, and change agents.&amp;#160;</p>
     <p>A key conclusion: infrastructure spending decisions need to be rethought at the earliest
      stages. &amp;#8221;Smarter investment decisions will help us develop systems that most benefit
      communities for the long-term,&amp;#8221; said Roth. The report defines smart investments as
      affordable, resilient, environmentally sound and integrated. &amp;#8220;They&amp;#8217;re also
      rich in community co-benefits, including for the local economy,&amp;#8221; said Roth.</p>
     <p>Christie True, Director of King County (Wash.) Department of Natural Resources and Parks,
      agrees:&amp;#160; &amp;#8220;Whether it&amp;#8217;s a wastewater treatment plant, a solid
      waste transfer station or a regional trail network connected to transportation centers,
      building sustainable infrastructure isn&amp;#8217;t a luxury &amp;#8211; it&amp;#8217;s a
      necessity. It&amp;#8217;s the foundation upon which we can build communities that are better
      for people, better for the planet and better for our bottom line.&amp;#8221;</p>
     <p>The report also finds that the workforce in every infrastructure sector is
      graying.&amp;#160; &amp;#8220;We&amp;#8217;re about to lose an enormous resource of real-world
      operational knowledge to the coming retirement wave,&amp;#8221; says Roth.&amp;#160;
      &amp;#8220;We urgently need to inspire and equip a new generation of infrastructure innovators
      to enter these professions.&amp;#8221; Roth sees a wide range of professions with a role to
      play, from leaders of infrastructure agencies and utilities, to community planners, elected
      officials, builders and design teams, engineers, technology firms, financiers, advocates and
      regulators.</p>
     <p>Responsive to the market, the report asks how we will power our homes and businesses, access
      clean water, get where we need to go, and keep waste from harming us in the decades ahead. CSI
      encourages inter-agency collaboration, use of smart technologies, new ways to harness private
      sector expertise, and new planning tools to achieve better economic and community results.</p>
     <p>The report recommends making tough financial reforms, for instance, accounting upfront for
      life-cycle costs of a project and reforming lowest-bid procurement practices. Finally, the
      report examines the positive ripple effect of a paradigm shift on physical and mental health,
      quality of life, and competitiveness in the global economy.</p>
     <p>Mike McCarty, CEO of Association of Washington Cities praised the report as timely and
      relevant. &amp;#8220;Cities are on the forefront of managing critical infrastructure systems
      and they face the significant challenges of aging systems, a growing population, and
      significant fiscal constraints. New ways of meeting our infrastructure needs will be needed.
      Forward thinking like that captured in <em>Infrastructure Crisis, Sustainable Solutions</em>
      is essential to inventing the future of infrastructure.&amp;#8221;</p>
     <p>&amp;#8221;The report&amp;#8217;s ultimate measure of success will involve an evolution
      toward healthy, prosperous, beautiful, and cohesive communities,&amp;#8221; said
      Roth.&amp;#160; &amp;#8220;Our hope is it will prove useful to public, nonprofit, academic,
      and industry leaders as they help Northwest communities transform how they think about, plan
      for, and invest in their infrastructure assets.&amp;#8221;</p>

    <content><p>The fiber arts are woven through the lives of most Indigenous tribes, including
      those of the South Puget Sound. They are used as tribal identifiers, in clothing, ceremony and
      home d&amp;#233;cor, as well as basketry to store items for every need.</p>
     <p>The weekend of October 3-5 nearly 700 visitors converged on the Squaxin Island Tribal Center
      for a regional basket weaving conference, organized by the Northwest Native American
      Basketweavers Association.&amp;#160; The conference had partial support from a
      recently-announced $100,000 Our Town grant from the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) for
      a partnership between the Squaxin Island Tribe and The Evergreen State College&amp;#8217;s
      Longhouse Education and Cultural Center.&amp;#160; The Our Town grant will be the second such
      grant that partnership has received.</p>
     <p>Our Town is the NEA&amp;#8217;s two-year old leadership initiative focused on creative
      placemaking projects. In creative placemaking, partners from both public and private sectors
      come together to strategically shape the physical and social character of a neighborhood,
      town, city, or region around arts and cultural activities.</p>
     <p>Last year, recognizing the significance of water to the culture of the Puget Sound, NEA
      awarded the partnership $100,000 for the 2012 Canoe Journey, in which the 400-person Squaxin
      tribe, with assistance from Evergreen, hosted a gathering of thousands of Native Americans who
      arrived in over 100 canoes, along with non-Native participants who wanted to learn about the
      tribes.</p>
     <p>&amp;#8220;The Squaxin Island Tribe expressed their cultural identity in so many beautiful
      ways as hosts of the 2012 Tribal Canoe Journey&amp;#8212;in the regalia they made, the art
      that was gifted to thousands of participants, and the many community members of all ages that
      filled the ceremonial protocol stage. People are still talking about how well they represented
      themselves as hosts of the 2012 Tribal Canoe Journey,&amp;#8221; noted Evergreen Longhouse
      Director Tina Kuckkahn-Miller.</p>
     <p>National Endowment for the Arts Chairman Landesman said, &amp;#8220;Communities across our
      country are using smart design and leveraging the arts to enhance quality of life and promote
      their distinctive identities.&amp;#160;</p>
     <p>In addition to the NEA grant, The Evergreen Longhouse has received capital construction
      grants from the Ford Foundation, and will receive a Governor&amp;#8217;s Arts and Heritage
      Award as a Heritage Organization this fall.&amp;#160; Longhouse architect Johnpaul Jones
      (Choctaw), will receive a Heritage Artist award from the Governor, and Evergreen student Earl
      Davis (Shoalwater Bay Tribe) will receive a Young Arts Leader Award at the
      Governor&amp;#8217;s Arts and Heritage Awards ceremony in Seattle on October 28.</p>
     <p><strong>#</strong></p>
     <strong>The National Endowment for the Arts</strong> was established by Congress in 1965 as an
     independent agency of the federal government. To date, the NEA has awarded more than $4 billion
     to support artistic excellence, creativity, and innovation for the benefit of individuals and
     communities. The NEA extends its work through partnerships with state arts agencies, local
     leaders, other federal agencies, and the philanthropic
     sector.<strong>&amp;#160;</strong></content>

      <strong>Wild Parrots of Telegraph Hill Author to Speak October 30<br/>
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>&amp;#8220;You go to nature for an experience of the sacred...to re-establish your contact
      with the core of things,&amp;#8230;&amp;#160; to enable you to come back to the world of
      people and operate more effectively.&amp;#8221;</p>
     <p>
      <em>-Willi Unsoeld</em>
     </p>
     <p>Renowned for his book, <em>The Wild Parrots of Telegraph Hill: A Love Story</em>, Mark
      Bittner is the first speaker in the Willi Unsoeld Seminar Series at The Evergreen State
      College, on October 30. The event, which takes place at 7pm in the campus Longhouse, follows
      the college&amp;#8217;s 2014-15 academic theme of &amp;#8220;Paying Attention.&amp;#8221;
      Bittner will discuss a period when, as a street person in San Francisco, he developed an
      affinity with a (still-vital) flock of wild parrots inhabiting Telegraph Hill. The book went
      on to become a documentary film and Bittner has gone on to write his forthcoming book Street
      Song, a memoir.</p>
     <p>Willi Unsoeld is a household name among mountaineers, famed for his first ascent of Mt.
      Everest&amp;#8217;s West Ridge in 1963, but Unsoeld had a deep intellectual life beyond the
      sport of climbing. As a philosopher and founding faculty member at The Evergreen State
      College, Unsoeld embodied the interdisciplinary spirit of the college. After his death in
      1979, the Unsoeld family, friends and colleagues created a legacy in his name for an annual
      seminar series to take place at Evergreen. Past speakers have included Jim Hightower, Yevgeny
      Yevtushenko, Terry Tempest Williams, Tom Hornbein and The International Council of Thirteen
      Indigenous Grandmothers.</p>
     <p>Bittner grew up in Vancouver, Washington and graduated high school in 1969. Thus, he was
      intrigued by the invitation to be a Willi Unsoeld Seminar Series speaker at Evergreen.
      &amp;#8220;My high school crowd (in the late &amp;#8216;60s) was making a lot of noise about
      (Evergreen) as a place to go (to college),&amp;#8221; he noted.&amp;#160;&amp;#160;</p>
     <p>In San Francisco, where he moved to play music after high school, Bittner says he slept in
      &amp;#8220;odd places,&amp;#8221; including the roof of a hotel and a store room. While caring
      for the property of a Telegraph Hill homeowner, he first spied the parrots. &amp;#8220;I knew
      nothing about them,&amp;#8221; he said, &amp;#8220;but I watched them very closely and noticed
      there were a lot of social interactions going on between the birds. The idea of paying
      attention was central to what I was doing with them.&amp;#8221;</p>
     <p>Interactions with birding and environmental groups have since made Bittner aware of the
      issues facing urban avian life. &amp;#8220;I am sensitive to the controversy on native versus
      non-native species, for example,&amp;#8221; he said.</p>
     <p>According to Evergreen Vice President and Provost Michael Zimmerman, &amp;#8220;the purpose
      of these lectures is to help us see things in new ways and across differences. Willi used to
      say the most important thing is how we treat each other&amp;#8230; and by extension the way we
      treat our surroundings,&amp;#8221; said Zimmerman. &amp;#8220;Mark Bittner was seeing things
      in a way that others were missing. His message of discovery is important to us.&amp;#8221;</p>
     <p>The second speaker in the series will be Oscar winning documentary filmmaker Audrey Marrs,
      on January 29. Famed for her 2011 Oscar winner, &amp;#8220;Inside Job,&amp;#8221; Marrs
      graduated Evergreen in 1996. A collaboration with director Charles Ferguson, Inside Job was a
      2010 Official Selection at the Cannes, New York, Telluride and Toronto International Film
      Festivals. Wesley Morris of <em>The Boston Globe</em> called it, "scarier than anything Wes
      Craven and John Carpenter have ever made&amp;#8230;"</p>
     <p>#</p>
     <p>Media outlets can schedule phone interviews with Mark Bittner between now and October 27 and
      in-person interviews in Seattle October 27-28 or in Olympia October 29-30. To schedule an
      interview or attendance at the event, please contact Meryl Lipman 360-867-5213 <a

    <content><em>Washington Monthly</em> magazine has ranked The Evergreen State College #14 among
     nearly 700 master&amp;#8217;s universities in the country. Posing a question unique among
     publications that produce college rankings, <em>Washington Monthly</em> asks, &amp;#8220;What
     are colleges doing for the country?&amp;#8221;&amp;#160; The answer for Evergreen is quite a
     lot. <p>In its explanation of its latest rankings, <em>Washington Monthly</em> noted,
      &amp;#8220;We all benefit when colleges produce groundbreaking research that drives economic
      growth, when they put students from lower-income families on the path to a better life, and
      when they shape the character of future leaders.&amp;#8221;&amp;#160; With that in mind,
       <em>Washington Monthly</em> ranks schools based on their contribution to the public good in
      three broad categories: <strong>Social Mobility</strong> (recruiting and graduating low-income
      students), <strong>Research</strong> (producing cutting-edge scholarship and PhDs), and
       <strong>Service</strong> (encouraging students to give something back to their country).</p>
     <p>Evergreen received several prestigious accolades this year: the college ranked #4 among
      public regional universities in the West in <em>US News &amp; World Report.</em> The
      magazine&amp;#8217;s definition of the West reaches to Texas. <em>US News</em> ranked
      Evergreen #1 in the same category for best undergraduate teaching as well as #11 best for
      veterans. Evergreen was also listed in the publication as top 15 nationally for best
      first-year student experiences and top 12 best for "learning communities - engaging students
      in learning, including outside the classroom.&amp;#8221;</p>
     <p><em>The Fiske Guide to Colleges</em> praised Evergreen, notably, as the only public
      institution on the West Coast to be a "Best Buy" college. Evergreen has made that list every
      year since 2010. <em>The</em>
      <em>Princeton Review</em> ranked Evergreen as one of the Best 379 Colleges in America and
      Militaryfriendly.com lauds Evergreen as a friendly college for veterans and active duty
      military personnel.</p>
     <p>&amp;#8220;Because no single ranking can paint the entire picture of an
      institution,&amp;#8221; explained Evergreen spokesperson Todd Sprague,
      &amp;#8220;it&amp;#8217;s helpful to have a variety of measures to assess the value delivered
      to students and society.&amp;#160; <em>Washington Monthly&amp;#8217;s</em> focus on social
      mobility, research and service provides a lens that&amp;#8217;s different from most other
      rankings and a perspective that&amp;#8217;s especially valuable for a public institution like
      Evergreen.&amp;#8221;</p>

     <p>South Puget Sound Community College, The Evergreen State College and Saint
      Martin&amp;#8217;s University are hosting three South Sound College Planning Seminars in
      October for local high school students, their families and counselors.</p>
     <p>The workshops will highlight the differences between the three different types of
      institutions: SPSCC, a public, two-year, community college, Evergreen, a public, four-year
      college, and Saint Martin&amp;#8217;s, a private, four-year university. Topics to be covered
      are finding the right college &amp;#8220;fit,&amp;#8221; financial aid and the college
      application. All three sessions are free and open to the public. No reservation is
      required.</p>
     <p>This marks the second year of the collaboration, an idea originally proposed by Clarisse
      Leong, associate director of admissions at Evergreen.</p>
     <p>&amp;#8220;I was thinking about ways in which our three institutions could work together and
      promote higher education,&amp;#8221; Leong says. &amp;#8220;Since there isn&amp;#8217;t much
      overlap between us and we represent three different types of college options, I contacted the
      two institutions to propose a joint event geared towards students in Thurston
      County.&amp;#8221;</p>
     <p>All three institutions will have representatives present at each workshop to speak with
      students, says Sarah Weiss, director of admissions for Saint Martin&amp;#8217;s. But the focus
      will also include providing general information about planning for college.</p>
     <p>&amp;#8220;We want to provide the South Sound region with a comprehensive knowledge base
      about the overall college planning process, while at the same time highlighting the diverse
      academic options high school students and their families have right here in their own
      backyard,&amp;#8221; Weiss says.</p>
     <p>The sessions will be held as follows:<br/> &amp;#8226; How to choose a college
      that&amp;#8217;s good for you: Learn about the differences between all three types of
      institutions, degrees offered and how to choose a school based on &amp;#8220;fit&amp;#8221;.
      This seminar will be held Wednesday, October 8, 6 p.m. &amp;#8211; 8 p.m., in Lecture Hall 1,
      at The Evergreen State College, 2700 Evergreen Parkway, NW, Olympia. For more information,
      contact Clarisse Leong at 360-867-6170.<br/> &amp;#8226; College essays and applications 101:
      Find out how to apply for admission, the differences in admission requirements and tips on
      writing your college application essay. This seminar will be held Wednesday, October 15, in
      Building 26-101, at South Puget Sound Community College, 2011 Mottman Road SW, Olympia, WA
      98512-6292. For more information, contact Christina Winstead at 360-596-5446.<br/> &amp;#8226;
      Financing college: Discover the different kinds of aid available at all three types of
      institutions, including scholarships, financial need and federal aid, merit aid, deadlines and
      processes. This session will be held Wednesday, October 22, in Cebula Hall, third floor, at
      Saint Martin&amp;#8217;s University, 5000 Abbey Way SE, Lacey. For more information, contact
      Kacie McPartland at 360-486-8121.</p>

     <p>More than two dozen Sovereign Indian Nations within Washington State will meet with the
      state government on June 18 at The Evergreen State College for the 25th Annual Centennial
      Accord. The event is usually held on tribal lands, but in a rare exception, Evergreen received
      the honor of hosting this year.&amp;#160;&amp;#160;</p>
     <p>The Centennial Accord is a government-to-government meeting between 25 state agencies and
      tribal governments &amp;#8220;to develop procedures by which a government-to-government policy
      will be implemented,&amp;#8221; according to the Governor&amp;#8217;s Office of Indian
      Affairs.</p>
     <p>&amp;#160;&amp;#8220;The Centennial Accord, as the name implies, is an outgrowth of the
      state centennial in 1989,&amp;#8221; said David Nicandri, Washington historian and director of
      the Washington State Historical Society during the Centennial.&amp;#160; &amp;#8220;Arguably
      the Accord and the annual tribal canoe journey (the original to Seattle) are the most enduring
      legacies of that celebration.&amp;#8221;</p>
     <p>&amp;#8220;Part of the genesis of the Centennial Accord was the frustration of the State not
      recognizing the unique role and relationship of the Tribes in Washington State&amp;#8217;s
      history, but that was only part of it,&amp;#8221; said Ron Allen, Jamestown
      S&amp;#8217;Klallam chairman and one of the founders of the original Accord agreement.
      &amp;#8220;Over the course of the State&amp;#8217;s history, Tribes had experienced a
      deteriorating tense relationship and ongoing debate over who was more sovereign.&amp;#160; The
      Tribes and State were not coming to the table as equals.&amp;#8221;</p>
     <p>&amp;#160;Allen, along with leaders of other tribes, asked Governor Booth Gardner to
      celebrate the centennial by initiating the Accords to set aside differences between the state
      and the tribes and settle problems on a mutually-respectful government-to-government
      basis.</p>
     <p>&amp;#160;&amp;#8220;After 25 years of the most progressive government-to-government
      commitment between the State of Washington and the 29 Sovereign Indian Nations, we have made a
      difference,&amp;#8221; said Allen, noting the profound impact of the Accord. &amp;#8220;We
      have not accomplished all our goals, but this commitment has resulted in a solid progressive
      foundation to advance improvements in most areas of Tribal concerns, including natural
      resource management, education, health care, economic development and social/community
      affairs.&amp;#8221;</p>
     <p>&amp;#160;&amp;#8220;A quarter century ago, the Centennial Accord was adopted to foster
      important relationships between our Native American communities and state
      government,&amp;#8221; said state Senator John McCoy, who will also be participating in the
      Accord event. &amp;#8220;The goals of mutual understanding and collaboration are just as
      important today as they were 25 years ago. We all know we have to work closely together to
      solve the complex challenges facing our communities today.&amp;#8221;</p>
     <p>&amp;#160;&amp;#8220;This is an outstanding opportunity for the state and the
      college,&amp;#8221; said Evergreen spokesperson Todd Sprague.&amp;#160; &amp;#8220;We are
      honored and excited to have this event on campus. Hosting the Accord builds on the
      relationships and commitment we have and will continue to have to serve and work in
      partnership with Native American communities and governments in Washington and across the
      country.&amp;#8221;</p>

     <p>Blending classic Chinese musical theatre and Broadway, The Evergreen State College presents
      The Blooming Season, an original, student-written production, to be performed on Friday May
      30th, and Saturday May 31st at 7:30 p.m. in Evergreen&amp;#8217;s Communications Building
      Experimental Theater, at 2700 Evergreen Parkway NW in Olympia. Tickets are $5 at the door.
      Parking is $2 on Friday and free on Saturday. For more information, call 360-867-7444 or visit
      evergreen.edu/performingarts.</p>
     <p>The Blooming Season was born out of an interdisciplinary program that blends China studies
      and performing arts called &amp;#8220;Theatre of Fantasy: Performing Chinese Drama on the
      Western Stage.&amp;#8221; It has been taught by Evergreen faculty members Rose Jang and Zhang
      Er, who helped direct and produce the show. Nick McCord, one of Jang and Li&amp;#8217;s
      students, wrote the script and lyrics during winter quarter as his senior project, and will be
      playing one of the lead roles.</p>
     <p>Greg Youtz, music and China studies professor at Pacific Lutheran University, and son of
      Evergreen founding faculty member Byron Youtz, has also played a critical role in the
      production. Youtz has composed original music for the show, and provided traditional Chinese
      instruments and instruction on playing them. The music mixes the conventions of Chinese music
      and Broadway. The student musicians have come up with original arrangements for
      Youtz&amp;#8217;s compositions.</p>
     <p>&amp;#8220;A production like this is unprecedented at Evergreen,&amp;#8221; said Rose Jang.
      &amp;#8220;It&amp;#8217;s a big medley of Western and Chinese traditions&amp;#8212;movement,
      music, poetry, stage fighting, literary themes. The plot references three famous stories from
      Chinese theatre, but presents it in a Broadway style, and still feels fresh and familiar.
      It&amp;#8217;s a very original and organic production, and the students are really the seminal
      creators for the whole project.&amp;#8221;</p>
     <p>&amp;#8220;What amazes me is that twelve weeks ago all we had was Nick&amp;#8217;s original
      script,&amp;#8221; said Greg Youtz, PLU professor and composer for The Blooming Season.
      &amp;#8220;Now we have a full-fledged musical production with student-originated arrangements
      and choreography. The 42 students in this program have dedicated so much time and energy to
      this project, and I&amp;#8217;ve seen them grow so much. It&amp;#8217;s really an incredible
      piece of theatre and a testament to a lot of hard work and vision.&amp;#8221;</p>
     <p>The Blooming Season focuses on a young woman&amp;#8212;in the afterlife&amp;#8212;who is on
      trial and is repeatedly convicted to hell. The crime she supposedly committed was loving too
      much and fighting against tradition. The play follows her as she is reincarnated and lives
      former lives she&amp;#8217;s had, repeating her crime of love. Each of her three
      reincarnations mirrors the plots of classic, traditional Chinese drama. The play is a drama, a
      comedy, and a musical with Western and Chinese influences.</p>

     <p>&amp;#8220;The Readers Project: Honoring the Fallen&amp;#8221; will take place in the
      college&amp;#8217;s library lobby, from noon to 1 p.m.&amp;#160; The college will be closed
      Monday, May 26 in observance of Memorial Day.</p>
     <p>The ceremony has taken place at the college for the past three years.&amp;#160; In 2011,
      members of the community were selected to recite the names of all 6,058 U.S. service members
      who had at that point been identified by the Department of Defense as fatalities in the
      various campaigns of the global war on terror.&amp;#160;&amp;#160; In 2012, selected community
      readers recited the names of 422 U.S. service members who had been identified as fatalities
      within the prior twelve months.&amp;#160; This year we will add the 118 names of those who
      have given their lives in service to their country over the past year since our last reading
      in May 2013.</p>
     <p>&amp;#8220;The Evergreen State College is proud to provide this opportunity for the
      community to recognize the fallen service members and contemplate the profound sacrifices that
      military families and communities throughout the nation are continuing to make,&amp;#8221;
      said Randy Kelley, director of Evergreen&amp;#8217;s Veterans Center.&amp;#160;</p>
     <p>The observance is being organized by The Veterans of Evergreen Transition and Success Team
      (VETS), an advisory group comprised of Evergreen staff, faculty and students and the Evergreen
      Veterans Resource Center.&amp;#160; For more information on the event, call the Evergreen

    <content><p>Could the Science Carnival be the best day of your life?</p>
     <p>&amp;#160;That&amp;#8217;s what a local seven-year-old said about the Science Carnival last
      year, according to Evergreen faculty and Science Carnival organizer Dharshi Bopegedera.</p>
     <p>&amp;#8220;She was so excited about the experiments that she came both days,&amp;#8221;
      recalled Bopegedera.&amp;#160;</p>
     <p>Now in its 11<sup>th</sup> year, the Science Carnival and Research Expo at The Evergreen
      State College offers more than 200 presentations by Evergreen science students designed to be
      participatory, hands-on, accessible, and fun. The carnival is an opportunity for Evergreen
      students to present their work to an audience with diverse ages and backgrounds.</p>
     <p>&amp;#8220;This is an opportunity for our students to explain science to a broad spectrum of
      people and to learn by teaching&amp;#8212;which is a rewarding challenge. We also enjoy
      serving the community that supports this college,&amp;#8221; said Bopegedera, who teaches
      chemistry at Evergreen.&amp;#160; She emphasized the value of the carnival for children and
      the schools they attend.</p>
     <p>&amp;#8220;Many local teachers use this as an extra credit opportunity for their students
      and many children use ideas they saw at the carnival to inspire their own science
      projects,&amp;#8221; said Bopegedera. &amp;#8220;Children see what our students are doing and
      think &amp;#8216;I, too, can do that&amp;#8217;.&amp;#8221;</p> This year&amp;#8217;s topics
     and presentations will include how cola can dissolve certain foods; how oxygen affects the
     appetite of crabs; how sea slugs convert light and a shellfish touch tank.&amp;#160; This
     event, which runs May 30 to 31, is free and open to the public on Evergreen&amp;#8217;s Olympia
     campus, 2700 Evergreen Parkway in Olympia from 10 a.m. &amp;#8211; 3 p.m. To park free, request

    <content><p>Five Evergreen alumni have been awarded some of the nation&amp;#8217;s highest
      scholarship honors in the sciences and humanities for the 2014-2015 academic year. Two have
      been awarded Fulbright Awards for research overseas, while three will receive National Science
      Foundation graduate fellowships each totaling $150,000 toward their doctorate degrees.</p>
     <p>Nisa Karimi &amp;#8216;09, Christina Masden &amp;#8216;11 and Kari Gathier &amp;#8217;00 are
      among the 2000 graduate students awarded the NSF fellowship this year.&amp;#160; The National
      Science Foundation is an independent federal agency created by Congress in 1950 to advance the
      progress of science and is a major funding source for research in American colleges and
      universities. Nine National Science Foundation Fellowships have been awarded to Evergreen
      alumni since 2010.</p>
     <p>&amp;#8220;It means so much that the NSF recognizes my potential, and I'm unbelievably proud
      to be a fellow,&amp;#8221; said Christina Masden, who is pursuing a doctorate focusing on the
      interaction between humans and computers at the Georgia Institute of Technology. She graduated
      Evergreen with a bachelor&amp;#8217;s of arts and a bachelor&amp;#8217;s of science, focusing
      on both science and humanities.</p>
     <p>&amp;#8220;My chosen field is highly interdisciplinary, and my undergraduate studies at
      Evergreen were essential for preparing me for the work that I'm doing now,&amp;#8221; Masden
      said.&amp;#160; &amp;#8220;However, the most important things I learned at Evergreen went
      beyond academics. I refer to the life lessons I learned as frequently as I refer to my notes
      and textbooks.&amp;#8221;</p>
     <p>Kaye Michalak &amp;#8217;13 has been awarded a Fulbright English language teaching
      assistantship in Turkey. Samuel Kaviar, who graduated in 2012, has been awarded a Fulbright
      full research grant to study sloth habitat in Panama.</p>
     <p>&amp;#8220;I have a ton of gratitude to the Evergreen professors and the students
      who&amp;#8217;ve supported me, and without whom I wouldn&amp;#8217;t be doing this work,
      &amp;#8220;said Kaviar.&amp;#160; &amp;#8220;I hope the Fulbright will allow me to spread
      access to the scientific method to underserved communities to study interesting species around
      the world.&amp;#8221;</p>
     <p>Kaviar will be continuing and deepening his undergraduate research on the three-toed pygmy
      sloth, which are only endemic to the 1.7 square mile island of Escudo de Veraguas, off the
      Caribbean coast of Panama.&amp;#160; &amp;#160;He and two other Evergreen students will
      continue their outreach and partnership with the local indigenous
      Ng&amp;#246;be-Bugl&amp;#233; communities to whom the island of Escudo belongs.</p>
     <p>Michalak will be an English teaching assistant, while working on a project she started
      studying abroad in Morocco as an undergrad at Evergreen. She will be looking at what
      &amp;#8216;modernity&amp;#8217; and &amp;#8216;liberation&amp;#8217; mean and look like in
      Turkey, specifically through the eyes of women.</p>
     <p>&amp;#8220;It honestly was a bit of a shock to receive the scholarship,&amp;#8221; she
      said.&amp;#160; &amp;#8220;It still doesn't feel like anything has happened and probably won't
      until I actually go to Turkey,&amp;#8221; said Michalak. &amp;#8220;I&amp;#8217;m excited to
      continue researching what interests me and go into this adventure with an open
      mind.&amp;#8221;</p>
     <p>&amp;#8220;I am immensely proud of the hard work that these two students put into their
      Fulbright proposals, and know that they will represent Evergreen well by virtue of the depth
      of character and commitment they will bring to their overseas work,&amp;#8221; said Michael
      Clifthorne, coordinator for international programs and academic advisor at Evergreen.</p>
     Since 2000, eight Fulbrights have been awarded to Evergreen students, most recently in 2011.
     The Fulbright Program is a program of highly competitive grants for international educational
     exchange in the fields of art, academia, business, journalism, and education. The program is
     named after U.S. Senator J. William Fulbright, who founded the program after the Second World
     War.</content>

     <p>An AmeriCorps grant has just been awarded to help The Evergreen State College recruit,
      train, and coordinate college students to serve as college access coaches in
      Evergreen&amp;#8217;s Gateways for Incarcerated Youth program. The students will coach

      to help Green Hill students become more academically engaged, graduate from high school, and
      go on to post-secondary education.</p>
     <p>&amp;#8220;College access coaching is an effective strategy to help bridge the educational
      opportunity gap,&amp;#8221; said Ellen Shortt-Sanchez, director of Evergreen&amp;#8217;s
      Center for Community-Based Learning and Action, which houses the Gateways program.
      &amp;#8220;Access to post-secondary education is a critical issue in our state and nation. The
      CAC AmeriCorps program will mobilize Evergreen students at Gateways for Incarcerated Youth and
      build partnerships to help youth at Green Hill to achieve their educational goals.&amp;#8221;
      &amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;</p>
     <p>College Access Corps activities will match incarcerated youth with Evergreen
      students.&amp;#160; This grant will help Evergreen students build on Gateways&amp;#8217;
      Robert Wood Johnson Foundation&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8220;Forward Promise&amp;#8221; grant of
      $500,000 awarded June 2013.&amp;#160; The goal of &amp;#8220;Forward Promise&amp;#8221; is to
      raise awareness of the educational needs of incarcerated youth and reduce disparities that
      make it more challenging for young men of color to access and complete higher education.</p>
     <p>Evergreen has been selected to manage the College Access Corps program with funding from
      Washington Campus Compact (WACC), a coalition of Washington State higher education
      institutions, which is funded by AmeriCorps.</p>

     <p>Robotics, languages, hard science and humanities are some of the 125 courses offering one to
      16 college credits on offer in two summer sessions at The Evergreen State College this
      year.&amp;#160; With enrollment opening May 19, these courses are open to the public as well
      as students, and offer a full range of academic options. &amp;#160; &amp;#160;</p>
     <p>&amp;#8220;Summer quarter is a great opportunity to make some progress toward a degree or
      just follow up on something that interests you,&amp;#8221; said Sarah Ryan, dean of evening
      and weekend studies at Evergreen.&amp;#160; &amp;#8220;There&amp;#8217;s a lot of flexibility
      in the length of classes, as well as chances to attend on weekdays, evenings and
      weekends.&amp;#8221;&amp;#160;</p>
     <p>One of the quarter&amp;#8217;s course stand-outs will be a new class on printing and
      robotics, where students will learn how to use Android devices to control physical devices
      through wireless communication, and 3D printers to produce real objects.</p>
     <p>Evergreen&amp;#8217;s new 3D printers, nicknamed Karl and Hermann, are a recent gift from
      Evergreen alum Bre Pettis, CEO of MakerBot, which designs, builds and sells compact 3D
      printers to manufacturers, artists, schools and entrepreneurs.&amp;#160;</p>
     <p>A business law course, taught on weekends in June and July, will review intellectual
      property in business, the employer-employee relationship, contracts, and how to apply current
      law to popular conflicts.</p>
     <p>In the natural realm, &amp;#8220;Summer Ornithology: Birds in the Hand,&amp;#8221; is a
      course that has been taught more than 30 years at Evergreen, adding more than 24,000 banded
      birds to ornithology&amp;#8217;s data base.&amp;#160; Taught entirely in the field in Oregon,
      students net, band and release several hundred birds of about 25 species, while working on
      field identification and behavioral observations.</p>
     <p>Summer quarter classes are offered at Evergreen&amp;#8217;s Olympia and Tacoma
      campuses.&amp;#160; Faculty and advisers will be on hand Wednesday, May 14 from 4 to 6 p.m. in
      the Constantino Recreation Center at the Olympia campus.&amp;#160; Registration opens May 19,
      and the full summer session runs June 23 to September 7.&amp;#160; For all course offerings

     <p>Evergreen&amp;#8217;s Longhouse Education and Cultural Center received a $500,000 grant from
      the Ford Foundation to build the next stage of a planned &amp;#8220;indigenous arts
      campus,&amp;#8221; The Evergreen State College announced today.&amp;#160;</p>
     <p>The grant will fund the design and construction of a fiber arts studio, with the goal of
      preserving traditional forms of indigenous weaving and other fiber arts, and providing space
      for contemporary artists to collaborate and create.&amp;#160; A companion building to the
      recently built carving studio, the design of the fiber arts studio will pay tribute to the
      Longhouse&amp;#8217;s long-term relationship with the Maori peoples of New Zealand, according
      to Tina Kuckkahn-Miller, director of the Longhouse.</p>
     <p>Creative New Zealand, which operates similarly to the U.S. National Endowment for the Arts,
      is sending a noted designer and sculptor, Lyonel Grant, to work in collaboration with
      architect Johnpaul Jones to design and build the new space. Jones, who also designed the
      Longhouse, is best known for his design of the Smithsonian&amp;#8217;s National Museum of the
      American Indian in Washington, DC.&amp;#160;</p>
     <p>&amp;#160;&amp;#8220;This project is a testament of our commitment to providing a space for
      indigenous art and culture within higher education,&amp;#8221; said Thomas
      &amp;#8216;Les&amp;#8217; Purce, president of The Evergreen State College. &amp;#8220;The
      Longhouse was the first building of its kind on any college campus in the nation, and
      we&amp;#8217;re excited to take this next step.&amp;#8221;&amp;#160;</p>
     <p>Peter Boome, a current student at Evergreen and Salish artist, was inspired by an
      opportunity he had earlier this year to visit a traditional Maori meeting house created by
      Grant in Auckland, New Zealand.&amp;#160;</p>
     <p>&amp;#8220;That building was alive and it told a story. I wanted to be a part of building a
      structure like that, except Salish in origin,&amp;#8221; he said. Boome will be an intern
      during the creation of the fiber arts studio and will add Salish design and environmental
      considerations. The building will blend traditional Maori and Salish
      architecture.&amp;#160;</p>
     <p>The creation of an indigenous arts campus has recently been adopted into the master plan for
      The Evergreen State College.</p>
     <p>&amp;#8220;It&amp;#8217;s vital that we preserve indigenous cultural voices,&amp;#8221; said
      Kuckkahn-Miller.&amp;#160; &amp;#8220;The fiber arts studio will allow a new generation of
      native artists to keep these voices and traditions alive.&amp;#8221;</p>
     <p>To date, the Ford Foundation has invested $1 million in the indigenous arts campus and
      related programming.&amp;#160; &amp;#160;In 2015, the Longhouse will celebrate its twentieth
      anniversary.&amp;#160;</p>

     <p>The Evergreen State College is one of the 332 most environmentally responsible colleges in
      the U.S. and Canada, according to The Princeton Review. The education services company, known
      for its influential college rankings, profiles Evergreen in the fifth annual edition of
      &amp;#8220;The Princeton Review's Guide to 332 Green Colleges."</p>
     <p>&amp;#8220;Green thinking is integrated not only in the way we operate our campus, but in
      everything we do at Evergreen,&amp;#8221; said Scott Morgan, director of sustainability at the
      college. &amp;#8220;Some seventy percent of our curriculum integrates our commitment to the
      environment and sustainability. It's woven into the very fabric of our identity and history as
      an institution.&amp;#8221;</p>
     <p>The Princeton Review chose the schools for this guide based on a survey it conducted in 2013
      of administrators at hundreds of four-year colleges to measure the schools' commitment to the
      environment and to sustainability. The institutional survey included questions on the schools'
      course offerings, campus infrastructure, activities and career preparation.</p>
     <p>The Princeton Review created its "Guide to 332 Green Colleges" in partnership with the
      Center for Green Schools (www.usgbc.org) at the U.S. Green Building Council (USGBC).</p>
     <p>In the guide's profile on Evergreen, The Princeton Review highlights the college&amp;#8217;s
      free bus pass program, which reduces vehicular pollution; innovative heating and water
      conservation systems for campus housing; and the student green energy fee, which enables the
      college to use 100 percent renewable electricity and support hands-on student conservation
      projects.</p>
     <p>"We are pleased to recommend Evergreen to the many students seeking colleges that practice
      and promote environmentally-responsible choices and practices," said Rob Franek, publisher of
      The Princeton Review.</p>
     <p>Franek noted recent survey findings indicating significant interest among college applicants
      in attending "green" colleges. "Among 10,116 college applicants who participated in our 2014
      'College Hopes &amp; Worries Survey,' 61 percent said having information about a
      school&amp;#8217;s commitment to the environment would influence their decision to apply to or
      attend the school," he said.</p>
     <p>The Evergreen State College is a nationally acclaimed public liberal arts and sciences
      college, offering outstanding academics at a moderate cost, according to the Fiske Guide to
      Colleges.</p>

     <p>When U.S. Senator Patty Murray appeared before Lincoln High School in Tacoma Tuesday to
      announce the winner of the Milken Education Award, she said the winner &amp;#8220;knew
      teaching was a creative art,&amp;#8221; and that he &amp;#8220;turns his classroom into a
      courtroom where students debate Supreme Court cases.&amp;#8221;</p>
     <p>That one reference was enough to kick off a cheer, because the entire school knew the award
      was going to Nathan Gibbs-Bowling. &amp;#160;Gibbs-Bowling, who earned an undergraduate degree
      at Evergreen in 2004 and a masters in teaching in 2006, has been teaching government and
      geography at Lincoln for five years.</p>
     <p>The $25,000 award, which is known by some as &amp;#8220;the Oscar of teaching,&amp;#8221;
      goes out annually to about 40 recipients and is considered one of the country&amp;#8217;s
      highest honors in education. &amp;#160;&amp;#160;Gibbs-Bowling is the only recipient this year
      in Washington State.</p>
     <p>Gibbs-Bowling is known for his high expectations and pushing his students to new heights. In
      a recent video posted on the Tacoma school district website, Gibbs-Bowling talked about what
      fuels his passion for teaching.</p>
     <p>&amp;#8220;I get to leave my intellectual and cognitive fingerprints on a hundred kids a
      year, who will be change agents in the community,&amp;#8221; Gibbs-Bowling said.
      &amp;#8220;Poverty and education is a life or death matter. If I am getting kids prepared and
      competitive for college, then I&amp;#8217;m setting them on a trajectory for a better,
      happier, healthier, longer life.&amp;#8221;</p>
     <p>Gibbs-Bowling grew up in the Lincoln High School neighborhood in Tacoma and sees his career
      there as an opportunity to give back to his community.</p>
     <p>&amp;#8220;I think Nate is an outstanding example of the teaching strategies and
      professional disposition we impress upon our teachers at the Masters in Teaching
      program,&amp;#8221; said Sherry Walton, director of the MiT program and a faculty member at
      Evergreen. &amp;#8220;Part of the core of our philosophy is working with kids who are right in
      front of you, because those are the people who will shape the future. We seek to help develop
      teachers like Nate, who can work with any set of kids and engage in them in their learning and
      in their own lives. We&amp;#8217;re very proud of him.&amp;#8221;</p>
     <p>The Milken Educator Award was founded in 1985 by the Milken Family Foundation.&amp;#160;</p>

     <p>Dr. Thomas L. (Les) Purce announced today he will step down at the end of August 2015 from
      his position as president of The Evergreen State College, where he has served since July 1,
      2000. He is the longest serving president among Washington&amp;#8217;s public baccalaureate
      institutions.</p>
     <p>&amp;#8220;Serving as Evergreen&amp;#8217;s president continues to be one of the great joys
      of my life,&amp;#8221; said Dr. Purce. &amp;#8220;The college is fortunate to have
      extraordinary faculty, staff and students. We have accomplished much together.&amp;#8221;</p>
     <p>&amp;#8220;Les has made an enormous contribution not just to The Evergreen State College,
      but to higher education in this state and across the nation,&amp;#8221; said Keith Kessler,
      chair of Evergreen&amp;#8217;s board of trustees. &amp;#8220;Under his leadership, Evergreen
      has updated and enhanced its buildings and technology, sustained the vitality of its
      distinctive interdisciplinary approach to teaching and learning, continued its service to
      students from a wide range of economic and social backgrounds, and adapted to drastic changes
      in state funding for higher education. Les has been an effective leader, ambassador and
      champion for the college and its students.&amp;#8221;</p>
     <p>Evergreen&amp;#8217;s board of trustees will begin a nationwide search process in May
      2014.</p>
     <p>Since opening its doors in 1971, the college has become nationally recognized for its
      innovative academic programs that combine subjects that are traditionally taught separately.
      America&amp;#8217;s top college guides regularly rank Evergreen as one of the
      nation&amp;#8217;s best institutions for its strong academics, nurturing community and
      reasonable cost. Sierra magazine and the Princeton Review have repeatedly named Evergreen as
      one of the top &amp;#8220;green&amp;#8221; colleges in the nation for its commitment to
      sustainability and achievements in sustainable practices, operations, academic programming and
      community outreach.</p>
     <p>Evergreen serves more than 4000 students at its main campus in Olympia, through its Tacoma
      program, and through a unique reservation-based program for Native American students at
      several locations around the Puget Sound.</p>
     <p><br/> Prior to accepting the presidency at The Evergreen State College, Dr. Purce served as
      vice-president of extended university affairs and dean of extended academic programs at
      Washington State University in Pullman, Wash. Between 1989 and 1995, Dr. Purce served in
      several roles at Evergreen, including vice president for college advancement, interim
      president and executive vice president.</p>
     <p>Before coming to Evergreen, Dr. Purce was at Idaho State University as special assistant to
      the president and director of the Research Park and economic development. Dr. Purce, an Idaho
      native, was the first black elected official in the state, serving as city councilman and then
      mayor of Pocatello. He later served as director of Idaho's Departments of Administration and
      Health and Welfare. In the private sector, he served as partner and chief operating officer of
      Power Engineering Inc., one of the fastest growing electrical engineering firms in the
      Northwest.</p>
     <p>Dr. Purce holds a Bachelor of Arts degree in Psychology, a Master of Arts degree in
      Education, and a Doctor of Counselor Education from Idaho State University. He also attended
      Harvard University's Institute for Educational Management. In May 2009, he received an
      honorary Doctor of Humane Letters degree from the University of North Carolina, Asheville
      recognizing his national work promoting public liberal arts. He will receive an honorary
      Doctor of Laws degree from the State University of New York at Geneseo on May 17, 2014.</p>
     <p>Dr. Purce served on the board of directors for the Association of American Colleges and
      Universities for two terms and is a past president of the Council of Public Liberal Arts
      Colleges board of directors. He currently serves as a board member for the Community
      Foundation of South Puget Sound, the Northwest African American Museum, and Washington Campus
      Compact. In addition, he is currently chair of the National Association of Intercollegiate
      Athletics Council of Presidents.</p>

     <p>In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TED has created a program called TEDx. TEDx is a
      program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like
      experience. Our event is called TEDxTheEvergreenStateCollege, where x = independently
      organized TED event. At TEDxTheEvergreenStateCollege, TEDTalk videos and live speakers will
      combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group setting. The TED Conference
      provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events, including ours,
      are self-organized. More information can be found at: <a href="#blogs.evergreen.edu/tedx"

    <content><p>Walking into an office at Olympia&amp;#8217;s Washington Center for the Performing
      Arts a few months ago, KAOS-fm&amp;#8217;s Development Director John Ford saw a box of music
      history DVDs on the desk of the center&amp;#8217;s marketing director, Anne Larsen.&amp;#160;
      His eyes lit up.&amp;#160;</p>
     <p>&amp;#8220;Anne explained the opportunity to bring these films to town, asking how we might
      make it work,&amp;#8221; said Ford. &amp;#160;&amp;#8220;I said, let&amp;#8217;s make KAOS
      your official media partner and bring in faculty at Evergreen. Let&amp;#8217;s build on
      KAOS&amp;#8217; 40 years of bringing America&amp;#8217;s music to local airwaves, and
      punctuate that with local voices.&amp;#160; It&amp;#8217;s a natural partnership for the
      Washington Center, KAOS and Evergreen.&amp;#8221;</p>
     <p>The result is the free film series "America's Music,&amp;#8221; hosted by The Washington
      Center for the Performing Arts, in partnership with KAOS Olympia, The Evergreen State College,
      and Timberland Library.&amp;#160;</p>
     <p>This six-week program, featuring documentary film screenings and scholar-led discussions of
      twentieth-century American popular music, kicks off April 4 through May 2, and one Saturday,
      on April 26, during Olympia's Arts Walk.&amp;#160; It will focus on uniquely American musical
      genres including blues and gospel, Broadway, jazz, bluegrass and country, rock n&amp;#8217;
      roll, mambo, and hip hop. &amp;#160;</p>
     <p>Drew Buchman, a faculty member teaching music Evergreen, along with Ford, will host panel
      discussions after each film with community musicians.</p>
     <p>&amp;#8220;Each panel is designed to function like a class, giving the audience a deeper
      context and perspective about the important role this music plays in our lives,&amp;#8221;
      said Buchman.</p>
     <p>The Center is one of fifty sites nationwide, and the only in the Northwest, selected to host
      this program series. &amp;#8220;America&amp;#8217;s Music&amp;#8221; is a project by the
      Tribeca Film Institute in collaboration with the American Library Association, Tribeca
      Flashpoint, and the Society for American Music, supported by the National Endowment for the
      Humanities.</p>
     <p>&amp;#8220;We are thrilled to participate in this exciting program that will help introduce
      different types of music, show how modern music has been influenced by older styles, and
      bridge gaps among generations&amp;#8221; said Jill Barnes, executive director at the
      center.&amp;#160;</p>
     <p>&amp;#8220;America&amp;#8217;s Music,&amp;#8221; designed for a general audience, will
      introduce genres of twentieth-century American popular music that are deeply connected to the
      history, culture, and geography of the United States. Older and younger Americans alike will
      have the chance to recognize how the cultural landscape that they take for granted today has
      been influenced by the development of the popular musical forms discussed in this series.</p>
     The web page at <a href="http://www.americasmusic.tribecafilminstitute.org/"
      >americasmusic.tribecafilminstitute.org</a> includes additional information on the series as
     well as scholar essays, suggested readings, discussion points and additional films on the
     genres. All programs are from 6:30 to 8:30 p.m. and will take place at The Washington Center,
     512 Washington St SE, in downtown Olympia.</content>

     <p>Some 100 employers eager to connect with potential employees will be on hand at the April 8
      Career and Internship Fair, co-sponsored between Saint Martin&amp;#8217;s University and The
      Evergreen State College. The fair takes place from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. at Marcus Pavilion on the
      Saint Martin&amp;#8217;s University campus, 5300 Pacific Ave. SE. Admission is free and the
      community is encouraged to attend.</p>
     <p>Private sector, non-profit, and government employers will attend, ranging from the Nisqually
      Land Trust to local radio stations and school districts to the U.S. Navy. Some employers plan
      to conduct on-site interviews. Several Washington colleges will also attend, representing
      their graduate programs.</p>
     <p>&amp;#8220;This is a great opportunity for Evergreen students, alumni, and community members
      to meet with a large number of employers, all gathered in one location, looking to hire new
      employees,&amp;#8221; said Steve Laing, Director of Evergreen&amp;#8217;s Career Development
      and Planning Center.</p>
     <p>&amp;#8220;Even if you&amp;#8217;re not currently looking for a job, there isn&amp;#8217;t a
      better place to meet face-to-face with so many potential employers, to introduce yourself, to
      gather information, and to learn about the types of positions these employers are seeking to
      fill,&amp;#8221; said Laing.</p>
     <p>Laing recommends that job-seekers come prepared by wearing appropriate business attire,
      bringing multiple copies of resumes and brushing up on interview skills in advance. Career
      counselors will also be available for students and alumni who wish to have their resumes
      reviewed by an expert.</p>

     <p>Some 350 low-income Washington state students, many of whom will be the first in their
      families to graduate college, will meet at The Evergreen State College on March 20 to hear
      from U.S. Congressmen Derek Kilmer and Denny Heck, as part of the Washington TRiO Civic
      Leadership Conference.</p>
     <p>The state-wide meeting brings students participating in the federally funded TRiO
      college-prep program together on the Evergreen campus for workshops and discussions on how to
      succeed in education.</p>
     <p>&amp;#8220;Evergreen prides itself on being a state leader in serving a wide range of
      students, including low-income individuals, first-generation college students, and individuals
      with disabilities,&amp;#8221; said Evergreen President Thomas &amp;#8220;Les&amp;#8221; Purce.
      &amp;#8220;It is an honor to welcome TRiO students and give them a taste of what&amp;#8217;s
      so important about higher education.&amp;#8221;</p>
     <p>After an opening address by Purce and keynote speech by Kilmer, students will take part in a
      variety of workshops held by local leaders and faculty from Evergreen and other Washington
      state colleges. Students will also hear a panel of state legislators, along with closing
      addresses by motivational speaker Luis Ortega, State Representative Chris Reykdal and Denny
      Heck.</p>
     <p>Usually held once a year at the Capital Campus, this is the first year the Washington TRiO
      Civic Leadership Conference has been held at Evergreen.</p>
     <p>&amp;#8220;Hosting the conference at Evergreen, which is the four-year institution with
      highest percentage of TRiO-eligible students in the state, underlines our commitment to
      providing access to higher education,&amp;#8221; said Felix Braffith, director of student
      support services at Evergreen.</p>
     <p>Born out of the civil rights movement and the war on poverty, TRiO programs are designed to
      identify and provide services for individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds for high school
      and college students. Evergreen has managed TRiO programs for more than 35 years. The first
      grant, in 1977, was to support students in the Tacoma School District. In 2012, Evergreen
      received its most recent grant to serve students at Clover Park High School.</p>
     <p>&amp;#8220;That so many legislators, advocates and educators want to engage and talk to
      these students shows they matter,&amp;#8221; said Braffith. &amp;#8220;Higher-education
      institutions from around the state want them to succeed, get their degrees, and become leaders
      in the community.&amp;#8221;</p>

     <div>One of The Evergreen State College&amp;#8217;s most influential alums, Joe Dear
      &amp;#8216;77, will be remembered by his family and friends at a celebration of his life on
      April 5 in the Library Lobby of the Olympia campus from 2 to 3:30 p.m. Dear died on February
      26 in Sacramento after a long battle with prostate cancer. He was 62.</div>
     <div>
      <p>&amp;#8220;Joe was living proof of the value of an Evergreen education,&amp;#8221; said
       Evergreen President Thomas L. &amp;#8220;Les&amp;#8221; Purce. &amp;#8220;He always said
       Evergreen taught him how to learn and how to solve problems, which is exactly what he
       did.&amp;#8221;</p>
      <p>An accomplished public servant at the federal and state level, Dear was noted for restoring
       to solvency the California Public Employees Retirement system in the wake of the financial
       crisis. Calpers, the nation&amp;#8217;s largest public pension fund, was deemed
       &amp;#8220;unsustainable&amp;#8221; by then-governor Arnold Schwarzenegger at the end of
       2008. Dear shifted the fund&amp;#8217;s investment strategy and over five years brought the
       fund from $183.3 billion to $283.9 billion in assets.</p>
      <p>Dear also served as head of Washington State&amp;#8217;s public pension fund, as head of
       the federal Occupation Health and Safety Administration under President Clinton, and as chief
       of staff to Washington Governor Gary Locke.</p>
      <p>Dear was committed to &amp;#8220;making government work better through innovative public
       policy and sheer force of will,&amp;#8221; said Calpers in a statement on Dear&amp;#8217;s
       death.</p>
      <p>A lifelong advocate for Evergreen, he endowed a scholarship and served on the college's
       board of governors from 2002 to 2008. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkPjT0ywoVA"
        >Dear frequently cited his Evergreen education</a> as essential to helping him prepare for
       career success.</p>
      <p>In his honor, Dear&amp;#8217;s family will receive the newly created Joe Dear Distinguished
       Alumni Award, presented by The Evergreen State College at the President&amp;#8217;s
       Recognition Dinner at the college May 13. This award will recognize outstanding achievement
       among Evergreen alumni.</p>
      <p>The April 5 service is open to the community. A reception will follow the event. The family
       of Joe Dear requests in lieu of flowers that a contribution be made to the <a

     <p>Hollie Wagner never thought she would be able to afford a college education that would allow
      her to follow her true passion.&amp;#160; Today, she is studying film and philosophy at The
      Evergreen State College thanks to an undergraduate transfer scholarship from the Jack Kent
      Cooke Foundation.&amp;#160;&amp;#160;</p>
     <p>Jack Kent Cooke was a Canadian entrepreneur who owned the Chrysler Building in New York,
      several news outlets and sports teams, including the Washington Redskins and the Los Angeles
      Lakers. After his death in 1997, Cooke willed his fortune to his foundation, which has awarded
      more than $100 million in scholarships to about 1,900 high-performing, high-need students
      since it was formed in 2000.</p>
     <p>Wagner&amp;#8217;s advice to financially struggling students? &amp;#8220;There are all sorts
      of scholarships available and people just don&amp;#8217;t realize it. Students assume a
      defeatist attitude and think they&amp;#8217;ll never get a scholarship,&amp;#8221; said
      Wagner. &amp;#8220;Go apply for them, because the money&amp;#8217;s out there.&amp;#8221;</p>
     <p>After experience working as a production assistant for several films, Wagner attended Oakton
      Community College in the Chicago suburbs. There, her passion for academia and activism
      blossomed. Her work combining the arts with social justice earned her awards, and one of her
      philosophy professors nominated her for the JKC Scholarship. After the lengthy application
      process, she was awarded a $30,000 scholarship, with the possibility of renewal.</p>
     <p>With the scholarship money in hand, Wagner feared she would finally have to choose between
      her two academic passions: film and philosophy.</p>
     <p>&amp;#8220;My philosophy professors were encouraging me to enroll in a rigorous philosophy
      program because they knew I&amp;#8217;d succeed. But I didn&amp;#8217;t know if
      that&amp;#8217;s what I wanted to do,&amp;#8221; Wagner recalls. &amp;#8220;The scholarship
      board kept encouraging me to follow whatever my passion was, which was this intersection
      between philosophy and film. Evergreen is the only college where I&amp;#8217;m really able to
      do that.&amp;#8221;</p>
     <p>Wagner happily calls Olympia and The Evergreen State College her new home, making her the
      first Jack Kent Cooke Scholar to attend Evergreen. In true Evergreen fashion, she is in an
      interdisciplinary philosophy course this fall, with plans of focusing on film next year while
      furthering her philosophy work independently with faculty.</p>
     <p>&amp;#8220;This scholarship changed my life,&amp;#8221; Wagner says. &amp;#8220;There are
      people who have money that are working within the system who want to give it to you to help
      turn the system around. You just have to go out there and get it.&amp;#8221;</p>

     <p>Twelve out of 26 student applicants at The Evergreen State College have received a 2014
      Benjamin A. Gilman Study Abroad Scholarship, winning a total of $46,500, with individual
      students winning $3000 to $5000 for a year&amp;#8217;s study overseas.</p>
     <p>Applicants from all over the U.S. compete for these federally funded scholarships.
      Evergreen&amp;#8217;s 46.15 percent success rate places the college third among all competing
      colleges and universities in the nation. UC Berkeley and Syracuse University, with 35,000 and
      20,000 students respectively, came in first and second place. Evergreen has 4,400
      students.</p>
     <p>Michael Clifthorne, Evergreen &amp;#8216;s academic advisor for international programs,
      believes Evergreen&amp;#8217;s unique approach to study-abroad programs keeps the small
      liberal arts and sciences college competitive against universities several times the size.</p>
     <p>&amp;#8220;The study-abroad programs at most schools focus on traditional European
      destinations, whereas Evergreen faculty focus on a much broader scope of countries, especially
      Latin America,&amp;#8221; Clifthorne said. &amp;#8220;The structure for the programs is
      different, focusing on social justice and community organizations, giving students real
      connections with real people on the ground.&amp;#8221;</p>
     <p>One scholarship winner did admit to hesitation before pursuing the award. &amp;#8220;At
      first, I didn&amp;#8217;t want to apply because I was intimidated by the competition. However,
      when most of my peers who applied won, my perspective dramatically changed and I decided to
      apply,&amp;#8221; said Evergreen student Quinn Snow. Snow is using the Gilman Scholarship to
      fund an independent study project in Japan.</p>
     <p>Other Evergreen Gilman recipients are pursuing independent studies in studying Arabic while
      volunteering in Syrian refugee camps in Jordan and collecting folk songs while teaching music
      to children in South Africa. Other winners are participating in Evergreen faculty-led
      programs, including the study of Quechua culture, language, and landscape in Peru. Another
      program is studying animal behavior and zoology in the tropical rainforest of Ecuador, making
      comparisons to the temperate rainforest of the Pacific Northwest.</p>
     <p>Clifthorne says the Evergreen academic advising office&amp;#8217;s commitment to encourage
      students comes from a passionate belief in what study abroad can do in a student&amp;#8217;s
      life.</p>
     <p>&amp;#8220;Study abroad takes us out of our comfort zone. Students return transformed,
      especially students who are the first in their families to attend college,&amp;#8221;
      Clifthorne said. &amp;#8220;After working and studying in such a different setting then
      they&amp;#8217;ve previously experienced, students are rewarded with a fresh, vibrant
      perspective on living.&amp;#8221;</p>
     <p>The Benjamin A. Gilman Scholarship for Study Abroad was founded in 2000 as a part of the
      International Academic Opportunity Act and named after U.S. Congressman Ben Gilman. The
      scholarship is currently administered by the non-profit Institute for International Education
      and funded by the Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs at the U.S. Department of
      State.</p>

    <content>The stories of local Japanese Americans who were incarcerated in Idaho concentration
     camps during World War II are the subject of a talk by Tom Ikeda, founder and executive
     director of Densho: The Japanese American Legacy Project, on Thursday, February 27th, at 7:00
     p.m. at the Longhouse Cultural Center on the Evergreen campus in Olympia. Admission is free and
     open to the public. <p>Ikeda&amp;#8217;s presentation, &amp;#8220;When Citizenship
      Didn&amp;#8217;t Matter: Personal Stories from Japanese Americans Incarcerated during World
      War II,&amp;#8221; will explore issues of democracy, intolerance, wartime hysteria and civil
      rights, based on hundreds of oral histories conducted by Densho over the last 18 years.</p>
     <p>Ikeda was born and raised in Seattle. His parents and grandparents were incarcerated during
      World War II at Minidoka, Idaho. A former manager at Microsoft, Ikeda graduated from the
      University of Washington. He has received numerous awards for his historical contributions,
      including the Humanities Washington Award for outstanding achievement in the public
      humanities, the National JACL Japanese American of the Biennium award for Education, and the
      Microsoft Alumni Fellows Award.</p>
     <p>Ikeda&amp;#8217;s presentation takes place under the banner of the Willi Unsoeld Seminar, a
      speaker series honoring Unsoeld, a founding faculty member of The Evergreen State College.</p>
     <p>&amp;#8220;Each year, faculty, staff, and students focus on a theme linked to the
      college&amp;#8217;s core values,&amp;#8221; said Evergreen faculty member Nancy Koppelman.
      &amp;#8220;This year, the theme is 'listening', and why listening is essential to
      education.&amp;#8221;</p>
     <p>Evergreen launched the academic year by assigning NPR Story Corps creator Dave
      Isay&amp;#8217;s book, Listening is an Act of Love, to all students, and he spoke on campus in
      September 2013. Ikeda&amp;#8217;s presentation continues and elaborates on the theme.</p>
     <p>The Willi Unsoeld Seminar honors the philosopher, educator and mountaineer who helped
      Evergreen develop its emphasis on student-directed learning, interdisciplinary programs,
      collaboration and personal responsibility. Unsoeld lost his life in an avalanche during a
      mountaineering expedition with Evergreen students on Mt. Rainier on March 4, 1979.</p>
     <p>The Evergreen State College is located at 2700 Evergreen Parkway in Olympia. Buses #41 and
      #48 from downtown Olympia stop at campus every 15 minutes. Parking is $2.00.</p></content>

     Pacific Northwest, The Evergreen State College has named former Makah tribal chairman Micah
     McCarty to the new post of Special Assistant to the President for Tribal Government
     Relations.<br/> &amp;#160;<br/> &amp;#8220;Micah is a noted tribal leader and artist, with
     great experience in health care, cultural survival, treaty resources, sustainable development,
     and energy issues,&amp;#8221; said Evergreen President Thomas L. &amp;#8220;Les&amp;#8221;
     Purce.&amp;#160; &amp;#8220;We know his expertise and passion will help us strengthen our
     relationships with Native communities.&amp;#8221;<br/> &amp;#160;<br/> McCarty is working with
     the Washington state-based Tribal Leaders Congress on Indian Education to review curricula and
     educational pathways for Native students, from the Head Start program up to the PhD
     level.&amp;#160; McCarty has also established a relationship between local tribal governments
     and the college&amp;#8217;s newly formed Center for Sustainable Infrastructure to improve
     tribal water systems.<br/> &amp;#160;<br/> Some 4.5 percent of current Evergreen students are
     Native American.&amp;#160; Evergreen hosts the Longhouse Education and Cultural Center, the
     first Native longhouse built on a public college campus in the U.S.&amp;#160; The college also
     offers a master of public administration degree with a concentration on tribal governance, a
     program of study on Native American and world indigenous peoples, and sponsors a
     reservation-based program where classes are offered locally and the study topics are determined
     in partnership with tribal authorities. <br/> &amp;#160;<br/> McCarty previously served on the
     National Ocean Council Governance Coordination Committee and former Governor Christine

     what Native communities have to offer Evergreen.<br/> &amp;#160;<br/> &amp;#8220;Tribal
     governments are great educational resources, because of their growing diversity in expertise.
     It only seems logical that we find more ways to work together for the advancement of education
     as a whole,&amp;#8221; said McCarty.&amp;#160; &amp;#8220;Long-term tribal leadership is based
     on interdisciplinary experience and creative thinking&amp;#8212;both of which are great

     <p><strong>(Olympia, Wash.)</strong> The Evergreen State College will deepen and expand its
      engagement with local schools, non-profit organizations and government agencies via the
      Community Opportunities and Internships Fair on January 29th. This event, now in its
       22<sup>nd</sup> year, links students and community members with internship and employment
      opportunities with more than 70 local organizations.</p>
     <p>&amp;#8220;This fair is all about connecting students with the community. Internships and
      volunteering are so integrated with the college&amp;#8217;s learning model, and this event
      provides students with those connections,&amp;#8221; said Katherine McGee, program coordinator
      of academic advising. &amp;#8220;The community gives to students in so many ways; volunteering
      is a great way for students to give back to the community. Many of the organizations that come
      to the fair are small operations that would struggle without student interns.&amp;#8221;</p>
     <p>The Community Opportunities and Internships Fair is a part of the longstanding role
      volunteering and internships play in the Evergreen curriculum, with many classes and programs
      requiring community service. Many organizations, such as Thurston Community Television, return
      every year to scout new student talent, which TCTV needs in order to produce programs for the
      community. Evergreen students contribute more than 12,000 hours a year to Thurston County
      organizations, according to an Evergreen economic impact assessment conducted in 2013.</p>
     <p>Some of the organizations that will be at the fair include SafePlace, Hands On
      Children&amp;#8217;s Museum, Peace Corps, Garfield Elementary, Olympic National Park, and
      GRuB.</p>
     <p>The fair is hosted by the academic advising office in partnership with the Center for
      Community Based Learning and Action and the student employment office. The event takes place
      on January 29<sup>th</sup> from 12 noon to 3 p.m. in the lobby of the library building at The
      Evergreen State College, located at 2700 Evergreen Parkway NW in Olympia.</p>

     <p><strong>(Olympia, Wash.)</strong> The Evergreen State College Gallery kicks off the new year
      with Selected Druckworks, a multi-media survey of the work of Johanna Drucker, renowned
      artist, writer, typographic poet, scholar, and critic. Drucker&amp;#8217;s work has been
      displayed at the National Museum of Women in the Arts, Columbia University, and the Art
      Institute of Chicago.</p>
     <p>This exhibit focuses on book art, a field which Drucker pioneers, showcasing typographic,
      literary, and visual art through a series of intricate, hand-made books. Drucker&amp;#8217;s
      sketches and watercolors beautifully articulate the female form, and line the walls of the
      space. Screens will also display the artist&amp;#8217;s early slide show work, along with
      Drucker&amp;#8217;s talk from the Fall Gallery Artist Lecture Series. The work spans
      Drucker&amp;#8217;s long career, ranging from the early 1970&amp;#8217;s to today.</p>
     <p>&amp;#8220;The wide variety of mediums provide so many layers for people to
      explore,&amp;#8221; said Anne Friedman, Gallery Director and Curator. &amp;#8220;There are
      also many interesting themes, such as femininity, gender identity and the body, politics, at
      play in this excellent, varied work.&amp;#8221;</p>
     <p>The exhibit opens Monday, January 13, 2014, at The Evergreen State College, on the ground
      floor of the library building, 2700 Evergreen Parkway, in Olympia. The exhibition continues
      through February 28 and is open to the public. For more details, go to <a
       href="http://www.evergreen.edu/gallery/">http://www.evergreen.edu/gallery/</a>, or call the

     <p>How to improve educational success for Native Americans will be the theme of a lecture by
      Brian Cladoosby, current president of the National Congress of American Indians, and chairman
      of the Swinomish Indian Senate. He will speak on &amp;#8220;Tribal Self-Governance and Indian
      Education&amp;#8221; at The Evergreen State College, on Wednesday, February 26, in the
      Longhouse Education and Cultural Center, from 3:30 to 5:30 p.m.</p>
     <p>Cladoosby&amp;#8217;s lecture marks an enhanced effort by Evergreen to develop curricula and
      programs that meet the needs of Native students. Some 4.5 percent of current Evergreen
      students are Native American. The Longhouse Education and Cultural Center is the first Native
      longhouse built on a public college campus in the U.S. The college also offers a master of
      public administration degree with a concentration on tribal governance, a program of study on
      Native American and world indigenous peoples, and sponsors a reservation-based program where
      classes are offered locally and the study topics are determined in partnership with tribal
      authorities.</p>
     <p>&amp;#8220;We&amp;#8217;ve come a long way in collaboration with Native communities, and we
      want to do more,&amp;#8221; said Evergreen Provost Michael Zimmerman. Zimmerman cited the
      recent appointment of former Makah tribal chairman Micah McCarty to the new post of special
      assistant to the president for tribal government relations as a vital part of the
      college&amp;#8217;s reinvigorated outreach.</p>
     <p>Cladoosby&amp;#8217;s visit to Evergreen will help faculty, students and the public
      understand what&amp;#8217;s at stake as statistics continue to show Native students falling
      behind in high school and college graduation rates.</p>
     <p>&amp;#8220;Chairman Cladoosby&amp;#8217;s stature as a national figure and his ideas on how
      to provide quality education that respects and addresses unique Native cultural and linguistic
      needs make him an especially important interlocutor on these issues,&amp;#8221; said McCarty.
      &amp;#8220;He&amp;#8217;s an exemplary leader, and a collaborative partner for
      Evergreen.&amp;#8221;</p>
     <p>The National Congress of American Indians, founded in 1944, is the oldest and largest
      American Indian and Alaska Native organization, serving the broad interests of tribal
      governments and communities. As one of the most senior tribal political leaders in the Pacific
      Northwest, Cladoosby has been influential on Indian governance, environmental protection and
      educational advocacy for decades. He is the president of the Association of Washington Tribes,
      and co-speaker of the Coast Salish Gathering, which comprises British Columbia First Nations
      and Western Washington tribes.</p>
     <p>The lecture is free and open to the public. Parking is $2.00. The Evergreen State College is
      located at 2700 Evergreen Parkway NW, in Olympia.</p>

      <p>The Evergreen State College is one of the 332 most environmentally responsible colleges in
       the U.S. and Canada, according to The Princeton Review.&amp;#160; The education services
       company, known for its influential college rankings, profiles Evergreen in the fifth annual
       edition of &amp;#8220;The Princeton Review's Guide to 332 Green Colleges."</p>
      <p>&amp;#8220;Green thinking is integrated not only in the way we operate our campus, but in
       everything we do at Evergreen,&amp;#8221; said Scott Morgan, director of sustainability at
       the college.&amp;#160; &amp;#8220;Some seventy percent of our curriculum integrates our
       commitment to the environment and sustainability.&amp;#160; It's woven into the very fabric
       of our identity and history as an institution.&amp;#8221;</p>
      <p>The Princeton Review chose the schools for this guide based on a survey it conducted in
       2013 of administrators at hundreds of four-year colleges to measure the schools' commitment
       to the environment and to sustainability.&amp;#160; The institutional survey included
       questions on the schools' course offerings, campus infrastructure, activities and career
       preparation.&amp;#160;</p>
      <p>The Princeton Review created its "Guide to 332 Green Colleges" in partnership with the
       Center for Green Schools (<a href="http://www.usgbc.org/">www.usgbc.org</a>) at the U.S.
       Green Building Council (USGBC).</p>
      <p>In the guide's profile on Evergreen, The Princeton Review highlights the
       college&amp;#8217;s free bus pass program, which reduces vehicular pollution; innovative
       heating and water conservation systems for campus housing; and the student green energy fee,
       which enables the college to use 100 percent renewable electricity and support hands-on
       student conservation projects.&amp;#160;</p>
      <p>"We are pleased to recommend Evergreen to the many students seeking colleges that practice
       and promote environmentally-responsible choices and practices," said Rob Franek, publisher of
       The Princeton Review.</p>
      <p>Franek noted recent survey findings indicating significant interest among college
       applicants in attending "green" colleges. "Among 10,116 college applicants who participated
       in our 2014 'College Hopes &amp; Worries Survey,' 61 percent said having information about a
       school&amp;#8217;s commitment to the environment would influence their decision to apply to
       or attend the school," he said.&amp;#160;</p>
      <p>The Evergreen State College is a nationally acclaimed public liberal arts and sciences
       college, offering outstanding academics at a moderate cost, according to the Fiske Guide to
       Colleges.</p>

     <h2>Film of Epic Climb Featured at Unsoeld Seminar</h2>
     <p>(Olympia, Wash.) A film and discussion about the greatest Himalayan climb in American
      mountaineering history will be the feature of this year&amp;#8217;s Unsoeld Seminar November
      20 at 7 p.m. at the Washington Center for the Performing Arts in Olympia.</p>
     <p>&amp;#8220;High and Hallowed: Everest 1963&amp;#8221; tells the story of Willi Unsoeld and
      Tom Hornbein&amp;#8217;s pioneering ascent of the West Ridge of Mt. Everest, and examines the
      risk and adventure that drew them to the summit. Filmmakers David Morton, Jake Norton and Jim
      Aikman will join Tom Hornbein onstage after the film to discuss the film with the audience.
      This event is free.</p>
     <p>Willi Unsoeld was a philosopher, mountaineer and founding faculty member at The Evergreen

     <p><strong>(Olympia, Wash.)</strong> Washington state high school seniors now have a valuable
      new reason to think about liberal arts: several thousand dollars in scholarships.</p>
     <p>A group of top Washington state public and private colleges and universities, the Washington
      Consortium for the Liberal Arts, has just announced a scholarship essay contest for Washington
      state high school seniors enrolled during the 2013-14 academic year. The first prize winner
      will receive a $3,000 scholarship to a Washington Consortium for the Liberal Arts (WaCLA)
      school, the second prize is a $2,000 scholarship, and third prize offers $1,000.</p>
     <p>&amp;#8220;We want to help focus attention on the power and value of the liberal
      arts,&amp;#8221; said Michael Zimmerman, vice-president for academic affairs at The Evergreen
      State College. &amp;#8220;A solid grounding in liberal arts is a foundation for career
      success, whether in science, business, technology or other areas. It&amp;#8217;s also
      essential to a strong democracy.&amp;#8221;</p>
     <p>Schools in the consortium include the University of Washington, The Evergreen State College,
      Washington State University, Whitman College, South Puget Sound Community College, Eastern
      Washington University and several others throughout the state.</p>
     <p>The essay contest asks participants to discuss the relationship between the liberal arts and
      democratic principles, in no more than 500 words. More information and submission details can
      be found at https://collab.evergreen.edu/hsessay . The deadline for submissions is Friday,
      January 31, 2014 at 5:00 p.m. PST. Contest winners will be announced in mid-March.</p>

     <p><strong>(Olympia, Wash.)</strong> According to infrastructure experts, the U.S. will need to
      spend some $3.6 trillion by 2020 on our nation&amp;#8217;s energy, transportation water and
      waste systems. Will we spend that money wisely, investing in creative new approaches and
      sustainable innovation which will be better for the environment and cheaper for
      tax-payers?</p>
     <p>With the goal of creating innovative solutions to these massive public works challenges, The
      Evergreen State College has created the new Center for Sustainable Infrastructure. Based at
      the college&amp;#8217;s Olympia campus, the center will link regional innovators, advocate
      sustainable best practices and develop skilled professionals who will put these principles
      into infrastructure development.</p>
     <p>&amp;#8220;Just to keep our economy working is going to require that we invest hundreds of
      billions of dollars on infrastructure along the Pacific Coast in the next few
      decades,&amp;#8221; said Rhys Roth, the center&amp;#8217;s director.</p>
     <p>&amp;#8220;There is an urgent need to bring world-class innovation, new tools, and
      sustainability excellence to our infrastructure planning and investment. The Northwest can be
      a national and global leader in sustainable infrastructure, and the center will help to make
      that happen,&amp;#8221; Roth said.</p>
     <p>The Pacific Northwest-based Bullitt Foundation, which supports sustainable development in
      the region, announced a $20,000 grant last week to help the initial launch of the center.</p>
     <p>In addition to being a clearinghouse for best sustainable practices and an advising center
      for agencies, utilities and tribes managing infrastructure, the center will give graduate
      students from the college&amp;#8217;s Master of Public Administration program opportunities to
      research, analyze and design infrastructure project proposals.</p>
     <p>&amp;#8220;At a time when huge investments in infrastructure are critical and when we need
      to find ways to moderate our environmental footprint, the work of the center is of particular
      importance,&amp;#8221; said Evergreen Provost and Vice-President for Academic Affairs Michael
      Zimmerman. &amp;#8220;The opportunity it will provide for students to become involved in such
      groundbreaking research is truly exciting.&amp;#8221;</p>

     <p>(<strong>Olympia, Wash.)</strong>&amp;#160; One of the Pacific Northwest&amp;#8217;s leading
      Native artists, from a family long associated with Evergreen, is the subject of a richly
      illustrated new book, <em>A Totem Pole History:&amp;#160; the Work of Lummi Carver Joe
       Hillaire</em>.&amp;#160; The inaugural release of the book will be hosted by members of
      &amp;#8220;Creativity and Diversity in American Culture: Art and Narrative in Response to
      Place,&amp;#8221; December 3 at the College.</p>
     <p>Lummi elder Pauline Hillaire writes about her father&amp;#8217;s legacy as one of the most
      influential Coast Salish artists of the twentieth century.&amp;#160; The book includes
      photographs of Joe Hillaire&amp;#8217;s most significant totem poles, along with essays from
      contributors on Coast Salish art history, pigment technology, oral history, intercultural
      relations and the central role of art in Coast Salish life.</p>
     <p>Joe Hillaire&amp;#8217;s daughter, Mary Ellen Hillaire, was a founding faculty member of
      Evergreen who spearheaded the development of the College&amp;#8217;s Native American studies
      programs in 1972.&amp;#160; She also inspired the creation of Evergreen&amp;#8217;s
      &amp;#8220;House of Welcome&amp;#8221; Longhouse Education and Cultural Center, the first
      building of its kind on any college campus in the U.S.</p>
     <p>&amp;#8220;The Hillaire family has played a special role in the development of Native arts,
      culture, and education on our campus,&amp;#8221; said Evergreen faculty member Rebecca
      Chamberlain.&amp;#160; &amp;#8220;This is a wonderful occasion to let people know about this
      history.&amp;#8221;</p>
     <p>Lummi/Haida carver Felix Solomon, editor Gregory Fields, and others associated with the
      publication will present images and readings from the book and its accompanying video and
      audio CDs at the December 3 event, which will take place at 3 p.m. in Seminar Building Two,
      Room C1105 at The Evergreen State College, 2700 Evergreen Parkway NW in Olympia. Copies of the
      book will be available for purchase.&amp;#160; Additional background on author Pauline
      Hillaire can be found at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXwdDpwP5Oo"

     <p>(Olympia, Wash.)&amp;#160; Harbor residents can enroll in a unique college program taught by
      top-level faculty from The Evergreen State College at Grays Harbor College this winter.</p>
     <p>Community health expert Nancy Anderson and historian Frances Rains will lead
      &amp;#8220;Health Inequality:&amp;#160; Telling the Story and Changing It.&amp;#8221; This
      program focuses on the region&amp;#8217;s European settlement and Native people, examining how
      health, well-being and sustainability can be improved for all people of the Salish
      Sea.&amp;#160; Successful completion of the winter and spring quarters of the program is worth
      16 credits.</p>
     <p>&amp;#8220;Even though this is a three-quarter program, it&amp;#8217;s certainly okay to
      take one or two quarters and still get a lot from the class,&amp;#8221; said
      Evergreen&amp;#8217;s dean for evening and weekend studies, Sarah Ryan.&amp;#160;
      &amp;#8220;Students who are new to Evergreen can register in person at the Olympia campus
      starting December 16.&amp;#8221;</p>
     <p>Started in 2000, Evergreen&amp;#8217;s Grays Harbor program was designed to give local
      community college graduates the opportunity to earn a bachelor&amp;#8217;s degree without
      having to leave the area.&amp;#160; Classes take place on weekends and are taught by Evergreen
      faculty on the Grays Harbor College campus.</p>
     <p>The focus of the program changes from year to year but centers on interdisciplinary
      management, leadership, and the health of individuals, communities, and organizations.
      Students benefit from meaningful instruction as they develop critical thinking and analytical
      skills, refine problem-solving techniques, and become effective team players.</p>
     <p>The program has been the springboard for some notable published work by Harbor
      students.&amp;#160; &amp;#8220;Telling Our Stories:&amp;#160; Voices of Grays
      Harbor,&amp;#8221; is an anthology of original essays, oral histories and poetry by local
      residents, who took the &amp;#8220;&amp;#8220;Telling Our Stories&amp;#8221; 2011-12 program,
      which focused on local history, creative writing and community studies.</p>

    <content>Olympia, (Wash),&amp;#160; Evergreen&amp;#8217;s new student trustee, Emily Dunn-Wilder
     is all about food.<br/> &amp;#160;<br/> Since enrolling at The Evergreen State College in 2012,
     Dunn-Wilder has not only created The Evergreen Food Guide, she also coordinates the
     college&amp;#8217;s Shellfish Club and organized the 2015 Evergreen Earth Day. But she may be
     best known in Olympia for her collaborative work with the Evergreen administration, its campus
     food vendor Aramark, and two campus cafes, to commit the college to the national Real Food
     Challenge. Last April Evergreen became the 32nd college in the nation to join the student-led
     movement, which aims to increase the amount of locally sourced, organic and humane foods served
     in college dining halls.<br/> &amp;#160;<br/> Last month, Dunn-Wilder was appointed by
     Washington Governor Jay Inslee to the college&amp;#8217;s Board of Trustees, where she will
     serve as the student trustee for the next year. <br/> &amp;#160;<br/> Dunn-Wilder, a Washington
     native from Whidbey Island, credits her upbringing with the values and skillset that led her to
     Evergreen. &amp;#8220;South Whidbey Island is a very artistic community,&amp;#8221; she said.
     &amp;#8220;I grew up in the theatre; my sister acted locally. My mother was a music therapist
     and my father was a child and family therapist, which meant I got lots of skills in healthy
     communication growing up. I learned how to compromise and see the other person&amp;#8217;s
     perspective.&amp;#8221;<br/> &amp;#160;<br/> Those skills served her well in becoming a student
     leader at Evergreen, but, she said, &amp;#8220;There's a lot of work to do, to make a great
     thing even better.&amp;#8221;<br/> &amp;#160;<br/> After graduation in June 2016, Dunn-Wilder,
     who is currently enrolled in the Terroir program, focused on the geological, political,
     environmental, social, artistic, and historical factors relating to foods grown around the
     world, hopes to continue her education at the University of Gastronomic Sciences in Northern
     Italy. She plans to study food culture and communication.</content>

     Evergreen State College, the Cal Anderson Memorial Lecture Series.<br/> The series, which has
     brought such notable authors as Kenji Yoshino and Blanche Cook and filmmaker Wendy Jo Carlton
     to Olympia, honors Washington State's first openly gay state legislator.<br/> &amp;#160;<br/>
     Jonathan Katz, Ph.D., chair of the Art Department and director of Visual Studies Doctoral
     Program&amp;#160; at the University at Buffalo (SUNY), prominent LGTBQ activist and co-curator
     of the exhibit currently at the Tacoma Art Museum (TAM), Art AIDS America will spend November
     30 and December 1 in the South Puget Sound discussing art, AIDS,&amp;#160; LGTBQ issues and how
     they intersect.<br/>
     <br/> On November 30, Katz will offer a talk to Evergreen students, faculty and the general
     public entitled "How AIDS Changed American Art."&amp;#160; The lecture will be held on the
     Olympia campus, in the Communications Building Recital Hall at 5:30pm. In this lecture, Katz
     argues that AIDS has been the great, albeit repressed, motor behind the development
     of&amp;#160; American art over the last several decades. Instead of seeing AIDS as a tragic
     tangent in the formation of our common culture, Katz argues that strategies born of AIDS
     continue to guide American art even up to the present day.<br/> &amp;#160;<br/> The following
     morning Katz will lead students and faculty from Evergreen&amp;#8217;s Tacoma Program and
     Olympia programs on a curated tour of the TAM exhibit, underscoring the argument in front of
     defining works of art.<br/> Cal Anderson served from 1987 to 1995 in the Washington state
     legislature, first as a state representative and later as a state senator. He remained a public
     servant until his death in 1995 from AIDS.&amp;#160; A Vietnam-era veteran, Anderson was
     awarded two Bronze Stars and four U.S. Army Commendation Medals. <br/> &amp;#160;<br/> The Cal
     Anderson Memorial Lecture Series is a forum organized by Evergreen to capture the spirit of
     public policy reasoning and ideas that marked Cal Anderson's career. Known in his later life
     for AIDS and equal-rights legislation, Anderson also worked tirelessly for campaign finance and
     regulatory reform, veterans' issues, environmental protection and open access to government.
     <br/> Art AIDS America is organized by Tacoma Art Museum in partnership with The Bronx Museum
     of the Arts with support from The Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts, The Paul G. Allen
     Family Foundation, Leslie-Lohman Museum of Gay and Lesbian Art, and Gilead Sciences, Inc. The
     exhibit will run until January 10, 2016.</content>

    <content>Olympia, (Wash), A chapter of the Cold War touched Thurston County in the early 1980s,
     when the nuclear arms race was in full swing and peace advocates across the country suggested
     The United States and The USSR could stop building nuclear arms. Thurston County advocates
     convened their own active and successful Nuclear Freeze group, which influenced policy from
     1980 to 1985.<br/> &amp;#160;<br/> On Thursday, November 5, at 3:30pm, The Evergreen State
     College Daniel J. Evans Library will host several of the original Thurston County Nuclear

     Facilitators include retired Evergreen faculty, Thad Curtz and Helena Meyer Knapp, who were
     part of the movement.<br/> &amp;#160;<br/> According to Evergreen&amp;#8217;s Library Dean,
     Greg Mullins, the discussion is an important piece of history that should not be forgotten.
     &amp;#8220;Many of our students are concerned with climate change today, and many feel there is
     little they can do at the local level. But right here in Thurston County we have evidence that
     ordinary citizens can effect historic change. To hear their story, and how they helped changed
     how the White House thought about nuclear weapons, is significant."<br/> &amp;#160;<br/> Local

     attempt to transcend, transform or re-imagine inherited histories; they sample, re-mix, and
     re-purpose to disrupt, re-write or map alternative trajectories for those histories, art forms,
     and social relationships.&amp;#160; We might seek answers in the exhibited works, which abide
     in the questions, and hold open space and time for us to imagine our own possible futures.<br/>
     &amp;#160;<br/> Artists include Damali Abrams, Lisa Blas, Christopher Buening, Amjad Faur,
     Dakota Gearhart, Liselot van der Heijden, C. Davida Ingram, Steffani Jemison, Joan Livingstone,

     <p>Olympia, (Wash) -When the World Meeting on Families, the world&amp;#8217;s largest event for
      Catholic families at 18,000 registrants, opens September 25, with Pope Francis in attendance,
      one of the breakout session panelists will be esteemed marriage historian and Evergreen
      faculty member Stephanie Coontz.</p>
     <p>Coontz is a nationally recognized expert on contemporary families, whose work was recently
      cited in the Supreme Court of the United States&amp;#8217; landmark decision on same-sex
      marriage.</p>
     <p>&amp;#8220;The Catholic Church, at this point in its history, really elevates the family as
      a central part of people&amp;#8217;s commitments and morality &amp;#8211; and I think I was
      asked to be on this panel just to remind people that the traditional two-parent nuclear family
      was not always idyllic,&amp;#8221; said Coontz. &amp;#8220;I&amp;#8217;ve been asked to
      explain how we should not romanticize the family of the past. As the Catholic Church and its
      believers go on to improve their marriages in the present, they should not delude themselves
      that people of the past did marriage much better.&amp;#8221;</p>
     <p>Coontz went on to say that present-day marriages are, ideally, unions based on love and
      mutual respect, where a past history of marriage shows they were made for considerations of
      status and the subordination of women.</p>
     <p>Coontz is unlikely to meet Pope Francis in Philadelphia, but she says, &amp;#8220;I very
      much welcome this pope&amp;#8217;s openness and his emphasis on policies that speak to the
      needs of the more disadvantaged members of society.&amp;#8221; She hopes she can reach people
      with her message, and that she can, &amp;#8220;help them without in any way asking them to
      change their world views? How can I help them expand their world views to help all of us,
      Catholic and non-Catholic alike?&amp;#8221;</p>
     <p>Pope Francis' six-day, three-city tour of the U.S. was originally centered around this
      event, which had been scheduled in 2006. Pope Francis had promised to be at the closing
      concert, the Festival of Families on Saturday, September 26, which is expected to draw 500,000
      participants, and to celebrate Mass on Sunday, September 27, with one million attendees. The
      conference is billed as a blend of prayer, religious instruction and faith-themed
      lectures.</p>

    <content>Tacoma, (Wash) - When Chinese President, Xi Jinping stops in the Pacific Northwest on
     his way to Washington D.C., he will visit the Tacoma classroom of Nathan Gibbs-Bowling,
     &amp;#8217;04, and a 2006 graduate of the Evergreen Masters in Teaching program. President Xi
     is scheduled to visit Gibbs-Bowling&amp;#8217;s class on September 23.<br/> &amp;#160;<br/>
     Gibbs-Bowling teaches AP Government at Lincoln High School, in the neighborhood where he grew
     up. His students are currently making a comparative study of the American and Chinese
     presidencies and Gibbs-Bowling cannot imagine more perfect timing, or a more perfect guest.
     &amp;#8220;What better speaker to come in and chime in on the conversation,&amp;#8221; he told
     King 5 News.<br/> &amp;#160;<br/> This has already been an important week for Gibbs-Bowling, as
     he was named Washington&amp;#8217;s 2016 Teacher of the Year at an awards ceremony at the
     Experience Music Project in Seattle on September 21.<br/> &amp;#160;<br/> State Superintendent
     of Schools, Randy Dorn praised the regional winners and Gibbs-Bowling, the state winner, by
     saying, &amp;#8220;Nathan and the 2016 Teachers of the Year are great examples of the deep
     caring educators have for their students and communities. This is not just a job for them. It
     is a calling. They put everything they have into helping their students learn because they know
     student success affects the whole community.&amp;#8221; Dorn continued, &amp;#8220;They all
     have great big hearts, and although they are definitely experts in their subjects, they also
     realize at the end of the day, they don&amp;#8217;t teach math or English or social studies.
     They teach kids.&amp;#8221;<br/> &amp;#160;<br/> Also a 2014 recipient of the prestigious
     national $25,000 Milken Educator Award, Gibbs-Bowling has written on education issues for The
     Seattle Times, is an AVID (Advancement Via Individual Determination) certified teacher and is a
     founding member of his school&amp;#8217;s Professional Leadership Development team.<br/>
     &amp;#160;<br/> He says the Chinese president&amp;#8217;s September 23 visit to his classroom
     is, &amp;#8220;Kind of amazing to me.&amp;#8221; As he told King 5, &amp;#8220;This is the
     second most powerful person in the world and he is coming to see the work that I
     do.&amp;#8221;</content>

     <p class="intro">Sixth among Public Regional Universities in the West; First for Innovation;
      Second for Undergraduate Teaching</p>
     <p>(Olympia, Wash.) The 2016 U.S. News &amp; World Report college rankings are out today and
      The Evergreen State College continued to make a strong showing. Evergreen ranked sixth among
      public regional universities in the West. Among all regional universities in the West, public
      or private, Evergreen ranked first for most innovative colleges, second for best undergraduate
      teaching and 29th in the best for veterans category.<br/> &amp;#160;<br/> Evergreen was also
      one of 26 colleges and universities in the nation praised for providing outstanding first-year
      experiences for freshmen and one of 19 noted for creating strong learning communities that
      help students get to know one another and their faculty well, building solid foundations for
      learning.<br/> &amp;#160;<br/> The rankings are based on graduation and retention rates, peer
      assessment, faculty resources, student selectivity, financial resources, graduation rate
      performance and alumni giving.<br/> &amp;#160;<br/> &amp;#8220;Along with
      Evergreen&amp;#8217;s recognition as one of the nation&amp;#8217;s best colleges by Fiske
      Guide, Princeton Review, Washington Monthly and others, the U.S. News &amp; World Report
      rankings add another important lens for prospective students and their parents,&amp;#8221;
      explained Evergreen spokesman Todd Sprague. &amp;#8220;While a personal visit to campus
      remains the best way to find a good fit, these rankings can help highlight schools, like
      Evergreen, that should be on the radar in a student&amp;#8217;s college
      search.&amp;#8221;<br/> &amp;#160;<br/> The Evergreen State College is a public four-year
      college nationally recognized for its distinctive interdisciplinary approach to the liberal
      arts, strong academics and focus on undergraduate teaching. The college also has an upper
      division bachelor&amp;#8217;s degree program and facility in Tacoma&amp;#8217;s Hilltop
      neighborhood, annual upper-division offerings at Grays Harbor College and a Reservation-Based
      Community Determined program at tribal reservations in western Washington. In addition to
      undergraduate education, Evergreen offers three graduate degrees: Master in Teaching, Master
      of Environmental Studies and Master of Public Administration, including a distinctive tribal
      governance concentration. www.evergreen.edu</p>

    <content>Olympia, (Wash.), This Saturday, September 19 The Evergreen State College will come
     alive with the bustle of students moving in, attending orientation activities, buying books and
     preparing to start the school year. But for 50 civic-minded first-year students, college
     started September 13 with an extracurricular program designed to put them on a leadership
     track.Called Evergreen Student Civic Engagement Institute (ESCEI), the early start involves
     five days of workshops, reading and writing, volunteering and community outreach. The question
     to be posed to the students, according to institute director John McLain, is &amp;#8220;How do
     we, as participants in a democratic society, work together with people whose views are
     different from our own?&amp;#8221; <p>A highlight of the week involves a day in downtown
      Olympia and at the Capitol this morning (September 15). The group will start out at the
      isthmus, discussing the future of Capitol Lake with two distinct nonprofit organizations, the
      Capitol Lake Improvement and Protection Association and the Deschutes Estuary Restoration
      Team.</p>
     <p>In the afternoon, the students will meet in a Senate hearing room for a moderated
      conversation with two millennial legislators from two parties, Rep. Joe Fitzgibbon, D, LD-34,
      Burien and Rep. Melanie Stambaugh, R, LD-25, Puyallup. Later that afternoon journalist Austin
      Jenkins of Northwest Public Radio and TVW will give a talk entitled &amp;#8220;Smash Mouth;
      Making Headlines or Making Change?&amp;#8221;</p>
     <p>During this first week on campus, the ESCEI students will also do volunteer work for Books
      to Prisoners and GRuB, learn conflict resolutions skills from the Dispute Resolution Center of
      Thurston County, and meet with Evergreen&amp;#8217;s incoming president, George Bridges as
      well as former Washington Governor and Evergreen President, Dan Evans, and the college
      foundation&amp;#8217;s Board of Governors. Said McLain, &amp;#8220;The idea is to bring the
      students to campus and help them jumpstart their careers as student leaders and team builders,
      to give them tools to contribute to a society with big, complicated problems.&amp;#8221;
      McLain wants students to explore and cultivate humility, empathy, persistence, hope, patience,
      self-reflection, and a commitment to embracing complexity, or, as he puts it, &amp;#8220;the
      habits of civility and democratic engagement.&amp;#8221;</p>
     <p>Inspired by Evergreen Trustee and donor Fred Goldberg, who felt strongly that civic
      engagement and civil dialogue should be integral aspects of a college education, ESCEI was
      launched thanks to Goldberg&amp;#8217;s generosity in 2013. The institute gives students
      alternate paradigms to the often-polarized and frustrating levels of American
      discourse.&amp;#8220;</p>
     <p>At ESCEI students hear various, even opposing views from leaders and organizations that then
      move forward to work together successfully,&amp;#8221; said Evergreen Academic Vice President
      and Provost, Michael Zimmerman. &amp;#8220;To be able to observe and then model this is so
      important in our times.&amp;#8221; Said Goldberg, &amp;#8220;Civic engagement and
      conversations about difficult issues are core values at Evergreen. I wanted to help new
      students get involved in ways that allow them to see challenging topics from multiple
      perspectives. The first-year students who have participated in ESCEI have gone on to be campus
      leaders and will be leaders in their communities too.&amp;#8221;</p>
     <p>Incoming first year students apply for the 50 slots and pay $475 for the institute, though
      scholarships are available up to the full amount.</p></content>

    <content>Olympia, (Wash.), Every September for the last 26 years, The Evergreen State College
     has sent 50-150 incoming first-year students to various Thurston County nonprprofits for a day
     of volunteer service.&amp;#160; This year, on Friday, September 25, the tradition
     continues.<br/> &amp;#160;<br/> The last six years have seen a flourishing partnership between
     the college&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8220;Community to Community&amp;#8221; day and The United
     Way&amp;#8217;s 23-year old &amp;#8220;Day of Caring,&amp;#8221; in which the local chapter of
     the national organization sends more than 700 volunteers to over 40 nonprofits on the same
     day.<br/> &amp;#160;<br/> The Evergreen crew will join United Way volunteers at several sites,
     among them Family Support Center, Thurston County Food Bank, Nisqually Land Trust and more.
     Community to Community is run by Evergreen&amp;#8217;s Center for Community Based Learning
     (CCBLA), whose mission is to promote student learning in the community by connecting academic
     programs, students and faculty with community organizations. According to CCBLA Director, Ellen
     Shortt-Sanchez, Evergreen will partner with nonprofits inside and outside the United Way scope
     on September 25, including Books to Prisoners, Cielo Project, Interfaith Works and Tumwater
     Stream Team. The United Way lists education, health and economic self-sufficiency as its goals;
     Evergreen adds environmental and social justice. <br/> &amp;#160;<br/> The incoming freshmen
     move into their dorms and off-campus apartments a week before classes start, to attend
     orientation activities. Community to Community is an optional orientation activity, said
     Shortt-Sanchez. &amp;#8220;For students, it is part of them getting to know this new community;
     this way, they are giving back right from the start.&amp;#8221; She notes that the activity is
     a way for new students to get acquainted and socialize.&amp;#160; They also meet students from
     St. Martins University, who participate in Day of Caring.<br/> &amp;#160;<br/> The partnering
     nonprofit organizations don&amp;#8217;t just put students to work, said Shortt-Sanchez.
     &amp;#8220;The students have a chance to hear about the organization &amp;#8211; what it does,
     what it&amp;#8217;s about,&amp;#8221; she said. &amp;#8220;And some students go back to those
     organizations, to volunteer or do an internship later on.&amp;#8221;<br/> &amp;#160;<br/>
     Evergreen espouses a culture of service and civic engagement; more than 70% of students and
     graduates surveyed in a recent economic impact study say they have volunteered in the Olympia
     area, and students did more than 300 internships in Thurston County during the 2014-15 academic
     year.</content>

      Master&amp;#8217;s Institutions and Best Bang for the Buck &amp;#8211; Other Washington
      Colleges and Universities Earn High Rankings As Well</p>
     <p>WASHINGTON, D.C., August 24, 2015</p>
     <p>Washington Monthly magazine today released its 2015 College Guide, ranking the nation's
      colleges and universities based on three criteria: social mobility, research and civic
      engagement.</p>
     <p>The Evergreen State College ranked number 31 in the nation among 673 master&amp;#8217;s
      universities. Other Washington institutions in the top 100 master&amp;#8217;s universities
      included Whitworth University (12), Pacific Lutheran University (25), Seattle University (26),
      Western Washington University (27), and Gonzaga University (30).</p>
     <p>Washington Monthly also rates colleges that are doing the best job of helping non-wealthy
      students attain marketable degrees at affordable prices. The Evergreen State College is among
      these &amp;#8220;Best Bang for the Buck&amp;#8221; institutions as well.</p>
     <p>The top 100 Best Bang for the Buck institutions in the West (out of 233 listed) include
      University of Washington (Seattle &amp;#8211; 1, Bothell &amp;#8211; 13, Tacoma &amp;#8211;
      22), The Evergreen State College (29), Western Washington University (30), Eastern Washington
      University (37), Central Washington University (44), Trinity Lutheran College (47), Whitworth
      University (52), Seattle Pacific University (53), Washington State University (68), Gonzaga
      University (76), Seattle University (79), and University of Puget Sound (81). The complete
      college rankings are available at <a href="http://bit.ly/collegeguide2015" target="blank"
       >http://bit.ly/collegeguide2015</a>.</p>
     <p>&amp;#8220;While no single ranking provides a complete picture of a college or
      university,&amp;#8221; explained Evergreen spokesman Todd Sprague, &amp;#8220;the Washington
      Monthly approach emphasizes some important considerations, including affordability, value,
      access and civic engagement. Those align well with Evergreen&amp;#8217;s mission as a public
      institution.&amp;#8221; Founded in 1969, Washington Monthly is a bimonthly nonprofit magazine
      covering politics, government, culture and the media.</p>
     <p>The Evergreen State College is a public four-year college nationally recognized for its
      distinctive interdisciplinary approach to the liberal arts, strong academics and focus on
      undergraduate teaching. The college also has an upper division bachelor&amp;#8217;s degree
      program in Tacoma&amp;#8217;s Hilltop neighborhood. In addition to undergraduate education,
      Evergreen offers three graduate degrees: Master in Teaching, Master of Environmental Studies
      and Master of Public Administration, including a distinctive tribal governance
      concentration.</p>

    <content>Olympia, (Wash.), Nearly all the students who graduated Evergreen&amp;#8217;s Master in
     Teaching (MiT) program last June are enjoying the last weeks of Summer, as they will not be
     unemployed for long. <br/>
     <br/> By mid-August, 30 out of the 31 MiT Class of 2015 graduates have accepted teaching
     positions across Western Washington and Oregon, and even abroad. While most of the new teachers
     stayed in the region &amp;#8211; Olympia, Tacoma, North Thurston, Puyallup, Hoquiam, Hood Canal
     and Shelton School Districts, others ventured to Beaverton, Portland and Sweet Home, Oregon, to
     Neah Bay and to Nablus, Palestine. <br/>
     <br/> They will teach subjects as diverse as visual arts, math, Spanish and Robotics, at levels
     everywhere between second grade and high school. <br/>
     <br/> According to MiT&amp;#8217;s associate director, Maggie Foran, the program&amp;#8217;s
     placement rates have been historically strong, but for a dip during and immediately after the
     Recession. &amp;#8220;The number of retirements went down, class sizes grew and first year
     teachers were being laid off,&amp;#8221; said Foran. In 2012 placements increased as schools
     began replenishing their teaching pools and reducing class sizes. <br/>
     <br/> The Evergreen program requires two student teaching internships &amp;#8211; in fall and
     spring of year two, where most programs require only one. Foran pointed out that,
     &amp;#8220;fall student teachers participate in the opening of a school year, as communities,
     rules and expectations are established.&amp;#8221; She noted, &amp;#8220;Research shows that
     teachers who did fall internships tend to do better their first year. <br/>
     <br/> The program sometimes attracts returning students who have significant achievements in
     other fields. Heather Claiborne (nee Littke), &amp;#8217;15, of the Snoqualmie area, had spent
     five years in geological mapping for the Washington Department of Natural Resources, Geology
     Division. Beginning September 9, she will teach seventh and eighth grade Life/Physical Science
     and Robotics at Nisqually Middle School, where she did an internship. &amp;#8220;I learned so
     much from the Evergreen program,&amp;#8221; said Claiborne. &amp;#8220;I was working with rocks
     and rocks don&amp;#8217;t talk back. <br/>
     <br/> Joking aside, Claiborne said she was, &amp;#8220;a blank slate,&amp;#8221; when she
     started her masters, and, ironically, she said, &amp;#8220;I feel more humble now. As a teacher
     there&amp;#8217;s so much to learn every day. <br/>
     <br/> She is thrilled to be teaching science to middle schoolers. &amp;#8220;Kids are so
     interested in the natural world,&amp;#8221; she said. She feels that the Evergreen program
     prepared her to take her own classroom next month, &amp;#8220;and that&amp;#8217;s an awesome
     feeling. <br/>
     <br/> Katie Schuessler, &amp;#8216;15 had previously taught art in Palestinian refugee camps
     and wanted to go back. She returns to the city of Nablus this month, where she will teach art
     to grades three to 11 at the nonprofit Pioneers Baccalaureate School. <br/>
     <br/> Even in a country where people struggle to meet basic needs, Schuessler believes art
     plays a critical role. &amp;#8220;The arts promote problem solving,&amp;#8221; she said.
     &amp;#8220;They offer valuable skills that are often overlooked. And they give students an
     opportunity to learn in a different way, away from language and words. <br/>
     <br/> Schuessler, who speaks some Arabic, will teach in an English immersion program.
     &amp;#8220;I&amp;#8217;ll be assessing my students&amp;#8217; language abilities and teaching a
     bit of English and art vocabulary,&amp;#8221; she said. <br/>
     <br/> At Evergreen she learned a great deal about English Language Learners as well as cultural
     competency and sensitivity, efficient classroom management and student empowerment.
     &amp;#8220;I don&amp;#8217;t have a hero complex,&amp;#8221; she said. &amp;#8220;If students
     can come into my classroom and feel safe expressing themselves in healthy ways, I will feel
     like I&amp;#8217;ve accomplished something. <br/>
     <br/> Schuessler, of Seattle, originally had to mitigate her parents&amp;#8217; concern about
     political instability in Palestine, but reported that they are planning to tour Palestine and
     Israel while she is there. &amp;#8220;They support my decision,&amp;#8221; she said.</content>

     <p>Olympia (Wash.) The Princeton Review has named The Evergreen State College one of The Best
      380 Colleges of 2016.</p>
     <p>Seven Washington colleges and universities have been included in the guide. In addition to
      Evergreen, Gonzaga University, Seattle University, University of Puget Sound, University of
      Washington, Washington State University and Whitman College made the list.<br/> As part of the
      guide, The Princeton Review puts forth 62 ranking lists that provide students with details
      about campus and academic culture, size, type and quality of residence halls, dining and more.
      These sub-lists give college applicants, "a way to see the types of colleges that could help
      them achieve their future goals and dreams," said Robert Franek, Princeton Review's Senior
      VP-Publisher. "Our goal is to help applicants choose and get into their dream college-the
      college best for them."<br/> "We believe all 380 schools in the book are academically
      outstanding," the guide's editors note. "But we don't think academics should be the exclusive
      reason for choosing a school-and in most cases, it isn't. Among other crucial factors (such as
      location, cost and size), the campus culture is very important. The schools featured in The
      380 Best Colleges-our picks of the cream of the crop colleges and universities-comprise only
      the top 15 percent of all four-year colleges in the nation. These are all very different
      schools with different and wonderful things to offer."<br/> According to the guide's "Inside
      Word" on Evergreen, "Students... are commonly some of the strongest performers from their high
      schools...The school's unique and self-directed academic curriculum favors those students who
      can adequately handle the responsibility of creating and developing their own educational path."<br/>
      <br/> The review notes that students describe Evergreen as welcoming, with a "booming
      extracurricular life" and a "thriving local art and music scene."<br/>
      <br/> Students also gave high marks to their faculty. "My professors have been A++, if
      Evergreen gave grades," one student was quoted as saying, in a reference to Evergreen's unique
      narrative evaluation process in lieu of letter grades.<br/>
      <br/> "While no single college guide or ranking tells the whole story about a school," said
      Evergreen spokesman Todd Sprague, "we're pleased that The Princeton Review has once again
      cited Evergreen as one of the best colleges in the nation."</p>
     <p>The Evergreen State College in Olympia is a public, four-year, liberal arts college
      nationally recognized for its distinctive interdisciplinary approach, strong academics and
      focus on undergraduate teaching. The college also has an upper division bachelor's degree
      program in Tacoma's Hilltop neighborhood. In addition to undergraduate education, Evergreen
      offers three graduate degrees: Master in Teaching, Master of Environmental Studies and Master
      of Public Administration (including a distinctive tribal governance concentration).</p>

     <p>Two staff members associated with the Longhouse Education and Cultural Center at The
      Evergreen State College have won awards in the Tenth Annual In The Spirit: Contemporary Native
      Arts Market and Festival, a regional juried show celebrating Native American arts and artists.<br/>
      <br/> The festival, which will be held August 8 at the Washington State History Museum in
      Tacoma, features pieces by Linley Logan, director of Evergreen's Northwest Heritage program
      and Erin Genia, the Longhouse's program coordinator and a two-time Evergreen graduate. Linley
      won the Innovation award, for his vessel entitled MANInfestation, and Genia won Best of Show,
      also for a vessel, entitled Open Pit Gold Mine Vessel. Linley is Seneca and Genia is
      Sisseton-Wahpeton Oyate.<br/>
      <br/> Logan's piece, a 24 inch high and 22 inch wide vessel shaped at once like a mutated fish
      and a bomb, is made from cardboard, plaster of paris, gauze, bullet shells and paper pulp, and
      took four years to complete, in part because desired thickness and hollow walls posed a
      challenge. (Linley applied his Industrial Design background to achieve his goal.) Miniature
      replicas of Edvard Munch's The Scream adorn the four corners of the piece. "The Scream itself
      was based on a Peruvian mummy that Munch had seen," said Logan. "So, I am culturally
      re-appropriating it back to its indigenous roots." The piece is painted gold, to represent
      idol worship, and its themes cover war, climate change and industrialization.<br/>
      <br/> Genia had traveled extensively and was on her way to a gathering of indigenous artists
      in New Zealand when she saw pit mines in the landscape below the plane. "I wanted to reflect
      the similarities between the indigenous experiences of the Pacific Northwest and New Zealand.
      The extraction of resources is something we're dealing with across the globe," she said.<br/>
      <br/> She created the vessel at the gathering through a Raku firing technique for pottery, but
      it broke in her suitcase on the way home. Undeterred, she put the piece back together using a
      Japanese technique known as Kintsugi, in which gold is painted along the crack lines. "The
      philosophy is that it's more beautiful after being broken," said Genia, "but it also reminds
      us that gold extraction is very harmful to the planet."<br/>
      <br/> The In The Spirit Festival, August 8, involves a day of dancing, drumming, singing, and
      shopping with a diverse group of Native American artists. The museum plaza will be filled with
      vendors selling artwork in all price ranges and all exhibits are free to the public that day.
      The In the Spirit Exhibit runs until August 30.<br/>
      <br/> The Evergreen Longhouse, which celebrates its 20th anniversary this year, is the first
      of its kind on an American college campus and is known locally, regionally, nationally and
      throughout the Pacific Rim, as an educational and artistic hub for Native American culture and
      voices.</p>

    <content>The eruption of Mt. St. Helens passed its 35th anniversary last spring, but to many of
     the retirement-aged botanists, geologists, foresters and researchers tracking blast recovery
     since the early 1980s, this summer represents the passing of the torch to younger scientists
     eager to continue observing and collecting data on the mountain and surrounding terrain. <br/>
     <br/> One of the research teams that will pick up the mantle is a trio of faculty from The
     Evergreen State College. Abir Biswas, Ph.D., Dylan Fischer, Ph.D. and Carri LeRoy, Ph.D., along
     with their students, will be spending the last week of July at Mt. St. Helens as part of The
     Pulse, a meeting of more than 100 scientists sponsored by the US Forest Service. The group
     meets at Mt. St. Helens every five years to measure and report on the area&amp;#8217;s
     recovery. <br/>
     <br/> Fischer and Biswas have taken over the measuring of forests and soil in the Tephra Fall
     Zone from a team based at Oregon State University. Located outside the Blowdown Zone, the
     Tephra Fall Zone consists of old growth forest and clear cuts that were covered with two to 15
     millimeters of ash and small pumice rock during the blast. <br/>
     <br/> LeRoy will work separately with US Forest Service scientist Shannon Claeson, student
     research fellow Emily Wolfe and recent Evergreen graduate Andy Berger. Their team will monitor
     the development of five streams that formed directly after the eruption, but whose recovery
     paths have diverged. <br/>
     <br/> The three faculty members, along with three Evergreen summer undergraduate research
     fellows and a recent Evergreen graduate. Student researchers Andrew Buechel, Abby Watt, Wolfe
     and Berger will join The Pulse July 26-31 at Mt. St. Helens. They will start the week on July
     26 with a dinner and campfire, as all the researchers share a campground. The researchers will
     tour each other&amp;#8217;s sites the next day, and then they will concentrate on their own or
     team&amp;#8217;s work. <br/>
     <br/> According to Fischer, the old growth forests surrounding the mountain turned into
     &amp;#8220;concrete forests&amp;#8221; after the blast. &amp;#8220;You could drive a car on the
     ash,&amp;#8221; he said. But the forests are coming back with a new understory of huckleberries
     and other low-growing plants. <br/>
     <br/> The adjacent clear cuts and replanted forests have not fared so well, he noted. With no
     shelter, seeds blow away, wind scours the ground, soil doesn&amp;#8217;t develop and plants
     don&amp;#8217;t recover. Big, old trees drop needles and cones and provide habitat for animals,
     which adds nutrients that develop soil. &amp;#8220;The St. Helens ash was very nutrient-poor.
     The ash layer created a blank slate for new soil,&amp;#8221; said Fischer. <br/>
     <br/> The streams that LeRoy and her collaborators will observe, &amp;#8220;were created all at
     the same time, just 35 years ago,&amp;#8221; according to Fischer, &amp;#8220;but may all be
     very different in terms of what fish live in them, what insects are there, what plants are
     growing on their banks.&amp;#8221; He attributes the divergence to variations in stream
     temperature, shrub cover and, potentially, stream chemistry. &amp;#8220;Although there have
     been studies of fish in these streams and nearby Spirit Lake, no one has looked at stream
     development after the eruption,&amp;#8221; he said. &amp;#8220;We think after 35 years maybe
     we&amp;#8217;ve done it all, but researchers are still barely scratching the surface. <br/>
     <br/> Fischer says Evergreen is a natural match for the project. Not only is it the closest
     institution to the site, Evergreen has programs that train students in soil sampling, botany,
     environmental science (including water issues), geology and forestry. &amp;#8220;What is
     inspiring and exciting to me is that this is a hopeful kind of research. Even a massive
     eruption like Mt. St. Helens isn&amp;#8217;t the end of things. It&amp;#8217;s the beginning of
     something new.</content>

    <content>Olympia, (Wash) On July 17, the U.S. Department of Education announced a grant package
     of $270million for 968 college student support services program projects. Among the colleges
     and universities awarded was The Evergreen State College, which received a $1.5million,
     five-year grant for a new Student Success program that connects low income, first generation
     and disabled students with proactive advising, peer mentoring, and academic course work that
     will help them to thrive in college. <br/>
     <br/> The $1.5million, or approximately $300,000 a year, will serve 180 students as they
     transition to and within Evergreen. The federal funding will replace a former Department of
     Education grant called Key Student Services, which expires on August 31st. <br/>
     <br/> Evergreen is the only institution in Thurston or Mason County to be awarded a part of
     this grant. <br/>
     <br/> According to Felix Braffith, the director of TRiO's Student Success and College Access
     programs at Evergreen, the new name of the grant will "reframe the conversation, from support
     services to success, so as not to stigmatize an already marginalized population. It is an
     opportunity for members of our campus community to view TRiO eligible students from an asset or
     strengths-based mindset instead of the often-discussed deficit model." <br/>
     <br/> Far from being a rebranding strategy, the program will formally add a series of high
     impact, two-credit courses aimed to increase the number of students that successfully
     transition into the institution. Those students will receive a high level of financial literacy
     training, guidance on connecting academic pathways to career passions, and exposure to the
     process of applying to graduate school. "From there, individual advising will build off the
     courses," said Braffith, who described the new program as, "a robust and comprehensive level of
     guidance." <br/>
     <br/> Students apply to the program by referral, from a high school counselor, a community
     college advisor or staff on campus. Evergreen has received funding for similar types of
     programming since 1979. Braffith expects a wait list, as Evergreen's student body of over 4,000
     includes 51% low income and 9% disabled students. But Braffith is confident that this grant
     will help many. "It is a slice of what's needed."</content>

    <content>Olympia, (Wash) Criminal defense attorney Scott Kauffman of San Francisco wanted to
     give back to his alma mater, The Evergreen State College. &amp;#8220;My experience at Evergreen
     was probably the most liberating experience of my life, which I have learned to appreciate more
     as I've grown older,&amp;#8221; he said. &amp;#8220;Evergreen exposed me to the
     interconnectedness of academic disciplines that gave me a vital foundation for life-long
     learning. Most importantly, my Evergreen education gave me the courage to follow my own
     professional path and not worry about how "traditional" lawyers pursued their
     careers.&amp;#8221; This reflection led Kauffman to put his hat in the ring to become a
     governor of The Evergreen State College Foundation, along with two other new governors,
     Christina Meserve of Olympia and Dean Katz of Seattle. <br/>
     <br/> Katz and Meserve both graduated Evergreen in 1975, Meserve having entered the college in
     1971, the year that it opened. Kauffman graduated in 1980. Meserve and Kauffman are both
     attorneys and Katz is senior communications officer and writer for the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates
     Foundation; he hopes to bring his expansive journalism and public relations experience to his
     service on the Board of Governors. <br/>
     <br/> Meserve, who has served on the foundation board twice, as well as on college&amp;#8217;s
     Board of Trustees, said she was, &amp;#8220;persuaded that some institutional memory on the
     Board may be appropriate at this time. <br/>
     <br/> At this time Evergreen is undergoing a presidential transition as current President, Les
     Purce prepares to retire September 30 and George Bridges prepares to assume the office October
     1. One of Meserve&amp;#8217;s goals as a governor, she said, is to &amp;#8220;help the
     transition to a new era for Evergreen. <br/>
     <br/> Katz said he had been looking at ways to help Evergreen for some time and was happy for
     this opportunity. He left high school in 1969 and, in 1971 his father suggested he visit the
     new college opening in Olympia. He calls his campus visit and subsequent application
     &amp;#8220;the best decision of my life. <br/>
     <br/> Evergreen provided me with the tools to navigate the world; it enabled me to build a
     sense of self and of competency,&amp;#8221; said Katz. <br/>
     <br/> Board Chair Keri Carkeek is thrilled to have the new governors on board. &amp;#8220;It is
     exciting to see the strength of the governors on the Foundation Board continue with these three
     individuals,&amp;#8221; said Carkeek. &amp;#8220;Their varied backgrounds and experience will
     be a great addition to the existing depth of individuals we are so fortunate to
     have."</content>

    <content>Greece, Turkey, France and Spain are all known for their archaeological treasures. <br/>
     <br/> But, Tumwater? <br/>
     <br/> This July and August Evergreen faculty member and Stanford-educated archaeologist Ulrike
     Krotscheck, Ph.D., will coach 16 Evergreen students on a dig in Tumwater that could shed new
     light on Washington and Thurston County history. <br/>
     <br/> Between July 29 and August 27, the students will have the first opportunity to study the
     George Washington Bush farm since 2009; during that month they will search for artifacts
     belonging to or providing information about this original Pioneer family. <br/>
     <br/> George Bush, a free man of African and Irish heritage, along with his German-American
     wife Isabella and their children, led a wagon train west from Missouri with the hopes of
     settling in Oregon Territory. Driven North by the Oregon "Lash Laws," the Bush family became
     one of the first families to settle in the Tumwater area in 1845. They staked a land claim at
     the South end of the Puget Sound, where they soon became a welcoming stop for settlers en-route
     to Seattle and Tacoma. By 1850, they had developed their thriving farm in Tumwater and were
     known as one of the most generous families in the region. But men of color could not legally
     own land, so the Washington Territorial Legislature, on March 17th, 1854, requested that the
     United States Congress grant George and Isabella the land they had successfully settled and
     farmed. The resolution passed, setting a state and national precedent. <br/>
     <br/> The Bush Homestead is now a Community Supported Agriculture (CSA) farm owned by Kathleen
     and Mark Clark. The Clarks were instrumental in the creation of the field school, with the aim
     of increasing the history's visibility; they had set up an informational website, but wanted a
     more thorough and scientific investigation, which led them to partner with Krotscheck and
     Evergreen. "They want the artifacts displayed," said Krotscheck, who is also partnering with
     the Northwest African American Museum, Thurston County Historic Commission, Tumwater Historic
     Preservation Commission, the Squaxin and Nisqually Tribes and Olympia School District to
     disseminate new findings about the Bushes. <br/>
     <br/> The excavation will likely unearth small household objects that will provide clues to the
     Bushes daily life and activities. "We can learn a lot about their lives from their dishes and
     glassware; what they were eating, what their trading connections were, etc." She added that the
     work won't be glamorous. "Mostly we will be dealing with trash - the things that were broken or
     thrown away." In fact, Krotscheck said, "Most findings at archaeological sites from all over
     the world are things that were left behind or thrown away." While such finds may appear less
     valuable than pieces in museum displays, the context of the artifacts is what gives them their
     significance, Krotscheck explained. <br/>
     <br/> The students' first task will be site clearing; they will then spend two days a week in
     the field and two days a week analyzing finds in the lab. At the program's end they will place
     geotextile cloth in the units they've dug, and backfill them to protect any lower strata and to
     delineate the limits of the 2015 field season. <br/>
     <br/> Krotscheck, who often spends summers with peers, digging in Europe, looks forward to the
     local project, to mentoring students, developing open forums for scholars and community
     members, and to hosting observers on public tours the afternoons of August 5, 6, 12, 13, 19 and
     20. "People think archaeologists dig to uncover the past," she said, "but I think a more
     important goal is to learn from it." <br/>

     <p>In the coming week, The Evergreen State College will host a group of 200 university faculty,
      staff and administrators from 22 colleges nationwide for the 17th National Summer Institute on
      Learning Communities.</p>
     <p>A function of the Washington Center, a public service center at Evergreen and the national
      resource center for learning communities, the Summer Institute offers comprehensive training
      for community colleges, colleges and universities looking to start learning communities or
      enhance existing learning community programs.</p>
     <p>Similar to and inspired by the interdisciplinary teaching model established at Evergreen,
      learning communities often link two seemingly disparate courses to create relevance,
      timeliness and systems thinking.</p>
     <p>A variation, living learning communities, connect a course and a residence hall, allowing
      students in a particular course to live, study and socialize together.</p>
     <p>Both types of learning communities have significant benefits, according to the American
      Association of Colleges and Universities, which lists learning communities as having a
      &amp;#8220;high impact&amp;#8221; benefit to college students from many backgrounds
      and&amp;#160; can increase retention and completion rates.</p>
     <p>Teams from the 22 two and four-year campuses will arrive July 13 and depart July 17. During
      the four days of the conference, they will take part in workshops and panel discussions, and
      will have time in their teams to prepare the action plan that will start or enhance their
      learning communities.</p>
     <p>According to Emily Lardner, Ph.D., director of the Washington Center, &amp;#8220;on some
      campuses,&amp;#160; learning communities are mostly about academics. Others pay more attention
      to social or cultural elements.&amp;#8221;</p>
     <p>One example of a more social learning community is that of Seattle University, which set up
      a program called &amp;#8220;Being Local.&amp;#8221; Aimed at their first and second-year
      commuter students, this learning community is tied into an all-campus lecture series and
      involves creating a physical space on campus where commuters can gather.&amp;#160; Said
      Lardner, &amp;#8220;Retention rates can go up if the learning community is done well.</p>
     <p>Research shows that learning communities lead to increased formal and informal time with
      faculty and fellow students and a strong connection with Student Affairs and Residence Life.
      It is a kind of &amp;#8220;one-stop shopping,&amp;#8221; in Lardner&amp;#8217;s view, which
      helps students who are struggling, in particular.</p>
     <p>The 22 schools are Blinn College; Briar Cliff University; California State University
      Channel Islands; Casper College; Cornell College; Eastfield College; Florida Atlantic
      University; Ivy Tech Community College; Long Island University, Post Campus; MiraCosta
      College; Mt. San Jacinto College; New Mexico Highlands University; Phoenix College; Prairie
      View A &amp; M; Saint Paul College; Santa Rosa Junior College; Seattle University; University
      of Mississippi; University of Puerto Rico &amp;#8211; Arecibo Campus; University of South
      Florida Saint Petersburg and Western Carolina University.</p>
     <p>The Washington Center at Evergreen is 30 years old this year and has hosted 17 Summer
      Institutes for those colleges and universities eager to start or improve learning communities.
      Lardner estimates that over 300 colleges have participated since the program&amp;#8217;s
      inception. Institute attendees will stay in the Evergreen dorms; they will have time to
      explore Olympia&amp;#8217;s many restaurants and shops as well.</p>

     <p>On Wednesday, July 8 founding President of The Evergreen State College Charles McCann passed
      away at his home in Olympia. He was 89 years old.</p>
     <p>McCann was appointed to the Evergreen presidency by the college's Board of Trustees in 1968
      after the Washington State Legislature passed a bill in 1967 authorizing the college. He
      served as Evergreen&amp;#8217;s president until 1977, when he stepped down to join the faculty
      and turn over the presidency to former Washington Governor, Daniel J. Evans. McCann continued
      to be involved with Evergreen after he retired from the faculty in 1991, teaching classes and
      establishing an endowed scholarship at the college, the <a
       href="http://www.evergreen.edu/scholarships/scholarships/mccann.htm">Barbara and Charles
       McCann Scholarship</a>.</p>
     <p>Prior to working at Evergreen, McCann earned a Ph.D. in English from Yale University. He
      first joined the faculty at Central Washington State College (now Central Washington
      University) in 1956, where he progressed from an associate professorship to Chairman of the
      Department of English. He became assistant to the president in 1965 and later, Dean of
      Faculty.</p>
     <p>Credited with leading the design of Evergreen&amp;#8217;s unique educational model, McCann
      also hired founding faculty, oversaw the campus&amp;#8217; construction, opened the campus and
      graduated the first class of 21 students. Under his watch, Evergreen achieved accreditation
      one year ahead of schedule.</p>
     <p>According to Evergreen&amp;#8217;s Board of Trustees&amp;#8217; Chair Fred Goldberg, who
      knew McCann from the time he took the lead to establish the college, &amp;#8220;he had a
      wonderful sense of humor and he never veered from his goal.&amp;#8221;</p>
     <p><br/> In 1996, McCann received an honorary Masters of Public Administration from Evergreen.
      In the faculty petition for the degree, S.R. (Rudy) Martin, Ph.D., described McCann as a
      visionary. &amp;#8220;He specifically articulated his vision of what the college would
      become&amp;#8230;&amp;#8221; Martin went on to write, &amp;#8220;During the McCann presidency,
      Evergreen became... a widely acknowledged leader in American innovative higher
      education.&amp;#8221;</p>
     <p>Tom Anderson, a graduate of Evergreen&amp;#8217;s very first class, who now sits on the
      college foundation&amp;#8217;s Board of Governors, remembers McCann&amp;#8217;s early years.
      &amp;#8220;We would have potlucks (in the dorms) and it was not uncommon for Charlie to drop
      by for dinner. He was one of the most accessible &amp;#8216;executives&amp;#8217; I ever met.
      To a 20 year old in 1971, he was talking my language.&amp;#8221;</p>
     <p>A private service is planned by his family.</p>

    <content>Olympia, (Wash), June marks the end of the school year and beginning of summer break
     for students of all ages, but many college students may change residences during that time,
     vacating dorms and apartments for family homes near and far. <br/>
     <br/> As they depart, the question of where to leave their "stuff" can plague students, parents
     and on-campus residence staff. Storage is not always feasible, or even practical for the odd
     lamp, end table, old TV, appliance or extra clothing and many student possessions end up in
     landfills. <br/>
     <br/> This year, in conjunction with Post Landfill Action Network (PLAN), Residential and
     Dining Services (RAD) at The Evergreen State College will host "The Gathering," which
     encourages students to drop off items that they are not taking home and can't store. Items will
     be collected from Friday, June 5, to Saturday, June 13 and will either be available for sale
     next term or donated to such nonprofits as Egyhop and Interfaith Works Overnight Shelter).
     Proceeds of sale items go directly to residence hall student programming at Evergreen. <br/>
     <br/> The national PLAN is composed of college students and recent graduates (no one on staff
     finished college before 2012), guided by a professional caliber Board of Directors. As the PLAN
     website states, "Waste on college campuses balloons at the end of each academic year. Thousands
     of reusable or recyclable items, including electronics containing carcinogens like lead and
     mercury, were sent to landfills." As one example, the University of New Hampshire generated 125
     tons of waste when students moved out in the spring, up from the typical 25 tons of trash in
     each of the other months. <br/>
     <br/> In 2011, a group of undergraduates at the University of New Hampshire noticed dumpsters
     overflowing with reusable materials after spring move-out. Then, in the fall, they watched as
     students moving back to campus bought many of the same items new at big box stores. To end the
     cycle of waste, the students created a program called Trash 2 Treasure, which eventually
     blossomed into the current national student-led PLAN movement. <br/>
     <br/> Evergreen is one of three colleges on the West Coast and the only one in Washington to
     participate in the event. The other two West Coast colleges are Pitzer and Marymount in
     California. <br/>
     <br/> According to RAD Director, Sharon Goodman, Evergreen was a perfect fit to test the
     program in the Northwest. "We have a long history of embracing sustainable practices at
     Evergreen," said Goodman. "Our students are on board with the idea and spearheading the
     project. It is the same message many of them are getting in their classes and programs on
     economics and the environment."</content>

     <p>Olympia, (Wash), June has arrived and, with it, wedding season. Sociologist <a
       href="http://www.bgsu.edu/arts-and-sciences/sociology/people/wendy-d-manning.html">Wendy
       Manning</a>, in a new paper prepared for the Council on Contemporary Families (CCF), <a
       href="https://contemporaryfamilies.org/remarriage-brief-report/">"Remarriage in the United
       States: If at first they don&amp;#8217;t succeed, do most Americans 'try, try again'?"</a>
      reports that in 2013, 40 percent of all marriages -- four out of every ten -- were remarriages
      for one of the partners. One in five were remarriages for both partners. Based on previous
      years, that could mean more than 40,000 remarriages just this month!<br/> &amp;#160;<br/> The
      CCF, whose Director of Research and Public Education is renowned Evergreen faculty member,
      Stephanie Coontz, seeks to further a national understanding of how America's families are
      changing and what is known about the strengths and weaknesses of different family forms and
      various family interventions.<br/>
      <br/> In her new paper Manning reviews key studies&amp;#8212;including her own at Bowling
      Green State University&amp;#8212;and reveals surprising trends, along with complicated pros
      and cons, for remarried couples and families:<br/> &amp;#160;<br/> "Divorced or widowed men
      and women are not giving up on intimate relationships: Among men and women in their early 40s,
      more than half of all marriages are remarriages&amp;#8212;and more than half of divorced and
      widowed people in this age group expect to marry again. Many do not wait for a license to
      repartner: Nearly half of all currently cohabiting adults were previously married.</p>
     <p>Yet rates of remarriage are down by 40 percent since 1990&amp;#8212;a trend that mirrors the
      decline in marriage overall. In addition, the length of time between divorce and a subsequent
      marriage has increased.</p>
     <p>Men are twice as likely to remarry as women: either because they have more enthusiasm for
      it&amp;#8212;or more ability to find someone who will marry them. In 1995, 54 percent of women
      who divorced before age 45 had remarried within five years of divorce. A decade later that had
      declined to 38 percent.</p>
     <p>Nearly 70 percent of remarried women under age 45 are part of a stepfamily, yet less than 10
      percent of these women are living with a stepchild. More often, it is the man who moves in
      with a new partner and her child or children. Almost half of remarried men in a stepfamily
      have a co-resident stepchild.</p>
     <p>The challenges of remarriage have changed as stepfamilies have become more common.</p>
     <ul>
      <li>&amp;#160;In 1980, the presence of stepchildren was associated with more marital conflict
       and lower satisfaction. But by 2000 that trend had reversed, so that remarriages with
       stepchildren had better marital quality (on average) than those without.</li>
      <li>Yet on average, remarriages are less stable than first marriages &amp;#8211; and they have
       become even more unstable over the past two decades. In 1995, less than a quarter of
       remarriages ended in divorce within 5 years. Today that is up to 31 percent."</li>
     </ul>
     <p>But averages do not tell the whole story. Some people are serial marriers and divorcers.
      Others learn from their first mistakes. In <a
       href="https://contemporaryfamilies.org/remarriage-brief-report/">&amp;#8220;Remarriages and
       Stepfamilies are Not Doomed to Fail&amp;#8221;</a> (an appendix to Manning's report), CCF
      Graduate Research and Public Affairs Scholar Braxton Jones lists some of the factors that help
      produce successful remarriages and stepfamilies. Many remarried couples report having closer
      and more egalitarian marriages than in their first marriage. And Jones cites research showing
      that heterosexual stepfamilies report no more stress than biological families when they avoid
      traditional gender roles and have high marital quality.</p>
     <p>The past and the present of remarriage: Historian <a href="http://www.stephaniecoontz.com/"
       >Stephanie Coontz</a> of Evergreen points out that remarriages were even more common in the
      past than they are today. The typical tension in remarriages of the past, she argues, occurred
      when the biological relatives and step-relatives actively sabotaged the emergence of love and
      obligation in a blended family, trying to deny inheritance and assistance to one set of
      children in favor of another. The typical tension in most remarriages today occurs when people
      expect love and obligation to develop too quickly, or try to force a newly-blended family to
      behave exactly like a first-marriage family. &amp;#8220;Stepfamilies have to be more elastic
      in their understanding of parental roles and more flexible about family boundaries,&amp;#8221;
      Coontz suggests, &amp;#8220;but when they achieve this, they can actually be a model for all
      families in a world where fewer and fewer marriages are marked by rigid gender specialization
      and more families have to adjust to changes such as older children returning home or an aging
      parent moving in.&amp;#8221;<br/>
      <br/> As June brings new hope and optimism for many young couples headed to the altar, it can
      mean new commitments and relationship stability for those who have loved and lost, for older
      Americans and blended families as well.<br/> &amp;#160;<br/> CONTACTS:<br/> Wendy Manning,

    <content>Olympia, (Wash), In honor of Veterans' Day, The Evergreen State College is scheduled to
     plant 7,000 American flags on the college's main Red Square on Thursday, May 21, in honor of
     the soldiers killed in Operation Iraqi Freedom, Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation New
     Dawn, since 2001. <br/>
     <br/> At noon, the names of the last 38 soldiers to be killed since the last memorial roll call
     at Evergreen, will be read, one by one as flags are planted in their names. After the last flag
     is planted, a bugler will sound the Taps. At the end of the day, the flags will be removed from
     the lawn. <br/>
     <br/> Evergreen's Veterans Resource Center (VRC) Director, Randy Kelley noted that ceremonies
     have been held at Evergreen since 2011, to honor the veterans killed in these wars, now
     declared over. "Along with many colleges and universities throughout America, we pause to honor
     those who have died. We add the last 38 names in this final remembrance roll call, with the
     hopes that those brave men and women will always be honored through the memory of the sacrifice
     that they, and their families, gave in defense of this country," said Kelley. He also called on
     the community to remember all veterans who have died in less recent wars fought by the United
     States. <br/>
     <br/> Evergreen is touted by <a href="http://militaryfriendly.com" target="blank"
      >militaryfriendly.com</a> and other ranking mechanisms as a "Veteran Friendly College," in
     part due to the active VRC, which opened in November, 2013. "Evergreen is a place where people
     from all walks of life feel welcome, a place where students can find reasoned and well-informed
     discourse on issues like war," said Evergreen's Community Relations Manager, Meryl Lipman.
     Veterans currently make up five percent of Evergreen's student body. <br/>
     <br/> The Outdoor Program (TOP) at Evergreen will also offer a veterans' backpacking trip, a
     three-day, 15 mile hike to the Alpine Lakes area along the West Fork of the Foss River May
     23-25. TOP will provide tents and group gear. Last Veterans' Day, several students commented on
     the college's Facebook page that the day was difficult for them, in part because the campus was
     closed. Kelley says he hopes to be able to keep the VRC open next year or arrange an activity
     for veterans off campus. <br/> Kelley says volunteers are needed in hourly shifts to plant the
     7,000 flags on the lawn the morning of May 21. He anticipates the setup will take seven hours
     and hopes early birds will join the effort at 6am. "We're looking for anyone who's a veteran or
     has a veteran in his or her life. This would be a great way to do service and spend time with
     other community members who value vets and their contributions."</content>

    <content>Olympia, (Wash), Fans of science, young and old will find hours of fun phenomena at
     Evergreen&amp;#8217;s 12th Annual Science Carnival Friday, May 29 and Saturday, May 30. The
     college will welcome more than 1500 visitors to its Olympia campus that weekend, including
     several hundred school children on May 29. <br/>
     <br/> Children, college students and anyone excited about science are welcome at this free
     public event. Participants can take part in experiments and workshops, attend presentations and
     observe science demonstrations. Hands on activities run by Evergreen&amp;#8217;s award-winning
     Chemistry Club offer opportunities to use equipment, interact with chemicals and animals and
     learn the Periodic Table of Elements using cupcakes. More than 100 presentations, offered over
     the two days, will allow fairgoers to engage with a broad range of science fields, from
     astronomy, biology, chemistry, computer science, ecology, geology, math and physics, among
     others. <br/>
     <br/> Teachers from Pierce, Thurston, Mason and Lewis Counties bring their classes to
     experience a college campus and observe college-level science labs. Event co-organizer Krishna
     Chowdary, a physicist and Evergreen faculty member, said attendees have come from as far south
     as Vancouver and as far north as Bellingham, thanks in part to word of mouth among
     Washington&amp;#8217;s home school communities. <br/>
     <br/> &amp;#8220;It is our biggest public event,&amp;#8221; said Marketing and Communications
     Director, Todd Sprague, &amp;#8220;and a chance to showcase the strength of the sciences within
     the context of a liberal arts college.&amp;#8221; <br/>
     <br/> An expo at the Science Carnival will showcase upper division student research projects
     and students will do presentations from 11am to 1pm. Kids &amp; Chemistry will feature
     experiments that include games with Gak (a corn starch and water-based liquid that turns solid
     under pressure), and the &amp;#8220;Humpty Dumpty&amp;#8221; experiment, which allows kids to
     build containers in which they drop raw eggs off the Evergreen Clock Tower. (Young scientists
     whose eggs don&amp;#8217;t crack will get prizes.) <br/>
     <br/> The Evergreen Science Carnival runs 10am-3pm May 29 and 30. Registration is not required.

     <p>The Evergreen State College in Olympia is among the 353 greenest colleges in America,
      according to <a href="http://www.princetonreview.com/">The Princeton Review</a>, which today
      released its sixth annual free guide to the most environmentally responsible "green"
      colleges.</p>
     <p><em>The Princeton Review's Guide to 353 Green Colleges: 2015 Edition</em> profiles colleges
      with the most exceptional commitments to sustainability based on their academic offerings and
      career preparation for students, campus policies, initiatives, and activities. The profiles in
      the guide give college applicants information about each school's admission requirements, cost
      and financial aid, as well as student body facts and stats.&amp;#160;The free 218-page guide
      is downloadable at <a href="http://www.princetonreview.com/college-rankings/green-guide"
        ><span>www.princetonreview.com/green-guide</span></a>.</p>
     <p>"Among nearly 10,000 teens who participated in our 2015 College Hopes &amp; Worries Survey,
      61% told us that having information about a school's commitment to the environment would
      influence their decision to apply to or attend the college," said Robert Franek, The Princeton
      Review's Senior VP-Publisher. (A complete report on that survey is at <a
       href="http://www.princetonreview.com/college-rankings/college-hopes-worries"
       >www.princetonreview.com/college-hopes-worries</a>.) "We strongly recommend the schools in
      this guide to environmentally-minded students who seek to study and live at green
      colleges."</p>
     <p>The Princeton Review chose the colleges based on "Green Rating" scores (from 60 to 99) that
      the company tallied in summer 2014 for 861 colleges using data from its 2013-14 survey of
      school administrators. The survey asked them to report on their school's
      sustainability-related policies, practices, and programs. More than 25 data points were
      weighted in the assessment. Schools with Green Rating scores of 83 or higher made it into this
      guide. Most of the schools (347) in this edition are in the U.S. Five are in Canada. One is in
      Egypt.</p>
     <p>According to Evergreen&amp;#8217;s Director of Sustainability, Scott Morgan, &amp;#8220;The
      college has put a lot of effort into institutionalizing environmentally friendly
      practices.&amp;#8221; He cited energy conservation, purchasing practices, diverse menu options
      in the cafeteria and food sourcing. &amp;#8220;Many of our support departments and staff
      express Evergreen&amp;#8217;s values in their daily work. It&amp;#8217;s always encouraging to
      speak with custodians, purchasing agents, administrative assistants, and many other staff all
      across the campus, who spend each working day keeping Evergreen green&amp;#8221;.</p>
     <p>The Princeton Review first published this guide in 2010. It remains the only free, annually
      updated downloadable guide to green colleges. The company is also known for its dozens of
      categories of college rankings in its annual books, <em>The Best 379 Colleges</em> and
       <em>Colleges That Pay You Back</em>.</p>

    <content><span>The Center for Sustainable Infrastructure (CSI) at Evergreen has received three
      prestigious grants in the last month. Located on the Evergreen State College campus in
      Olympia, CSI was awarded a $40,000 grant from the Seattle based Bullitt Foundation as well as
      a $10,000 Founders&amp;#8217; Grant from Seattle&amp;#8217;s Sustainable Path as part of a new
      grant program and a $35,000 award from a regional foundation.&amp;#160;</span><br/>
     <br/>
     <span>&amp;#8220;We are very grateful and proud that these prestigious foundations found merit
      in our work and our delivery. This is a vote of confidence for sustainable infrastructure
      throughout our region,&amp;#8221; said CSI Director, Rhys Roth.&amp;#160;</span><br/>
     <br/>
     <span>According to Roth, the awards were made for general support, which is, in his words,
      &amp;#8220;a good thing.&amp;#8221; A matching gift challenge allowed CSI to raise $30,000
      from private donations. The CSI&amp;#8217;s goal is to raise $250,000 in 2015, so
      &amp;#8220;We&amp;#8217;re nearly halfway there,&amp;#8221; said Roth.&amp;#160;</span><br/>
     <br/> Last November the CSI released a groundbreaking report, <a
      href="site://evergreen.edu/sustainableinfrastructure/report">Infrastructure Crisis,
      Sustainable Solutions: Rethinking Our Infrastructure Investment
      S&amp;#8203;t&amp;#8203;r&amp;#8203;a&amp;#8203;t&amp;#8203;e&amp;#8203;g&amp;#8203;i&amp;#8203;e&amp;#8203;s&amp;#8203;</a>,
     on the future of American infrastructure, compiled after in-depth interviews with 70 Pacific
     Northwest thought leaders from various industries as well as planning, government, academia and nonprofit.<br/>
     <br/>
     <span>Bullitt Foundation CEO Denis Hayes had high praise for the report, which he said,
      &amp;#8220;imbues infrastructure with a bold, new, powerful meaning, and offers an exciting
      vision of how to build a resilient, sustainable future.".&amp;#160;</span><br/>
     <br/>
     <span>The CSI report was well-received and, in this month alone, Roth is speaking in forums,
      conferences and planning sessions with key Northwest organizations, including the <a

      organized by Seattle Public Utilities.<br/>
      <br/> Roth is currently finishing a project with the Washington chapter of the American
      Planning Association (APA), a new publication called <a
       href="http://www.washington-apa.org/assets/docs/2015/Ten_Big_Ideas/23_%20updated%20use%20this%20version%20sustainable-infrastructure-a-toolkit-for-planners-wil-gen4-compressed.pdf"
       >Sustainable Infrastructure: A Toolkit for
       P&amp;#8203;l&amp;#8203;a&amp;#8203;n&amp;#8203;n&amp;#8203;e&amp;#8203;r&amp;#8203;s&amp;#8203;</a>.
      The Toolkit, scheduled for release April 17, for the national APA conference in Seattle was
      produced by a team of volunteers working under the auspices of APA-WA&amp;#8217;s
      &amp;#8216;Ten Big Ideas Initiative&amp;#8217;. &amp;#8216;Big Ideas&amp;#8217; is designed to
      bring about fundamental changes to the critical social and economic challenges faced by
      Washington communities, though use of the Toolkit is not limited to Washington state or the Northwest.<br/>
      <br/> The Toolkit draws heavily from CSI&amp;#8217;s November, 2014 report. Said Roth of the
      project, &amp;#8220;We see the urgent need for infrastructure innovation not only in the
      Northwest,&amp;#8221; said Roth, &amp;#8220;but across the country and around the
      world.&amp;#8221;</span></content>

     <p>Olympia, (Wash) - On Earth Day, Wednesday, April 22nd, The Evergreen State College will sign
      the Real Food Campus Commitment, thereby committing the campus to source 28% of food for its
      dining program from local and sustainable vendors. Evergreen's President, Dr. Les Purce, will
      sign the commitment at 5pm in the Olympia Campus Longhouse, at a reception catered by Aramark,
      after which a conversation with international activists/pranksters/parodists, The Yes Men,
      will follow.</p>
     <p>The Real Food Campus Commitment is part of the The Real Food Challenge-a national,
      student-led movement to steer college dining service vendors away from highly processed food
      and industrial farms with unfair labor and inhumane farming practices. The Campus Food
      Coalition at Evergreen led the campaign for better school food.</p>
     <h3>About The Real Food Challenge</h3>
     <p>The Real Food Challenge encourages U.S. college campuses to source 20% of their food or more
      from humane, fair, ecologically sound, local and community-based farms, ranches and
      manufacturers. Already at 25% real food, Evergreen and its dining services vendor, Aramark,
      have set a goal of annually procuring 28% real food by 2020.</p>
     <p>Evergreen joins notable colleges already striving to meet the Real Food Challenge
      nationally, among them Johns Hopkins and Cornell. Evergreen will be the first public school in
      Washington State to make this commitment, and the second school that contracts with Aramark.
      Gonzaga University was the first school in Washington to join, and student leaders at Western
      Washington University and the University of Washington are campaigning for their universities
      to commit.</p>
     <h3>Evergreen Celebrates Earth Day</h3>
     <p>In addition to the Real Food Challenge, Evergreen, a college known for its commitment to
      sustainability, will host a student-led Earth Day festival from 12pm to 5pm Wednesday, April
      22.</p>
     <p>Activities will range from tours of The Organic Farm, aquaponics facilities, and shellfish
      garden to an open mic and acoustic performances in the Student Art Gallery. There will be baby
      lambs visiting from the Evergreen Sheep Club, and trail maintenance, mushroom inoculation, and
      Generation Waking Up workshops, among others. Aramark will be on hand with their 'real food'
      vendors to hand out free samples.</p>
     <p>The Electronic Music Collective will DJ a dance party in the Longhouse from 7pm to 10pm.</p>

     <p>Olympia, (Wash) Most people don't think of prisons as training grounds for a 21st Century
      workforce, but, since 2008 the Washington Department of Corrections (DOC), The Evergreen State
      College and myriad partners have been striving unceasingly toward that end.</p>
     <p>On April 22-23, in honor of Earth Day, more than 100 Washington prison officials and
      partnering conservation, sustainability, and community organizations will converge upon
      Evergreen's Olympia campus for the Washington State Sustainability in Prisons Project (SPP)
      Summit. The two-day workshop will cover policy, partnerships, education and planning for the
      training of inmates in science and sustainability professions.</p>
     <p>Current SPP programs reach 3,000 of Washington's 17,000 inmates with conservation nursery,
      composting, threatened and engendered species captive rearing, and gardening programs.
      Renowned for its conservation work with the Taylor's Checkerspot Butterfly and the Oregon
      Spotted Frog, SPP and partners have released more than 8,000 butterfly larvae from Mission
      Creek Corrections Center for Women. The butterfly program also bolsters the established
      butterfly rearing program at the Oregon Zoo. As for the frogs, more than 625 Oregon Spotted
      Frogs have been raised and released from Cedar Creek Corrections Center since 2009.</p>
     <p>Evergreen faculty member Carri LeRoy, who has co-directed SPP with Deputy Secretary for the
      Washington State Department of Corrections, Dan Pacholke, an Evergreen alum, since 2011, says
      the summit offers a chance to reach out to new partners, including other colleges, and discuss
      the statewide sustainability policy recently launched by DOC. She is hopeful about the
      involvement of local colleges near the 12 Washington prisons. "College students in prisons can
      be great role models for inmates. In talking and working with students, many inmates begin to
      realize they are interested in furthering their educations," said LeRoy, who points out that
      education is the one of the biggest factors in mitigating recidivism.</p>
     <p>LeRoy is also excited about a summit panel on community contributions. Depending on the
      prison facility, inmates grow vegetables, which they donate to food banks. They restore
      bicycles for children and wheelchairs for the disabled. The longstanding inmate service dog
      training and pet rehabilitation programs also fall under SPP. "We ask the question, how can we
      rehabilitate people to come back into their communities? When inmates work with SPP, they are
      not just locked away; they are doing something for the community outside prison walls," said
      LeRoy.</p>
     <p>The SPP also works with DOC staff on sustainable operations and education programs to
      encourage resource stewardship and reduce the carbon footprint of prisons. Projects have
      included building upgrades, alternative energy strategies, green purchasing and procurement,
      rainwater collection systems, recycling, composting, organic farming and beekeeping.</p>

     <p>(Olympia, Wash.) The board of trustees of The Evergreen State College announced today its
      selection of George Bridges, Ph.D., as the college&amp;#8217;s next president. Bridges, who
      was selected from a large pool of accomplished candidates, has been the president of Walla
      Walla-based Whitman College, one of the nation&amp;#8217;s top liberal arts colleges, for the
      past decade. Prior to leading Whitman College, Bridges served as dean and vice provost of
      undergraduate education at the University of Washington. He holds degrees from the University
      of Pennsylvania (Ph.D., Sociology, and M.A., Criminology) and from the University of
      Washington (B.A., Sociology).<br/>
      <br/> &amp;#8220;George Bridges is an exceptional leader with deep experience at public and
      private institutions, large and small,&amp;#8221; said Keith Kessler, chair of The Evergreen
      State College board of trustees. &amp;#8220;It was clear from our interviews and campus
      forums, and from speaking with his professional colleagues, that George will be a strong and
      effective advocate for Evergreen and its bold approach to interdisciplinary teaching and
      learning. We&amp;#8217;re extremely pleased to have him as our next president.&amp;#8221;<br/>
      <br/> &amp;#8220;I am absolutely delighted by the decision,&amp;#8221; Bridges said upon
      learning of the board&amp;#8217;s action. &amp;#8220;The opportunity to serve as
      Evergreen&amp;#8217;s next president is an extraordinary honor. Given the college&amp;#8217;s
      strong national reputation as a leading public liberal arts institution and its dedicated and
      talented board members, faculty, staff and students, I view this appointment as a unique and
      rare privilege. I look forward to learning about the college&amp;#8217;s aspirations and
      expectations from all members of the Evergreen community and to meeting the many Evergreen
      alumni in every corner of the country.&amp;#8221;<br/>
      <br/> Evergreen&amp;#8217;s presidential search process was informed by a search committee
      that included faculty, staff, students and trustees. The committee also included alumni and
      representatives from beyond the college including Gerry Alexander, former chief justice of the
      Washington State Supreme Court; Lynda Weinman, Evergreen alumna and executive chair of the
      board and co-founder of the online learning company Lynda.com; and Craig Chance, Evergreen
      alumnus, past chair of The Evergreen State College Foundation and senior vice president of
      Columbia Bank. The college also held open candidate forums to which the public was invited.<br/>
      <br/> Bridges&amp;#8217; official start date is October 1, but he will be on campus for
      several events this summer and fall, including fall convocation. The annual salary for the
      position is $300,000.</p>
     <p><br/> Dr. Thomas L. &amp;#8220;Les&amp;#8221; Purce announced in May 2014 that he would
      retire this summer. He has served as Evergreen&amp;#8217;s president since July of 2000 after
      serving as Washington State University&amp;#8217;s vice president of extended university
      affairs and dean of academic programs. Between 1989 and 1995, Dr. Purce served in several
      roles at Evergreen, including vice president for college advancement, interim president and
      executive vice president. His retirement date is expected to be August 31, 2015.<br/>
      <br/> Founded in 1967 and opened in 1971, Evergreen is a nationally acclaimed public liberal
      arts institution recognized for its innovative interdisciplinary approach to teaching and
      learning. The college has been noted as one of the nation&amp;#8217;s best colleges by the
      Princeton Review, the Fiske Guide to Colleges, US News and World Report and Washington
      Monthly. Evergreen has also been recognized as one of the nation&amp;#8217;s top
      &amp;#8220;green&amp;#8221; colleges and one of the best schools for military veterans. In
      addition to its undergraduate offerings at its main Olympia campus, an upper division program
      in Tacoma and a reservation-based program serving Native American communities, Evergreen
      offers three graduate programs: a Master in Teaching, Master of Environmental Studies and
      Master of Public Administration. The college has approximately 4,200 students.</p>

     </p>
     <p>Gone are the days of rappelling off The Evergreen State College clock tower, but
      mountaineering has been a tradition at the college since Everest pioneer Willi Unsoeld served
      among its founding faculty members.<br/>
      <br/> On Wednesday, February 11, The Outdoor Program at Evergreen presents legendary Northwest
      climber, Fred Beckey, now 92, who has made hundreds of first ascents in the Cascades and
      across the nation, and has written several definitive texts on climbing. Beckey will speak in
      the Evergreen Constantino Recreation Center (CRC) at 7:30pm. Tickets are $5 with student ID
      and $10 for the general public. Parking is $1 on campus after 7pm.<br/>
      <br/> The Outdoor Program (TOP) has undergone several iterations since Unsoeld ran it in the
      1970s. TOP is currently geared toward educating students in climbing basics, but also in
      kayaking, backpacking and other outdoor activities. Beckey is the first national speaker to
      come to Evergreen sponsored by The Outdoor Program in over a decade.<br/>
      <br/> The Olympia Mountaineers, the Warehouse Rock Gym and Mountaineers Meetup groups have
      been instrumental in spreading word of the event as far as Seattle and Portland.<br/>
      <br/> While Beckey is unlikely to revive the clock tower rappelling tradition during his
      visit, Evergreen is currently installing 40 foot outdoor climbing wall near the CRC.</p>

     <p>Tacoma, Wash - The prospect of growing one's food may seem daunting to a city dweller. But
      urban gardening provides all kinds of benefits - from exercise and contemplative time to
      healthy, organic fruits and vegetables and a stronger connection with the earth.</p>
     <p>The Evergreen State College Tacoma Program will offer a four-session life enrichment course
      called "Intro to Urban Gardening," Monday evenings, February 23-March 16, from 6 to 8pm. The
      class costs $100, which includes materials and a home consultation with course instructor Dean
      Jackson.</p>
     <p>Jackson is executive director of Hilltop Urban Gardens, a food sovereignty and social
      justice organization in Tacoma; Jackson has been growing food in urban settings for 10 years
      and is a master gardener in Pierce County.</p>
     <p>Course topics will include site selection, building a raised bed, starting a planting
      calendar and creating proper soil for plant health. During the first session, students will
      start seeds indoors that will be available as transplants at the end of the class.</p>
     <p>This non-credit course is geared toward the general public and beginning gardeners with an
      interest in growing their own food.</p>

     <p>(Olympia, Wash.) As part of a national presidential search that generated nearly a hundred
      applicants, the Board of Trustees of The Evergreen State College announced this week that it
      has selected four finalists for on-campus interviews in January and February. They
      include:</p>
     <ul>
      <li><strong>George Bridges, PhD,</strong> is president of Whitman College and previously
       served as dean and vice provost of undergraduate education at the University of
       Washington.&amp;#160; He holds degrees from the University of Pennsylvania (PhD, Sociology,
       and MA, Criminology) and from the University of Washington (BA, Sociology).</li>
      <li><strong>Rhona Free, PhD,</strong> is provost and vice president for academic affairs at
       Eastern Connecticut State University where she previously served as director of the Center
       for Educational Excellence and as a professor in the Department of Economics.&amp;#160; She
       holds degrees from University of Notre Dame (PhD and MA, Economics) and Sarah Lawrence
       College (BA).</li>
      <li><strong>Margaret Madden, PhD,</strong> is provost and vice president for academic affairs
       at State University of New York at Potsdam, where she is also a tenured professor of
       psychology.&amp;#160; She holds degrees from University of Massachusetts, Amherst (PhD,
       Psychology, and MS, Psychology) and University of Wisconsin, Madison (BA, Psychology).</li>
      <li><strong>Luis Pedraja, PhD,</strong> is provost and vice president for academic affairs at
       Antioch University Los Angeles.&amp;#160; His previous professional appointments include vice
       president of the Middle States Commission on Higher Education.&amp;#160; He holds degrees
       from University of Virginia (PhD, Philosophical Theology and Religious Studies), The Southern
       Baptist Theological Seminary (M.Div, Theology), and Stetson University (BA, Religion).</li>
     </ul>
     <p>According to board chair Keith Kessler, the trustees hope to make a selection and a job
      offer in March.</p>
     <p>"This is an exciting time at Evergreen," said Kessler, one of eight trustees appointed by
      the governor to oversee the state's nationally acclaimed public liberal arts
      college.&amp;#160; "We've been inspired by the number of exceptional candidates interested in
      this position," he noted. "Evergreen's distinctive educational approach&amp;#8212;including
      interdisciplinary teaching and learning, an extraordinary focus on student responsibility for
      educational choices, and an emphasis on putting theory into practice&amp;#8212;calls for a
      leader who can think beyond the limits of traditional higher education to help students
      succeed in a changing world. It has been 15 years since we last hired a president and given
      the qualifications of our finalists, I think the college and the wider community will see why
      we're excited about the possibilities these candidates represent."</p>
     <p>Since opening its doors in 1971, Evergreen has become nationally recognized for its
      innovative academic programs that combine subjects that are traditionally taught separately.
      America's top college guides regularly rank Evergreen as one of the nation's best institutions
      for its strong academics, nurturing community and reasonable cost. Sierra magazine and the
      Princeton Review have repeatedly named Evergreen as one of the top "green" colleges in the
      nation for its commitment to sustainability and achievements in sustainable practices,
      operations, academic programming and community outreach.</p>
     <p>Dr. Thomas L. "Les" Purce announced in May that he would retire in summer 2015.&amp;#160; He
      has served as Evergreen's president since July of 2000.</p>
     <p>Prior to accepting the presidency at The Evergreen State College, Dr. Purce served as
      vice-president of extended university affairs and dean of extended academic programs at
      Washington State University in Pullman, Wash. Between 1989 and 1995, Dr. Purce served in
      several roles at Evergreen, including vice president for college advancement, interim
      president and executive vice president.&amp;#160; His career also included roles at Idaho
      State University&amp;#8212;as special assistant to the president and director of the Research
      Park and economic development&amp;#8212;as well as service in local and state government and
      in the private sector.</p>

    <content>On Saturday, April 18, Grays Harbor College will welcome the City of Olympia's Mayor
     Stephen Buxbaum to speak on the topic of civic engagement in a time of rapid change. <br/>
     <br/> Buxbaum will speak to The Evergreen State College's Grays Harbor program class, "Health
     From the Inside Out," but the event is free and open to the public. <br/>
     <br/> Using examples from 30 years of work in community and economic development, Buxbaum's
     will discuss best practices used by individuals and communities to address climate change.
     "Social, economic and environmental challenges are coming at us simultaneously and very
     rapidly," said Buxbaum, who believes issues such as food and energy policy need to be addressed
     at a community and individual level if they are to be successfully resolved. <br/>
     <br/> In the 1980s Buxbaum worked extensively on sustainable agriculture initiatives, including
     organizing farmers' markets and distribution cooperatives for organic farmers. He organized
     Farmers' Wholesale Cooperative, one of the nation's first and largest distributors of
     organically grown produce. He later worked for the State of Washington as an executive manager
     of community and economic development programs. While working for the state Buxbaum, was
     directly involved in developing projects such as community centers, day care facilities,
     farmers' markets, homeless shelters, affordable housing and water and waste water facilities
     across the state of Washington, including Grays Harbor County. He is a founding member of the
     Safe Energy Leadership Alliance, an organization of local elected officials from Pacific
     Northwest states and Canada who have raised concerns about the transport of coal and oil by
     rail. <br/>
     <br/> In 2012-'13 Buxbaum collaborated with two faculty members from Evergreen to teach a
     program in Grays Harbor - "Telling Our Stories - What Makes Communities Work." As a result of
     that class, the Grays Harbor resident students self-published a book called "Voices from the
     Harbor", the first anthology of stories and poems about the Grays Harbor area to be written by
     people from the region. <br/>
     <br/> Evergreen runs one eight-credit upper division program each quarter at Grays Harbor as
     well as other four-credit classes, ensuring that Grays Harbor Community College graduates have
     access to upper level college courses in their own town. <br/>
     <br/> Evergreen's Director of Evening and Weekend Studies, Sarah Ryan, whose department
     oversees the Grays Harbor program, is proud of what that program has achieved. "Evergreen
     classes offer Grays Harbor and inland students the opportunity to collaborate on projects that
     make a difference in the harbor community." <br/>
     <br/> Buxbaum, who will teach a full program at Grays Harbor in 2015-16, was moved by his last
     experience instructing in the area. "I am very grateful that I have had the opportunity to work
     with students from the Harbor Region," said Buxbaum. "The work they did collecting information
     about their communities was transformational."</content>

     <p>The Willi Unsoeld Seminar Series, a program of The Evergreen State College, welcomes
      Oscar-winning documentary filmmaker Audrey Marrs to Olympia on Thursday, January 29. Marrs
      will spend two days working with Evergreen students and faculty and will give a free, public
      presentation at the Evergreen Longhouse on Thursday, January 29 at 7pm.<br/> &amp;#160;<br/>
      Marrs, a 1999 graduate of Evergreen, is famous for the film Inside Job, a 2010 expose of the
      2008 global financial meltdown, which she produced in partnership with Charles Ferguson. Her
      first film, No End In Sight, also produced with Ferguson, hones in on the Iraq war and
      decisions made by the Bush Administration, which have led to the current and seemingly endless
      conflict. Both films have garnered awards and accolades, including prizes at the Cannes and
      Sundance Film Festivals. Inside Job won the 2011 Oscar for Best Documentary Film. She is
      currently producing a film with a worldwide scope, about climate change. She will show a three
      minute clip from that film during her January 29 presentation.<br/> &amp;#160;<br/> Though she
      left Olympia in the 1990s for California, Marrs is looking forward to revisiting her alma
      mater. &amp;#8220;I&amp;#8217;m excited to know what is going on at Evergreen,&amp;#8221; she
      said, &amp;#8220;and to meet people who are so young and interested.<br/> &amp;#160;<br/> In
      the 1990s, Marrs played a significant role in Olympia&amp;#8217;s music scene with bands such
      as Mocket and Bratmobile and worked at The Olympian and Rainy Day Records, but she credits
      Evergreen with giving her permission to be herself. &amp;#8220;I had a lot of freedom there to
      figure out what I wanted to do. And I don&amp;#8217;t really know how to do anything but
      that,&amp;#8221; she admitted.<br/> &amp;#160;<br/> As an example, Marrs was working as an
      independent curator of gallery exhibitions in San Francisco, but she changed career paths in
      24 hours to produce No End In Sight. &amp;#8220;If I had come from a different perspective, I
      (might) have been more attached to the past. But I was ready to let that go in a moment; there
      was no hesitation.&amp;#8221;<br/> &amp;#160;<br/> Evergreen&amp;#8217;s Vice President for
      Academic Affairs, Michael Zimmerman, who oversees the Willi Unsoeld Seminar Series, is
      thrilled to bring Marrs back to campus. &amp;#8220;Audrey is a creative force, a passionate
      advocate and a true Evergreen success story. Since she has strong roots in Olympia this is a
      wonderful opportunity for the college and the community to welcome back one of our
      own.&amp;#8221;<br/> &amp;#160;<br/> Willi Unsoeld is a household name among mountaineers,
      famed for his first ascent of Mt. Everest&amp;#8217;s West Ridge in 1963. But Unsoeld had a
      deep intellectual life beyond the sport of climbing. As a philosopher and founding faculty
      member at The Evergreen State College, Unsoeld embodied the interdisciplinary spirit of the
      institution. After his death in 1979, a legacy was created in his name for an annual seminar
      series at Evergreen. Marrs joins a long line of past speakers who have included Jim Hightower,
      Yevgeny Yevtushenko, Terry Tempest Williams and Unsoeld&amp;#8217;s climbing partner, Tom
      Hornbein.<br/> &amp;#160;<br/> To schedule a press interview with Audrey Marrs by phone in
      advance of her talk, please call or email Meryl Lipman (below).</p>
