   <p>How is college funded, and on whose dime? How much should a state or nation pay for the
    education of its citizens beyond secondary school, and to what extent should the expense of
    higher education fall upon individuals and their families?</p>
   <p>In this program, students will explore the financing of higher education as a case study
    through which they look at larger economic and social issues&#8212;and around which they build
    applicable skills in finance, economics, business, writing, communication, and research. What is
    the history of funding for higher education? How do various economic, social, and cultural
    models impact funding and society? What is the role of economics and finance? What about
    fundraising, grants, and scholarships? What are the related issues of social justice, equity,
    access, and political advocacy?</p>
   <p>The program will include lectures, seminars, workshops, films, and guest speakers. Students
    will participate in collaborative projects and research, and learn from a variety of community
    leaders.</p>

    the truth is that archaeologists are scientists&#8212;and they often spend more time in the lab
    than finding the Ark of the Covenant. This program trains students to be such scientists.
    Incorporating archaeology, chemistry, math, research, and project presentation (written, oral,
    and visual), we seek to teach students all stages of the scientific method, from gathering data
    to presenting original research at conferences.</p>
   <p>The study will benefit students who are looking for general chemistry credits and who have an
    interest in archaeology. No previous experience in chemistry or archaeology is required, but
    students should be able to use a scientific calculator and have completed high school algebra.
    High school precalculus is strongly recommended.</p>

   <p>It is a common misconception in environmentalism that if you can educate people about a
    problem, they will automatically take steps to solve it. In reality, environmental problem
    solving is much more complex. It requires a good grasp of the ecological system involved, the
    structure of government, and public policy&#8212;as well as the ability to work effectively in
    groups.</p>
   <p>This program covers basic ecology, political science, economics, and statistics in order to
    provide students with the necessary background to understand environmental problems. We will
    look at ecosystem structure, community ecology, population biology, and some of the ways in
    which human activities impact ecological systems. In the political science component, students
    will learn about the structure of government at several levels and the interaction of federal,
    state, and local government. We will take advantage of the proximity of the state legislature by
    attending committee meetings and observing the legislative process firsthand.</p>

   <p>When you look at different people and times, you'll consider how people's lives which seem
    inexplicable to us made complete sense to them, and how understanding and interpreting their
    experiences helps us make sense of our world. You&#8217;ll challenge your assumptions about how
    individuals and communities live and make meaning with knowledge.</p>
   <p>Students who study history at Evergreen develop a historical imagination and cultivate
    insights that link the present with the past and bring valuable awareness to the future.</p>
   <p>You'll prepare for professional work or graduate study by learning how to interpret evidence,
    create narratives about human experience, and develop sound arguments. You'll learn how
    historical knowledge is formed by creating it yourself, learning how to do historical research
    and interpreting what you encounter. You'll learn how to understand secondary sources, research
    archival materials, practice oral history methods, and shed light on the human experience by
    honing all these skills.</p>
   <p>The analytical, research, and writing skills developed by studying history provide strong
    preparation for many fields, both in history and related disciplines such as classics and
    archaeology, European studies, American studies, law, and creative writing.</p>
   <p>Evergreen graduates with a history background have gone on to careers as lawyers, college and
    public school teachers, librarians, archivists, museum professionals, journalists, fiction

   <p>Human activity shapes the environment. Earth warmed out of the last ice age about 10,000 years
    ago, enabling our species to develop stable societies and transform the experience of being
    alive. Agricultural activity emitted greenhouse gases that changed Earth&#8217;s air, water, and
    land. People changed, too, improving technologies and creating written and artistic records of
    their ideas and histories. Today, we understand our impacts on the environment in ways
    incomprehensible to our ancestors, and we are challenged to mitigate those impacts with
    knowledge, skill, and political will.</p>
   <p>This program will examine changes in the Earth system, human understanding of those changes,
    and the history of technological efforts to enhance human flourishing and shape our impacts on
    the environment. We'll study multiple drivers of climate change such as Sun-Earth interactions,
    volcanoes, industry, consumption, and greenhouse gases. We&#8217;ll consider the changing role
    of science in providing the understanding required for people and planet to thrive together.</p>

    in the Northwest and beyond. Founded upon visionary leadership and long-term relationships
    between Pacific Northwest tribes and Evergreen, programs in Native studies embrace indigenous
    knowledge as a field of multidisciplinary study. Faculty develop culturally relevant curriculum
    that strengthens the college's connection to indigenous peoples of the United States, Canada,
    Aotearoa, and the Pacific Rim. Classes take place both on the Olympia campus and at area tribal

    <em>Offered Winter 2018&#8211;Spring 2018</em>
   </p>
   <p>In this program, we will critically examine some of the colonizing aspects of U.S./Native
    history, anthropology, and the tourist industry that motivated many mid-20th and early
    21st-century indigenous artists to &#8220;speak truth&#8221; through paintings, sculptures,
    carvings, basketry, bead work, photography, prints, performance, and multimedia installations as
    a means of maintaining and defending Native identity and tribal sovereignty.</p>

   <p>Through lectures, films, readings by indigenous scholars and writers, student-led seminars,
    guest speakers, weekly studio or research workshops, and field trips to mainstream and tribal
    museums, students will critically reflect on the power, meaning, and contributions of
    contemporary Native art, not only to indigenous people, but to the non-Native world. Students
    will develop skills as writers, artists, researchers, and potential allies by studying
    indigenous scholarship and the artworks of indigenous artists from the 20th and 21st centuries,
    and by developing research papers and presentations.</p>

   <p>Political economy is an interdisciplinary field combining economics, history, politics,
    sociology, and philosophy. It asks who has what, who does what kinds of work, how did it get to
    be that way, and how it could be different. Political science deals with systems of government,
    and the analysis of political activity and behavior. While there is overlap, political
    economists focus on economic processes, their relation to power and public policy, and their
    influence on people's lives and social institutions while political scientists focus on the
    study of governments and how they work.</p>

    transformational conversations about the connections between personal, community, and planetary
    health? Throughout the program, we will recognize that our individual choices can help us create
    both personal health and a sustainable environment, a conscious life and a positive presence in
    society.</p>
   <p>Students will have an opportunity to learn in many ways, using diverse modalities, including
    working with multiple intelligences and mindfulness practices. We will integrate somatic
    learning into our studies, including movement, qigong (a Chinese system of physical exercises
    and breathing control), and expressive arts workshops. Our inquiry will ask us to attune
    ourselves to the wisdom that is available and present in our mind-body awareness. We will
    participate in community readings, community service, rigorous writing assignments, and critical
    study of important texts.</p>

   <p>This program questions and explores the division between the purpose art has traditionally
    served and alternative ways art can operate. We will pursue this inquiry through multiple
    learning modes, including studio practice, contemporary art theory and art history lectures,
    screenings, readings, written assignments, individual creative projects, and seminars.</p>
   <p>We will ground the program in two studio practices: animation and printmaking. Because both
    originate in drawing, students will devote significant time to learning drawing skills and
    theory. Students will work back and forth between drawn and reproduced images, animation and
    intaglio printmaking, static and moving pictures. They will then develop independent projects
    that further their own inquiries into these practices. Creating individual and collective
    projects, students will gain basic studio skills and foundational visual and media literacy.
    They will learn a range of creative concept development practices, enhancing their knowledge of
    alternative ways of making and thinking about art.</p>

   <p>The outsider philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche once confided in a letter that his only home was
    between the lines of his writing on the page.</p>
   <p>What does it mean to write yourself into being?</p>
   <p>This program will investigate the complex relationships between an author, the reader, and her
    pages: who or what speaks in a literary work? What emerges through a reader&#8217;s work of
    interpretation&#8212;a new work, a translation? This program&#8217;s goal is to help you become
    a more skillful and inventive interpreter, a better reader, and ultimately, a more adept writer.
    We will study and practice various methods of interpretation of literary texts, focusing on
    works of autobiography, self-portraiture, and self-creation as alter-ego. We will read poetic,
    dramatic, and narrative works as well as essays. Readings will include, among others, Martinican
    Aim&#233; C&#233;saire&#8217;s <em>Return to My Native Land</em>; <em>Illuminations</em> by
    Arthur Rimbaud; Emily Dickinson&#8217;s poems; Jean Genet&#8217;s <em>The Miracle of the
     Rose</em>; and Ana&#239;s Nin&#8217;s <em>Labyrinths</em>. Students will engage in study of
    interpretive methodologies, read critical essays in philosophical and psychological approaches
    to literature, and practice interpretive writing as well as creative exercises in writing
    themselves into being on the page. The program is preparatory for advanced study of world
    literature.</p>

    <title>mathematics</title>
    <intro><p>Mathematics is much more than working with numbers and solving equations. It underlies many daily decisions, is crucial to thinking critically about what we read and hear in the media, is the language of science and technology, and lies behind the games we play and the work we do. Mathematical and quantitative thinking is incorporated across the curriculum. You’ll find it woven into programs and courses involving science, sociology, psychology, economics, linguistics, and the arts. We also offer opportunities to study mathematics as a discipline in its own right: both pure and applied and from beginning to advanced.</p></intro>

    <title>physics</title>
    <intro><p>Our approach to physics and astronomy is experiential and hands-on. You work in small groups in labs and workshops to understand the laws and physical models describing interactions involving matter and energy. Physics is taught at all levels and with many other disciplines, including animation, music, sports, sustainability studies, and philosophy. If you’re embarking on an academic pathway in the sciences, you can obtain a foundation in university-level physics that also include calculus and chemistry or computer science. At the advanced level, you can learn physics and astronomy in integrated programs that include applied mathematics and advanced physical chemistry.</p></intro>

    <title>political economy</title>
    <intro><p>While studying political economy, you will learn the ways in which the U.S. and global economies have been organized and reorganized, how systems of economic and political power operate, and how they are changed. You can study the history of empires in structuring the global economy; examine food systems and agriculture; and mass media’s role in social relationships. You’ll learn how social change has occurred in the past so you can be a more effective agent of change. Finally, you can explore alternative visions for economies and societies that promote justice and environmental sustainability. </p>

    <title>somatic studies</title>
    <intro><p>Somatic studies look at mind-body ways of knowing and living in the world and are guided by the assumption that cultivating body-based intelligence (<em>soma</em> in Greek) can be used to help individuals grow and change. This field of study offers opportunities to explore body-based literacy as it relates to leadership, communication, and engagement with social issues. You'll learn in many ways (academic, experiential, contemplative), using diverse modalities and multiple intelligences, studying somatics through body-centered approaches to mindfulness, movement workshops, creative expression, the arts, and academic work in psychology, health, and more.</p></intro>
